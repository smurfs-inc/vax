This 60-year-old female nurse (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 to 23Dec2020 at 0.3 mL single on left deltoid to prevent getting the COVID vaccine, for protection. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed in her mid twenties, in the 80s, she had asthma when she was a child, then it stopped and resurfaced in her mid twenties, ongoing eczema diagnosed years already, a long time ago and unspecified allergies with medications.  There were no concomitant medications. She received the vaccine on 23Dec2020. She has a lot of allergies in Dec2020, and had some side effects, and she got through it ok. Her side effects were some swelling of arm, a rash developed, like 5cm x 4cm at site of injection, chills and shivers, and a bronchospasm cough on 24Dec2020. Arm swelling event started 24 hours later, no more, it was stable for 24 hours, and the 3rd day, went down, was a little raised, the next day was flat but still red. She had recovered completely. The 4th day was a good day. The patient stated she had some allergy shots she had to go through before, this was no different. Rash was no more, it was gone by 27Dec2020. She was still able to go to work. Chills and shivers started 24 hours later, and took for 48 hours intermittently, she had since recovered completely. The patient stated this was all nothing different than getting like the flu shot. Bronchospasm cough event only took another 48 hours, the difference was, even when she calls it bronchospasm, it was close to when she had an asthma attack, but no chest tightness, shortness of breath, she just would cough, spasm in Dec2020 and stop. She had recovered completely. The patient stated she had no symptoms at all before the vaccine, she was healthy, she made sure nothing was going on, that she was not tired, had no cold, she took no medications for this, as she wanted to know how her body reacted and if it can handle it. They says it was ok to take paracetamol (TYLENOL), but she did not, but the second dose she would, now that she knows and she was comfortable through it. She did have some mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores that came up in Dec2020, but nothing to run to the hospital to the doctor for. Clarifies this occured after she received the vaccine. The outcome of the event allergies, mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores were unknown. The outcome of rash at site of injection was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of other events was recovered in Dec2020. The causality between Pfizer COVID vaccine with some swelling of arm, rash developed 5cm x 4cm at injection site, chills and shivers, bronchospasm cough was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Swelling was the size of large lemon.  Smaller amount of swelling noticed in right armpit, also.  Vaccinations had both been done in my LEFT arm and greater swelling was in left armpit.  Had fever, chills and headache this same day requiring me to take round the clock doses of Tylenol.  By the following day, fever and chills were gone but swelling of armpit still present.  Swelling is slowly diminishing but still present by day 3, as I send this notification.

This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I called my PCP, he told me to take Tylenol is painful and to put warm compress if they were uncomfortable. They are still there, they don&#39;t hurt or painful.

                                                At 4hrs post vaccination experienced extreme muscular pain between shoulder blades. The following week, as far as I can recall, I began to have tingling from the right shoulder blade down to my hand. I thought I may have a pinched nerve and went to the walk in clinic to be seen by the nurse practitioner that is in the same office as my primary. She examined me and thought it sounded like a pinched nerve and said I was swollen in the area of complaint. Cervical and thoracic x rays were taken (normal) and was told to take Flexeril and steroids. Pain was getting worse and primary told me to  begin taking  Meloxicam and have physical therapy. I have been doing both beginning 1-11-2021. Pain continues with no  improvement. Do not know if my symptoms are caused from the Covid shot, but just seemed to me that it was quite a coincidence that muscle pain began on the same day as receiving the shot.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 60-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (manufacturer unspecified), lot number: EL4238, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 21Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis. Patient&#39;s known allergies are Penicillin, Peanut and Dairy. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient&#39;s whole/entire arm was killing her; she was hurting across her shoulder blades down to fingers. Her elbow and wrist were hot and she was feeling a tremble in hand which she has never had before. She later added that her joint in elbow and shoulder was now reaching down to her arm. She couldn&#39;t even wear her watch today to her work, it felt swollen, like there was liquid in it. She also can&#39;t lift her arm, move and the pain was like going into her back. The patient was taking Aleve and Advil and &#34;it doesn&#39;t take away all but it takes away enough that she can function.&#34; She also bought a topical ointment to help numb the area and she was wearing a pain patch on my back. The outcome of events was reported as &#39;not recovered&#39;. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 60-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL1283, subcutaneous on 20Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, anaemia, blood pressure, cholesterol. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EU9899, in the left arm on 30Dec2020 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and experienced swelling and redness at the site. Concomitant medications included liraglutide (VICTOZA), labetalol (LABETALOL), diltiazem (DILTIAZEM), valsartan (DIOVAN), rosuvastatin, metformin, aspirin and iron. The patient thinks that it wasn&#39;t given to her intramuscularly. This is a potential inadvertent subcutaneous administration of the BNT162B2. This patient received her second dose on 20Jan2021 on the side of her arm and reported that it was swollen, red, and hot, but has gotten 100 times better&#39; over the last 6 days since administration. She was asking for efficacy of the incorrectly administered dose. It was further stated that in the middle of the night, her arm was red almost like a little bullseye and she said that she was getting burning, and pins and needles down her arm, and a fullness in her hand like her hand was swollen. She said that she still kind of feels it. As the days progressed on day 2, 3, and 4, the swelling got more intense, the circular red swollen area got worse to the size of like a small baseball. She was feeling okay other than that. Today was day 6 and it was not as red and was more black and blue, swelling went down 80 percent, she still feels a little bit of the pins and needles and the fullness in her hand. She said that there was like a big knot that was very hot. It was a hard like knot at the injection site. The injection site was really big, round, hot, red, and had a knot that lasted; adds it is still there but 99% better; and she had tingling down her arm with pins and needles in her hand. She noticed it was little red a couple of hours, like 8 hours later; but by the next day it was circular, more red, swollen, itchy, and burning down her arm. By the third day, the site had a big, red, hard knot; still burning down her arm and with pins and needles down her arm. She added that her hand felt like a fullness in her hand filled with fluid. By Friday the swelling at the site was gigantic. The site swelling is improved but the redness was more of a black and blue now. Her arm has been very dark red, discolored, swollen, painful and has nerve pain described as &#34;hot tingling down the arm like pins and needles&#34; to her hand. She states that she has a very large knot at the injection site. This was in her non-dominant arm. She spoke with two of the pharmacists that she works with and they looked at her arm and both felt like she may have received the injection subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. The outcome of events was not recovered. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

Was swollen for 5 days, then fever chills, body aches (fever 0f 100.2)  Right hand was so painful was intolerable, truly had to wait for it to pass, nothing helped except for soaking in Epsom salt bath, which was short live.  Have had arthritis in this thumb but not for approximately 8 years.  Entire hand was swollen and not useable.

                                                Vaccine given 2/9/21. On the afternoon of 2/12/21 I began to have joint pains in my right wrist. By 2/10/21 in the morning both elbows, knees and wrists were sore. Elbows and right knee felt warm to the touch. Nodules or red spots developed around the joints. I could barely walk or climb in and out of the car, the bed, and had a very difficult time standing up from the toilet or a low chair or couch. No fever, but did have a few chills with teeth chattering at least twice.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills. Pain in calves, upper back, same on both sides.  6:38 weirdly, from the bottom of my thumb to halfway up my arm there is pain. Both arms simultaneously. Worse on the  left.  8:11 pm after bundling up and using a heating pad, plus extra heat, chills are lessened. Lymph nodes very sore in neck. Eyes are not quite as dry. Everything else is the same.  8:48 pm jaw really aches. Intestinal discomfort. Going to bed.  10:39 pm pain from jaw extended up into left ear. Upper part of throat hurts.  March 5, 2021  4:00 am. Body aches have lessened. Left arm sore at shot area.  5:45 am  eyes definitely dry, but not nearly as dry as yesterday. Numbness in mouth , tongue and face has lessened, but still uncomfortably present. Definitely worse on the left side. Little bit of tingling on the left, mostly on cheek from chin to ear. Headache gone. Lymph nodes sore and swollen .  7:00 am went on a walk. Noticed some achyness throughout body. Very tired.  10:51 am The tingling and numbness remain in my mouth, tongue and cheek up to my left eye.  Very tired. Lymph nodes still swollen and sore.

                                                On  the day of the shot, by Noon I could feel the vaccine moving into my throat and my  face. My throat and left cheek started to swell and turn slightly red.  I took more Benadryl and called my allergist in the afternoon. They told me I needed to get to the hospital for treatment.  At the hospital, they gave me steriods, benadryl and Pepcid in an IV.  After allowing this to work, they sent me home with a  steriod prescription for 60Mg for the next 5 days.  They asked me to follow up with my allergist if I had other issues , they also told me that I would not be able to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Over the next several days, I continued to have issues with this redness that had grown over my entire face. I looked like I was totally sunburned.  I did not feel well, the redness was very hot, and I struggled with some breathing. I made an appointment on  Monday morning with my allergist, and they adjusted my allergy medicine and gave me more asteroids for 5 more days.   They advised me to use my nebulizer treatments as needed to remove the heaviness in my chest. This redness and swelling has moved around my body, almost as if I can see where the vaccine is at in my body.  It went from my head to my chest/back and right arm. Down to my abdomen, and then down below my knees.  In the morning, it is usually in my face and then it moves around during the day.  I can feel this fluid moving around in my body because the redness brings swelling/fluid.  This last saturday 3/6/2021 was horrible, it was in my right ear and right foot.  It was very painful and made me very dizzy. I struggled to walk.  Then on Sunday morning, I felt fine all day.  Today Monday, it feels like it is in my right foot again, but I feel like It is  getting better.

                                                This patient was vaccinated approximately 1 hour prior to presentation here with her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She felt fine right after her vaccination but as she drove to her destination where she was going to take a walk, she started to develop left-sided facial burning and swelling.  That prompted her to call her PCP in that office recommended she come back to the vaccination clinic to be evaluated.   I evaluated her at approximately 2 PM.. She was feeling well for the most part with the exception of left-sided facial burning and swelling and a little bit of redness over her left cheek.  She denied fevers, chills, itching, other areas of rash, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, tongue swelling, lip swelling, wheezing, chest pain, or difficulty breathing.   She recalls a penicillin allergy at age 5 or 6 but cannot remember the reaction. She has never reacted to a vaccine before.   Initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 134/73, a pulse that was 70 and regular, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She had normal mental status and her lungs were clear. The left side of her face was slightly swollen over her left cheek as compared to the right with some slight increased flushing on the left side. There was no stridor, she was speaking comfortably, and her lungs were clear with good airflow. Her heart demonstrated S1 and S2 with regular rate and rhythm.   I administered 2 doses of Benadryl, 25 mg with each dose about 15 minutes apart with her last dose at approximately 2:25 PM.   I rechecked her vital signs at 2:50 PM and her blood pressure was 138/79 with a pulse of 70 and regular and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her lungs were clear and she was moving good air. I did take a relook at her face which was improved with decreased swelling.   At 3 PM, because she was doing much better, I discharged her to home with instructions to use Benadryl 50 mg when she got home and then 25 to 50 mg every 4 hours today. If she develops any respiratory symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, cough, breathing difficulty, swollen tongue or swollen lips, as well as increased facial swelling, she will call 911 to be evaluated.   She should not get the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                As I pulled up for the 15 minute wait period the symptoms started 5 minutes after I received my vaccine.  A tingling feeling up my left arm to back of my neck. My neck stiffened and then my throat started to close.  Not to where I can&#39;t swallow but just like when I eat food that I&#39;m allergic too, it closes up. The nurse that was overseeing me was holding the umbrella over my car window with the rainfall.  All of a sudden their was lightning &amp; thunder. The nurse threw the umbrella because she was shocked from the lightning. She started to talk to all the other around her and forgot about me. Since I could still swallow I didn&#39;t get her attention. When she returned she asked me the time so I had to pull my phone out. She didn&#39;t know the time of my 15 minutes and sent me away. As soon as I got out of the parking area but still inside amusement park, I started to feel my cheeks becoming numb and my right eye was blurry.  I quickly moved over to the side lane still inside of amusement park and waited.  I called my husband and told him that with the heavy rain I didn&#39;t feel safe driving with my right eye being blurry.  I waiting another 15 minutes before driving home.  That evening the blurriness came back, my eye&#39;s &amp; forehead was tender to touch but no headache.  Only pressure in my head.  My symptoms of closed throat, swollen cheeks, pressure in my head and blurriness continued on Friday, March 12th, Saturday, March 13th, Sunday, March 14th and Monday, March 15th.  As of today, no other systems other than feeling my body has inflammation.

Friday morning 05Feb2021 when she got up, got to the point where she got out of bed and couldn&#39;t get up. There was no possible way for her to get up. Her husband had to buy her a 3-in-1 potty chair so she could just stand and pivot, seriousness was provided as disabling, could understand hospitalization, but confirmed she never went to the hospital.

Took Tylenol but it gradually rose to 102.3. Took 3 hours for fever to go down. By 5:30 fever was gone &amp; I was feeling better. Next day I felt great but by three days later I had a fever blister &amp; very sore, dry and stuffy nose which lasted two weeks. And headache as well. I?m thinking because of stuffy nose. I did have Covid last March/April 2020 so I have heard that I would have side effects.

I went back to bed no food no medicine,  Most information I read and was aware is that it would be better with sleep.   Only to wake up at 8:30pm with a 102.7 had 500 mg acetaminophen went back to bed.   Woke up Thursday morning at 9:45am fever free.    Friday afternoon  I noticed swelling on my left neck area.  Just inside my left clavicle.  I made a Dr appointment for Monday and Dr. found several Lymph nodes swollen as well as under my left arm pit area.   Due to some chest pain she sent me for a chest x-ray.

                                                I was submitting my events daily on website and two days it tells me my session has expired and won&#39;t let me report anything.  On Sunday night, March 21st, I started with very painful joint and muscle aches with fatigue.  The next morning I felt terrible and could barely function, I had a bought with diarrhea that lasted almost the entire day and had no energy.  I developed a large lump on my left clavicle area that seemed to be filled with fluid.  My knees I had replaced are still very painful today ( 7 days post vaccine).  I phoned my Dr. yesterday and they told me to take 1000mg of Tylenol 3 times a day.  I am doing this now for the second day with some relief.  I feel this is very unusual to feel this way 7 days after the vaccine.  On day 1-2 the only symptoms were a sore arm from the vaccine.  Saturday was actually a good day with no symptoms, the other symptoms started on Sunday.  I feel like my heartbeat is irregular also but my BP is good.  I would like to be able to to report daily on v-safe like I was the first few days.

Being an MD ( anesthesiologist), I examined the lump and felt like a size of a walnut in a shell. I immediately called my Primary and I went to his office. We discussed about my Covid vaccine. And he requested Chest X-ray. In the future, head and neck CT.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 17:30 (at the age of 60years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. There was no medical history; no known allergies. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITA D); ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C); fish oil; ubidecarenone (COQ10); magnesium; and zinc; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that her lymph nodes swelled on the same side where she received the shot. Also, the left side of her checks down to neck and shoulders felt weird, she can&#39;t quite explain the feeling; she thought she was getting Bell&#39;s Palsy which is one of the adverse reactions. She was alarmed as she was unaware of the swelling of the lymph nodes. The adverse events occurred on 19Mar2021 (16:30). There was no treatment received for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Received first shot on 3/15/21. On 3/25/21, I developed a rash (hives) around 6:30-7pm. After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

The hard lump was as big &amp; wide as my right hand and began 2 inches above my elbow up to the place of injection.  When my morning alarm went off, I was very fuzzy and extremely weak.  I  was unable to go to work or remember a lock combination I use every day.  My energy began to return the next day enough to work a half day but returned to bed for the afternoon.  The tiredness was all but gone by 8:30 pm.  Reaction began Sunday morning and was gone by Tuesday night.

                                                Following my first Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine 03/11/21:  **Note, I went through 1 1/2  days dull ache in arm no concerns &gt; days 2--5 went through a HYPER-WELL (no age aches, prior-hurt finger didn&#39;t ache, energy, ladies room habits back to what I reported to daughter &#34;age 20!&#34; for these four days, amazing, enjoyable, then &gt; day 6 very early am woke up with swollen neck lymph nodes half-palm sized rocks on neck, breathing difficulties (lungs not neck), bad dull intrusive headache (different pain from Migraine, or low-hydration pain), cough dry and have called this my HYPER-CRASH because I could barely walk, backward C-shape abdomen hurt (dull ache big always &#43; frequent stabbing pains from below bra bottom line to left abdomen down side then curving to my right across bottom abdomen at both leg-attaches-to-abdomen locations. Difficulty breathing, pain, extreme swelling over upper abdomen when I even drank water to swallow morning Hydrochlorothiazide pill and would stay swollen for 4-8 hours with continued surprise to me gulps of air throughout period, weak, nausea but not vomiting, dizzy, unable to walk more than a few steps at a time, fever taken and wavered from 95 to 99 degrees (my usual body registered 97.8 degrees) but never over 99 degrees, and only over 97.8 degrees perhaps three times very little above it and only for a few hours.  &gt;&gt;I went to Urgent Care in person no better at all on 3/24/21/roughly day 12 after vaccine shot 3/11/21 (Urgent Care) which took blood and urine tests determining roaring infection and blood in tests and a CT CONTRAST scan should be ordered by my PCP asap at appt PCP already scheduled 3/26/21 but she couldn&#39;t order CONTRAST version the PCP would need to and she prescribed three antibiotics to take over next 2 weeks &gt;&gt; I went to PCP 3/26/21/day 14 after vaccine shot and he ordered CT Scan but insurance required pre-auth and they refused it at first so PCP referred me to GI SPECIALIST who again referred me for CT CONTRAST test, which I did have on Friday afternoon 4/16/21 (Clinic), and I await the results today 4/19/21.  Today I continue to have pain abdomen, though softer and throbbing, same C-shaped region, HUGE issue even drinking water with Hydrochlorothiazide pill only for many hours as abdomen swells at bottom bra-line center in a palm size mound for hours, and back hurts badly, solid headache which may be only right side of head more than left but I am taking nothing for any symptoms afraid of GI issue.  NOTING AGAIN: Yes I was diagnosed roughly 2015 with a single incidence of diverticulitis/osis by GI SPECIALIST in Town and went through series of Colonoscopies and tests, but tests only determined incidental few polyps removed over all tests and no incidents at all since that. Knowing what I know of my body and health, the trigger seemed to be the first shot of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccination which remarkably seemed to react first with a few days of better health than I have had for decades (eating, moving, energy etc. for my age), where after days of extreme great health and energy (where I went nowhere, and still did not push myself much) my body then crashed to unable to move much or even breath normally for many days after and with a multi-level infection in my gut that needed three antibiotics and after those I still hurt in the same locations.  I cannot confidently rule out the Vaccine as the cause, and what I know of my body suggests in fact some &#34;overdrive&#34; function in my system was triggered and then caused the crash that resulted in infection and that continues to interfere with my walking, eating, moving, breathing, and even drinking a small glass of water today.  Final note: PCP confirmed I should take the second Vaccine Pfizer shot, which I did on 4/1/21 - same site, Lot #EW0150, after which second vaccine shot I had the same two days of dull arm pain, and I continued to finish the antibiotics until finished (but pain though softer continues to today).  I did not experience a #-Days HYPER-WELL episode then HYPER-CRASH after this second vaccine shot, only the arm ache, but throughout was still very unwell (breathing, pain, no activity, weak, unable to eat, swelling, headache, cough intermittent, back hurts, etc.) throughout, and same to this day 4/19/21 as I await CT CONTRAST results. I felt compelled to share I feel this was triggered by the first Vaccine shot, and would not have happened had I not had the Vaccine shot. Thank you.

I took advil and went to sleep. On 4/12/21 I woke up with my arm very swollen and it was hot to touch. By the afternoon I was worse and the area was turning red so I went to the Urgent care and diagnosed with Cellulitis (which I have never had and didn&#39;t understand at first what this was about). I was treated and returned to my regular Doctor for follow up. I still have this thing and although it&#39;s better it&#39;s not gone as of this report and it is causing me distress in typing, cleaning and so on.

Also developed a fever blister/cold sore on upper lip at the same time. It&#39;s been about 23 days since first shot and I still have the rash under my right eye, but cold sore is gone. Did not see doctor. Treated cold sore with Blistex and just put vaseline on rash at night.

Caller stated that her sister was allergic to nothing, and she has never had incidences of itching like that, where the itching was so bad that she was stripping down and the patient&#39;s daughter was patting the patient down with witch hazel. Caller stated that ER released the patient and gave her some medications and such. Caller stated that a day or so later, there was a second round of reaction: the right side of the patient&#39;s face swelled up and numb and her lips were numb, like when people have a dental procedure. Lips were numb for a while. Upon completion of the medications she was given, the reactions stopped. Patient regularly saw the family doctor. She would go back to see her Doctor on Thursday. HCP Information was unknown to the caller, but caller stated that her sister had been recommended to go to her PCP and get an Epi Pen. Caller stated that knock on wood, so far, her sister was holding her own, and it had not happened again. Caller stated that she was reporting the data that her sister gave to her after having the Pfizer vaccination. Caller stated the patient had an anaphylactic reaction twice that caused her to go to the emergency room. No relevant tests were done. Caller stated that she had the dates that she had her shots and where she had her shot at. Caller stated somebody called and reported it already. Caller stated she was trying to press three but never could figure out which prompts was. Caller stated they said if she called this number, they would tell her at the medical information department if this occurrence has happened to other people, like statistics. Caller stated they tried to call this number, but it was too long of a wait. Caller stated that she did not have the vaccination card, she never asked for them. Caller does not have card with her at time of call for LOT, NDC, Expiry date. Caller stated that she knew that all the COVID vaccines are just in the Emergency Use Authorization stage and in clinical trials, but caller really thought that all manufacturers should be advertising that they would like feedback from patients. Caller has not heard anything from any of the manufacturers saying that people are welcome to reach out and report side effects. Caller states that she only knew to call because she used to be a Home Health Worker, and she thought this is an important data. Caller has never seen on any of her 19 TV channels about calling to report. Caller stated that the girl who first answered her call, read a clinical data sheet about joint pain being seen in 23% of patient&#39;s and not knowing a percentage for anaphylactic reactions, caller was wondering if this was true. Caller verified that she just wanted to ask basically that patient was not alone, if other people might have had that happen too. Caller stated that she tried to call, and it would ask another question and it would say press 1 or 2, then it would ask other questions and it would say press 1 or 2, she never got an option 3. Caller asked: how much percentage, has anyone reported this side effects weeks after the second dose. Caller was wondering if this reaction could have been from the vaccine. Investigation Assessment: No. The outcome of the events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: EW0ISO) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included she had lupus, sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications not reported. The patient previously took Pneumonia Vaccine on 04Mar2021 (Anatomical Location: Left arm); took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: the lot number starts with ER something and then it ends with a 3) as single dose for covid-19 immunization; took azathioprine for lupus and had allergic reaction; took belimumab (BENLYSTA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Lot Number: PV7G; Expiration Date: Jun2023, NDC: 49401-088-01, Number on the side: 0147098) to an unspecified date, self injection once a week for lupus. She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn&#39;t super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn&#39;t done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn&#39;t stop and she told herself that if it didn&#39;t stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn&#39;t been eating a lot so she hasn&#39;t had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn&#39;t swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can&#39;t recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn&#39;t even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn&#39;t help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren&#39;s disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous&#34; was recovered on 17Apr2021. The outcome of events &#34;Feeling of warmth, Vaccination site pain, Hyperaesthesia, Vaccination site erythema, Tiredness&#34; not recovered. The outcome of the event &#34;Headache&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 03Feb2021 17:40 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation, offered at the health system she works for and administered at hospital.

The patient experienced I feel pretty awful in Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, ear pain on 03Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, sense of fullness in ears and lymph nodes on 03Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 05Feb2021, body aches on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache on 04Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, sleepiness on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, fatigue on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, body temperature: 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021 with outcome of unknown. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The course of events was as follows: Patient expected that since she just had COVID in Dec2020, she thought her response to the vaccine would not be severe because she already had some immunity from the infection. The evening of the vaccine, on 03Feb2021, she experienced ear pain and a sense of fullness in her ears and lymph nodes. The ear pain was almost immediate after vaccination. On 04Feb2021, the next day, she woke up with a headache. It was an unusual headache. It did not go away with Tylenol. Then about halfway through the day, she developed significant body aches like when she had COVID. She also experienced extreme sleepiness like when she had COVID too. She took Motrin and had to lie down during her work day. The Motrin did help. Then mid morning 04Feb2021, she got a chill. She couldn&#39;t get warm enough. She had no fever. She checked multiple times. Her temps ranged from 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021. She experienced fatigue. She did not know the seriousness for any of the side effects she experienced. As of 05Feb2021, her headache has improved. She was still experiencing sleepiness and fatigue. The chills she developed mid day. She had not them right now. She has better and worse moments just like when she had COVID. She was worried about the second one. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021, COVID-19: positive in Dec2020. No other relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and sleepiness. A Product Complaint was filed.

                                                The first day when I woke up I had really bad back pain and I was really sleepy. towards the afternoon I became very itchy. The itching and hives would become increasingly worse. I didn&#39;t take it for anything. On Saturday I went to work still itching I called the nurse at work on the hotline and explained what was happening. I was told to take Benadryl but could not because it would make me drowsy. I finished work and took the Benadryl after. I also started to break out into hives, the itching was turning into hives. On Sunday I got up for work and the hives were large and like welts. This was all over my body.  The itching was still present as well. I was advised to go to an urgent care or a doctor. On Monday morning I woke up and everything was swollen: my face, my lips. I went to the Dr&#39;s office where they gave me steroids and an epi pen as well as oral steroids. After the steroids, the swelling went down after a few days. The itching had also ceased. The itching lasted from Friday up until Monday when I got the steroid shot on Thursday.

                                                2nd dose:  Stinging a few minutes after shot, I felt really woozy, and then started shaking all over having a hard time processing and talking.  Went home the next day (Wed)  fever, chills, headache, 24 hours better, returned to work on Thursday, day (2).  Day (3), Friday, I  noticed a red rash at the site of the injection earlier in the day, but no symptoms, just a little tender.  Friday evening I noticed a little SOB,  a little burning sensation under my skin on both forearms, and a couple times felt a little dizzy, but I didn&#39;t think much about it.  Day (4) Saturday morning, I went to spin class, I felt a little off, halfway through spin class I noticed I was struggling with some breathing, thought it was because I was wearing mask, but pushed through.  Ran a couple of errands afterwards and then noticed the SOB was continuing, my skin started burning again under forearms and now my legs with tingling into my feet.  At this point I decided I probably needed to go home.  On my way home my chest started to hurt in the very center of my chest, and slowly felt like some pressure, with squeezing sensation.  Then starting at the center of my chest I could almost feel what felt like a numbness creepy from my chest to my throat.  I went to the ER.  My legs felt really wobbly and had a difficult time walking, and was feeling dizzy.  They ran a variety of blood work and tests.  They noted my D-dimers were elevated and (4) lymph nodes enlarged.  They ran an additional series of test and released me at 10pm with follow-up to cardiologist.   I am still experiencing SOB, not as bad, and the burning sensations under my skin.

She started to have swollen lymph nodes. It was only a little bad at first and then she started getting more and more swelling. She spoke with her facility&#39;s RN who suggested she use some cold and warm packs/compresses and also take some Tylenol to deal with it. She has had the swelling for this many days now. It&#39;s not bad swelling but she her lymph nodes are still so swollen. She thought it was a regular reaction, but now it&#39;s been too long. Her lymph nodes are not swollen humongous.

She verifies the numbness in both her cheek and arm started occurring on 03Jan2020 around 7-8pm. She is fine today and then she&#39;ll start to feel the numbness again in her cheek and arm. She clarifies the numbness comes and goes. It comes in the morning and then goes away and then the numbness starts again. She started to feel numb in her face and cheek, like when one gets a Novocain at the dentist office and it starts working- it&#39;s like the same feeling.

                                                fever; nausea; general feeling of unwell; soreness at site; redness; whole upper arm was swollen after the injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient, Respiratory Therapist) reported that a 61-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE , Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 around 6:00 PM in left upper arm at 0.3mL single dose for COVID Prevention. The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Getting my 2nd dose today. I have paperwork from Pfizer that I need to fill out for their data keeping.  Pain was excruciating for nearly 2wks and started to settle down a few days ago, where I don?t have to sit with a heating pad or take motrin and flexaril.  f/u 1/28/21-&#34;My neck still hurts, worse on certain days, but is bearable. I haven?t had any imaging done and just heard of another person with same symptoms. My 2nd dose was fine. No pain at all, not even at injection site. I will keep you posted if anything changes. I?m hoping it will just go away on it?s own. I?ve heard it takes months&#34;.  Referred employee back to PCP.

                                                facial flushing for 1 hour after shot. Redness on nose and cheeks for about an hour. No hives, no itching. Didn&#39;t notice until I left the vaccine site and was on the way home in car because covered by mask. Note I am a very fair skin, freckled red haired woman. I was very, very nervous and had gotten myself to the point of tears. Perhaps the flushing was from that. Have had similar flushing when drinking red wine.  Swelling in lymph node in supraclavicular area on same side as shot. Has happened with Flu shot once. Slight fever for a short period of time and fatigue. I continue to have slight shortness of breath from having covid on. 4/3/20. Nothing different.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

                                                At 0900 this morning my face next to the right side of my mouth started itching. I immediately felt it swell. I looked in the mirror and could see the left lower part of my face (lower cheek by the edge of my mouth) swell and my right upper lip started to swell. I took a Benadryl (25mg oral tablet) and my roommate drove me to the Emergency Room. That area of my face continued to swell and impacted my lower lip as well. My lips were numb and tingling and I could feel my cheek swell more inside my mouth as it was touching my teeth. I was monitored (vital signs and pulse ox) for 90 minutes and received 20 mg of pepcid oral tablet and 10 mg dexamethasone oral tablet- both 1x only.

                                                I am on infusion for severe psoriatic arthritis, and was doing well. Two days after injection it was as if the effects of my infusions were cancelled. Extreme widespread stiffness, pain, joint swelling and heat, muscle weakness and pain. I also had swollen lower lip and have had an increase in headaches and nausea. Two weeks after the injection I awoke with my right arm swollen, hard, and itchy. The arm and my lips have resolved, but I am still having all the other problems. I have reported these symptoms to both my primary doctor and my rheumatologist.

It felt like the stiffness was creeping up my neck. After about a hour I felt my ear lobes tingling and the left side of my face in the jaw area  seemed a bit swollen and felt a little numb. It resolved and I had only a sore injection site the next day and no other symptoms. I&#39;m wondering if I should be concerned about getting the second shot

                                                Around 11, 11:30 the pain woke me up because it was so bad. It was hot and there was a big lump under my left arm pit (was very tender). I did not go to sleep like that. I did not have any symptoms by the time I went to bed. I also felt hot, and then cold, then hot, then cold, I would feel too hot and then too cold, freezing, I could not keep my temperature under control. I had to call in at work during the weekend I was feeling so bad. I had a lump under my armpit the size of a fist and I could not close my arm completely. It was huge and painful. I decided to go to a clinic over the weekend (unsure if Saturday or Sunday) to seek medical care and they ran some labs and a CBC to check for infection.  All results came well no infection. They suggest to keep taking Tylenol. By Monday or Tuesday I started feeling well enough to return to work. The lump was still present and took about a week to go down. The injection site also was sore for a while, about a week also like the lump.

                                                Immediately: headache, left eye pain, nausea, cold sensation and felt ?weird? but thought it was normal and thought I might feel flying for a bit but that it would wear off so I did not report feeling anything at the clinic. I left the clinic and got in the car to drive home and felt a weird feeling in my throat reminiscent of my esophageal spasm and then it felt like someone had their hand on my throat squeezing my throat and felt like I needed to take deep breaths to expand my lungs. Within a minute or two at most, my lips, tip of my tongue, tip of my nose and face beside my lips and under my cheeks started to tingle and go numb.  My insides felt swollen.   I had a doctors appointment and went there after picking my son up at home.  I reported my feeling to my doctor who prescribed a steroid for 3 days and told me to also take Benadryl or Claritin, which I did. However, today is day 4 after my vaccine and today is the first day my insides don?t hurt.

My arm was not sore but that muscle was.  That seemed to calm it down (Advil). The next morning, I was very swollen under my right armpit - I figured it was my lymph node. It was uncomfortable and very noticeable - quite swollen for three days. It took about a week to go back to normal. I also had abnormal fatigue and that took longer to resolve - that took about two weeks to be resolved.

On 3/22/21 and continue to have swelling in my left armpit (Lymph node area), spasms in my left shoulder blade and surrounding soft tissue adjacent to my left armpit and neck area.  I have experienced soreness in that arm/shoulder but not at the injection site - overall bicep and clavicle area. I have been able to alleviate symptoms to a degree by taking a tylenol once or twice a day but the pain is limiting some of my daily activities to a degree.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot Number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in upper left arm on 25Feb2021 9:00 (at the age of 61-year-old) as single dose for virus (COVID-19 immunisation). Medical history included chronic pain, pancreatitis, allergic to medications, old injury in her right arm, menopause and an ongoing mass in parotid lobe discovered in 2019 with CT scan. MRI performed in Mar2020 and CT scan in Oct2020. She stated that they are just watching it because it has not changed. Well defined borders are present, caller stated that doctor was unconcerned. Her mother had heart disease. Ongoing concomitant medications included ibuprofen for chronic pain and gabapentin from 2019 for chronic pain. The patient also took unspecified medication for pancreatitis. She has taken all kinds of stuff after pancreatitis but they do not work. The patient got deadly ill from the flu shot. Unsure of onset age, vaccine/brand name, or vaccination date. She stated that it was before 2003, possibly in the late 1990&#39;s or early 2000&#39;s. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On unspecified date the patient experienced diabetes; on 25Feb2021, the patient experienced dizzy, stomach feels odd, hot flashes, severe fatigue, sweating, stomach aches, acid reflux, upper abdominal pain radiating to back; on 26Feb2021 she experienced tightening of chest every so often; and in Feb2021, she had headache. It was further reported as follows: The patient stated that she took the Pfizer shot, clarified that she received the Covid-19 vaccine, on 25Feb2021, not quite 2 weeks ago. She stated that she had a little bit of a reaction after receiving the vaccination while there, so they were monitoring her. She has been experiencing hot flashes, sweating, and stomach aches for 2 days. She cannot get rid of hot flashes and that she has not had a hot flash in 2 years. She states that she has been down for 2 days with fatigue, that it&#39;s really bad. She is inquiring if the side effects that she is experiencing are common side effects and if it is ok to get 2nd shot.  Her second vaccine is scheduled for 17Mar2021.  She stated that she wanted to take the time to make a report as she is allergic to medications. While inquiring about dates of vaccines and side effects, she stated that she was experiencing tightening of chest every so often. She stated that she only had a few days of stomach pain and she has not stopped eating. She is unable to concentrate (unspecified date) and she has been experiencing headaches, experiencing them twice in 2 weeks.  She also reported that she has been having upper abdominal pain radiating to her back. This concerns her, every time she gets it, it scares her. She had pancreatitis when she was 36. It is a nightmare thought. Does this sound like maybe she is possibly starting Diabetes? She reported that this shot has triggered everything. She has an old injury in her right arm. Her arm is killing her, her hands are swelled up, she has acid reflux again, she felt terrible. She stated that the dizziness not as strong as it was at the beginning. The fatigue it comes and goes and that she has spurts where she is energetic.  She stated that it&#39;s more on than off. She is no longer having stomach aches. She compared the pain to pains of constipation. She also stated that she was constipated after receiving the vaccine on unspecified date. She had nausea at the beginning.

She experienced upper abdominal pain yesterday and some this morning, but it was mostly in her back this morning. Her Sweating is off and on. She experienced headache just a couple of times but that she has not had one in a while.  She stated that they lasted only an hour or two, and that she does not usually get headaches. She suggested that these may be due to sinuses and weather change. She has been taking Ibuprofen twice a day as treatment. But she normally takes Ibuprofen for chronic pain. Supposed to be 3 times a day but she does not want to take that much. She stated that all of this could also be stress related and that this could also be menopause. The patient recovered from stomach aches on 02Mar2021. The outcome of the events dizzy, sweating, tightening of chest every so often, upper abdominal pain radiating to back, headache was recovering; the outcome of stomach feels odd, hot flashes, severe fatigue, acid reflux was not recovered. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

The patient took Tylenol and Advil in the afternoon and it helped it go away. The patient took one of each. It was reported that the COVID headache is like none other and she had the headache again. For the COVID headache if you take things it doesn&#39;t make it go away. When the patient said she had the headache again she meant she had the same headache that she had in April. The events did not require ER or physician office visit. Outcome of injection site pain was not recovered while it was unknown for the other events. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Developed fever up to 102 degrees F as of 9 PM on the day of vaccination, plus muscle and joint aches, chills, and headache. These symptoms continued the next day along with sore arm, and fever went up to 103.6 degrees F. By bedtime on the second day, March 16, fever, aches and pains, and headache were gone. However, I felt very fatigued and I was sweating profusely all night. I had to get up and change soaked clothing three times during the night. Within 3 days, my arm was still very sore and the lymph nodes in the armpit of the vaccinated arm became very sore. I also began having diarrhea several times per day on approximately the third day after vaccination and this has continued to the present.

                                                About 36 hours after my first dose, I woke up very thirsty and with &#34;gummy,&#34; sticky eyes.  My moisture-producing glands, particularly my salivary glands were significantly affected and I had, in effect, (drug-induced?) Sjogrens Syndrome.  My salivary glands felt uncomfortable, perhaps because they were swollen. The symptoms have diminished somewhat in the past two weeks, but have not resolved.   I visited my PCP on  04/02/2021 and she advised to see her again if the symptoms did not continue to resolve on their own.  Note that in 2014, I had a similar, but more severe reaction to a single dose of Nitrofurantoin and regained nearly complete  salivary gland function after 9-12 months.

After she received her vaccine she felt fine. On Tuesday night she started to feel some itchiness. She said the itchiness got worse over the next two days. She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine, the front of my neck developed a very itchy, warm rash, my lymph glands on the right side of my neck swelled so much that it was difficult to swallow even liquids without pain, and I had a fever of about 100. The itchy area on my neck continued to worsen, and despite the application of OTC anti-itch medications and me taking Benedryl, it got larger and warmer, and the itching became even more severe. At one point my throat was so swollen, I started to think it was closing up and that I&#39;d need to go to the hospital. The discomfort continued into the next day when I contacted Teledoc, and was prescribed an antibiotic, and prednisone, which helped. The itching is still present, but managed by regular spraying of an aerosol cortisone. And the swelling has gone, but there are slight scars like one would get from a scrape. My throat is much better, and my fever is gone.

                                                Not sure exactly when this problem began, but definitely after vaccination. Both hands feel very arthritic. Most proximal knuckle of left long finger is visibly enlarged and painful to any pressure. That finger is very uncomfortable almost all the time. Neither heat nor Ibuprofen decrease pain. No specific finger on the right hand is more affected, but that hand is frequently painful and stiff. Again, neither heat nor Ibuprofen have any effect on the pain. I had not noticed these symptoms prior to Covid-19 vaccination.

I could barely move fingers on either hand without a lot of pain and could only make half a fist because of swelling.  Reaction appeared to involve both hands and left elbow only.  It was very sudden and required a visit to the Rheumatologist for relief.

Spread over first week, across temple and forehead and chin, later on belly (which spread to cover 1/4 torso below waist on front side), between legs on both sides at top of inner thighs, latter on outer thighs of both legs. Felt like needles pricking skin if fabric touched skin. Lasted three weeks. However, at three weeks I am sill not over the rash. I can now function normally, even though the skin is still red and slightly itchy.  Oddly, the rash was strong on the right side of my body with a fainter mirror image on the left side. I reported all this on the V-SAFE app.

Two days after injection I got pretty bad diarrhea that lasted several days. I also got the chills/shakes the second night. Then I got a pretty bad Eczema flare...on my breasts. It continues at week two. My left armpit HURT terribly for almost a week. Tylenol did not relieve it at all. I also had quite sore Lymph nodes across my chest/side of neck.

The issues move from area to area and seem to inflame fatty areas most. I thought this would go away and didn&#39;t document with pictures, like I should have.  I now have a couple of pictures and will continue to do so. I&#39;ve tried hot baths, cold packs, hot packs, elevating the area and topical relievers. I couldn&#39;t feel the heat of the pain reliever on the affected area. This has been absolutely debilitating and I&#39;ve had to miss some work because of it.

                                                I had a full blown red rash all over my body; red lesions all over my leg and my back and red marks and scratches all over my chest, my back, legs; it downed the swelling and the itch but I still have red rashes and scratch and red marks all over my body; had a severe reaction; The next day after vaccine I had extreme hives, red welps all over by body from head to toe; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer. A 61-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Formulation: Solution for injection), via unspecified route of administration on Left arm on 24Mar2021 12.00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization and second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Formulation: Solution for injection), via unspecified route of administration on Left arm on 24Mar2021 12.00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Relevant medical history includes Von Willebrand Type 2 bleeding disorder. Concomitant medications include Lisinopril. It was reported that the next day after vaccine I had extreme hives, red welps all over by body from head to toe on 25Mar2021 at 13.00 PM and treated with Prednisone/Atarax and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Prior to vaccination, the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient weather tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine is unknown. Upon follow up on 31Mar2021, there wasn&#39;t side effects with the first shot, it was with the 2nd shot, developing rash on the second day, red rash, welts, swollen, severe scratch marks on chest, swelling on shoulders and welts, arms with welts and scratch marks, and major scratch marks and welts on lakes, and big old red patch on my left calf. The next day went to Clinic and saw a doctor, he couldn&#39;t even believe it, he was gasping at what he saw, gave me prednisone for severe allergic reaction, today is the last day of treatment, I started prednisone on Friday and the last day is today. It did take down swelling itching and pain, now I am left with patches, welts, scratches on my chest and red lesions and big red patch on my left calf. Can send pics if you want. I want to know how to get rid of the patches, or when will they go away? can you suggest what I can take? I am going to go to a haematologist next week, because I do have a bleeding disorder. It looks to me like these are going to be the scars and they are not going to go away. It feels like someone took their nails and just scratched., looks like they aren&#39;t going to go away. &#34; Response: Spoke from attached document: explained that Pfizer is unable to provide treatment and management recommendations and referred to HCP.

                                                Six days after my 2nd vaccine I had an anaphylaxis reaction.  Out of the blue while I was driving my face started to burn like acid was rubbed on it. It got really hot and turned very bright red. Then my lips began to feel like they had been sunburned badly. Then my forearms both started burning and also turned bright red. I was very anxious. Had two bouts of diarrhea. All this occurred within about a 20 minute time-frame.  I chewed up 4 children&#39;s Benadryl (50mg) and the redness, burning and anxiousness subsided mostly. My heart rat was still over 100 bpm even after  6 hours. (Usually my HR is 68-70 bpm). I slept for 12 hours and the next day seemed fine.  This has occurred two more times since that first time. The 2nd reaction being 5 days after that first one and the 3rd reaction being 5 days after that. Same reaction, same treatment and same outcome.

A 61-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization.

On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reactions, tired, earache, swelling, itching, stinging, peeling, hurt my, throat was swelling, couldn&#39;t sleep, rash, burning, the neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse. It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 08Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) (at the age of 61-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer (2-time breast cancer survivor), had lymph nodes removed, and has low thyroid. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for low thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, calcium, chloride, chromium, copper, folic acid, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin, selenium, silicon, thiamine, vanadium, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, vitamin k nos, xantofyl, zinc (CENTRUM SILVER WOMEN 50&#43;) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine (PEPCIDAC) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Patient previously took shingles vaccine on an unknown date (reported as number of years ago) for immunization, flu shots on an unknown date for immunization and also previously took the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6200) (at the age of 61-years-old) on 15Feb2021, intramuscular administered in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation, and experienced injection site pain in right arm, sore arm and swollen gland. Patient stated having what was considered typical, like a sore arm and did have some swollen glands with the first and second dose. It was also reported that after 1st and 2nd dose, there was injection site pain in right arm. After second dose she developed shingles, or what was later found out to be shingles, she had extreme pain in her hand. She thought it was injured or something, it was very painful. She got shingles blisters on her hand, and then also got some on her arm, the opposite arm as the injection. Her dermatologist and internist verified it was shingles. Her internist said it may have been triggered by the vaccine. She clarified it started in the palm of her hand and then traveled up her arm on the opposite side of the vaccine, she got the vaccine in the right arm and the shingles in the left arm. She felt quite ill as a result of the shingles. Her dermatologist put on Valtrex, three times a day. It helped with the spread; it stopped spreading. Her dermatologist was not associating it with the vaccine, and she was not sure she was either. After not feeling well for several days she told internist and he was confident that the vaccine was what caused the shingles. She doesn&#39;t remember for sure the event extreme pain in left hand, but it was within a few days after the 2nd dose. The swollen glands started within 24 hours, as well as, the sore arm. It wasn&#39;t anything she didn&#39;t expect. Like with the flu shot maybe a little worse, but it wasn&#39;t severe. Her sore arm was not ongoing. It recovered completely by the next day. Swollen glands came back when the shingles first happened, but they initially began within 24 to 48 hours, for both doses. After the second dose she took two extra strength Tylenol again on the first night again; she just took it once after the 2nd dose. Pain in the hand was 98 to 95 percent better. Her doctor did whole blood work up (unknown results) just to see her white count (unknown results) to rule out something else. The blisters were too small for the dermatologist to scrape and get a biopsy. She did not get the most current 2 dose vaccine for shingles, she only got one dose and that was a number of years ago, she was going to get it but then COVID happened. The outcome of event herpes zoster and pain in extremity was resolving while for other events was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible. Information about Lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 22Apr2021 12:10 (at the age of 61-year-old) as unknown single for COVID-19 immunization. This report was not related to a study or programme. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was first time had flu shot made her very ill, next year doctor suggested she should just have half of a shot instead of full shot to see if she tolerated it and she was able to tolerate that. She had not any other problems with flu vaccines in general. Some of the other vaccines, she was just supposed to take Benadryl with them because of some of the filler ingredients people put in things. She had previously had the 1 dose shingles vaccine, but she had gotten probably shingles probably a couple of months after that so they encouraged her to get the 2 part shingles vaccine at a later date and told her to do the pre-medicate routine like Benadryl day before, day of and at least 2 days after shingles vaccine doses and if any major problems call for help. She did not have a noticeable problem from the 2 part shingles vaccine. Some of the times depends on what filler ingredients people use. She was allergic to nutmeg which was used as an emollient oil or it&#39;s called Myristicin something or other oil; if something has too high a dose of mannitol it can cause a problem. She has a very long list of allergies and high sensitivities; if it was a high enough sensitivity it goes in allergies list, even though it may not be a true allergy. Family has lots of allergies. Regarding prescribed indication additional details: She had 3 doctors who initially advised her to get the vaccine including her primary care physician, oncologist and haematologist; this was because she was a high risk person because of various health issues. Her haematologist 2-3 months ago when she had her last appointment with him he was saying to get the shot and prescribed the epi-pen at that time; no one was having it yet, but he expected she would have some sort of reaction to it not able to be covered by Benadryl alone. Medical history included ongoing platelet disorder Verbatim: Unidentified platelet disorder, Lots of allergies, cardiac murmur, ongoing asthma, osteoarthritis, glucose tolerance impaired, hypoglycaemia slow thyroid and back and neck pain. Concomitant medication(s) included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for hypersensitivity (50mg taken as needed), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for hypersensitivity (10mg daily), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma (250/50 twice daily), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism (137mcg-1 tablet daily), methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) (20mg tablet twice daily), salsalate, colestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT) (2-500mg tablets 3 times daily), sucralfate (CARAFATE) (1mg tablet 4 times daily-dosage verified with caller as milligrams and captured as provided), loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]) (2.5/0.25 takes 2 tablets of that 4 times daily), calcium carbonate (CALCIUM OYSTER SHELL [CALCIUM CARBONATE]) (Alternates dose of 500mg and 1000mg on days takes Vitamin D), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) (250 mg), vitamin D (50,000 units every other day taken), vitamin B12 (1mg injection every 14 days), clonazepam (KLONOPIN) (2-1mg tablets at bedtime), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma (10mg tablets at bedtime) and cefixime (FLEXERIL [CEFIXIME]) taken for back pain, neck pain (10mg tablets 3 times daily as needed). On 22Apr2021, Onset time: She had a note saying her eyes itchy at 12:20, but they were itching before that because she waited long enough to report it; so onset time was less than 10 minutes when her eyes started itching. Then her pulse; she could feel chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard. They did check her pulse while she was in their initial observation and her pulse was only in the 70s, but oxygenation was at 96%.When at doctors office less than 1 hour before that reading, oxygenation was at 98%.Recorded at 12:30 eyes itching much worse, throat felt like it was starting to tighten, heart felt like it was starting to race. By 12:50 hands were starting to swell. She had already been pre-medicated with Benadryl before this before she went down to get the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, she had Benadryl in her system. She had that same morning with her morning meds had taken Zyrtec and Benadryl in anticipation of getting the possibility of getting the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine because she has to pre-medicate for vaccines just in case she starts to react in anyway. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines was not administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Emergency Room taken from the location where vaccine administered-they gave her Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot had her sit for basic observation then sit for extended observation. In that time period telling them her symptoms were going on, increasing. They gave her another 50mg Benadryl even though she had already had 1 before and then called emergency room, took her down, left her in waiting area even though she had heart and chest palpitations. Physician Office seen prior to event on 20Apr2021, seen after event 27Apr2021. Primary Care Physician didn&#39;t hear anything in lungs either visit. Not admitted to hospital; seen in emergency room, theoretically she got treated; however her basic blood pressure and stuff even with what they were doing was higher than when she was triaged in the ER; blood pressure was up and something else,oxygenation level moderately reduced from when she came down to when she was just let go; however her symptoms were worse when she was leaving than when she got there. She knows what they gave her while she was there was IV of normal saline, solumedrol and IV Benadryl. Thinks they later gave her Tylenol tablets. Finally got them to do an EKG because kept saying her chest was getting worse but that was several hours after she was back there even though came there having chest pains. In her opinion this hospital was not taking reaction seriously. Not admitted to hospital even though symptoms were worse and blood pressure higher on discharge, well above her normal levels. Currently trying to get them to explain why they took so long to do anything for her. Finally did a chest x-ray on 22Apr2021:discharge papers say abnormal x-ray and they gave a couple of different possibilities as to what that might be so Primary Care Physician wrote a prescription to get a follow-up chest x-ray to make sure that everything is fine and back to normal and not ongoing or progressing or anything because they gave some strange things: what their impressions were: findings: there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. It says the left lung appears clear; cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits; impression restates non specific right findings there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. This was from front and lateral views of the chest x-ray at 19:00pm 22Apr2021. 2 ECGs: She guesses this is what they call EKG not, relevant point is that in the notes there for the records: Says abnormal ECG compared with blah blah blah, hard to find when exactly they wrote this, trying to get the exact wording for each of the two. Machine results CED, which caller explained is what they call themselves now instead of ER, notes for MD interpretation; one done at 17:53 , other at 21:32. They both say there was slightly different readings, however both say abnormal ECG. One of the wordings that is in both. She had no further details to provide regarding relevant testing/investigations. She had to be in the ER back in the room for several hours before they would do the EKG and that&#39;s only because she said I have chest pain and standard procedure is to do an EKG, had been back there for hours, they had done no tests, the only thing they did was basic blood panel, had not done a troponin or heart enzymes test, had not done EKG that&#39;s why she knows they were not taking her seriously at all; if someone says chest pains and you don&#39;t do anything in the standard protocol they are not taking you seriously. On this Monday, 2 days ago she had gone down to pick up the records from the ER to go to Primary Care Physician appointment 27Apr2021, finally actually got to speak to someone who said they would get back to her on 27Apr2021 to look into why the EKG tests were not done for someone having chest pains. That&#39;s one of the first things you do for someone having chest pain, no matter what the source. Frustrated with them because they&#39;re still not communicating back, they had not taken her seriously while she was there; unknown if they were actually going to be reporting, as they were still trying to convince her to get the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. If she reacted to the first dose in first 10 minutes, second dose could be much more of a reaction. With the amount of anti-histamines in her system with Benadryl and Zyrtec and she was still starting to react in under 10 minutes. It&#39;s possible to be one of the inactive ingredients but she doesn&#39;t see anything in the pamphlet provided that she could identify at first glance as being the culprit to the problem other than 2 possibilities: potassium chloride and other is monobasic potassium phosphate. There is a possibility of her having a reaction to those because she was known to react to certain potassium products; sometimes it was the inactive ingredients. She definitely would have wanted to get the second part of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine series until after she was not getting the medical attention she needed after reaction to the first dose. Because ideally you&#39;re supposed to have it at the same location, that just made her very nervous at the prospect of worse reaction at location that did not take her serious the first time. She was a big fan of Pfizer thought they do a great job; she had not known it was a 2 parter, not that it should make much difference. When her Primary Care Physician was saying second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was out of the question and she had been saying to people that she did not think it would be prudent to take the second part, they kept trying to say oh you need to get the second part, talk to so and so so they can convince you to get it, and doctor is going no. She reacted to ringers lactate or lactated ringers whatever the name is, her retired nurse sister sat and watched her getting some ringers lactate prior to surgery for her tear duct and saw her starting to break out in red splotches, patient said she was itching. Action taken in response to the events was drug withdrawn. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 20Apr2021 09:00, at 61 years of age, (Batch/Lot number ER8737) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid disorder from an unknown date and ongoing (she has had it for years), hypertension started about 8 years before this report and ongoing, immunodeficiency from an unknown date and ongoing, her spleen has been removed and she is immune compromised and has had COVID. The patient reported that after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine administered on 30Mar2021 at 09:00, she had mild diarrhea, body aches, fever and headaches and she felt she had COVID. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. In Apr2021 the patient experienced body swelling, assessed as medically significant, swollen joints, ulcers breaking out inside her mouth and a 24 hour migraine headache. Ulcers started about 3 days in from the 2nd dose, they come and go. She keeps them at bay by using Listerine. She understands that whatever is happening in her lower gastrointestinal tract is coming up into her mouth. The patient added she is a neuro-muscular therapist and had an understanding of how her body works. The body swollen started a week after the shot (also reported as immediately after the shot). It continues at the time of the report and it is persisting. The patient stated &#34;she has a little bit of COVID brain&#34;. Moreover, the mild diarrhea after the first dose changed to constant diarrhea after the second dose. It is water and with intense cramping and is constant. She reported she is on the BRAT diet. &#34;It won&#39;t hold so she is living on Gatorade and white rice&#34;. Over the past week, her joints in her hands and in her body have become swollen. Horribly swollen to the point she couldn&#39;t get her pants on because her knees and ankles were so swollen. Her hands last week started swelling and the pores around her joints look like blisters. The patient added she has had severe brain fog since an unknown date which was ongoing at the time of the report. The headache has not left as well, the outcome of all the events was unknown at the time of the report. The patient has not been to the Emergency Department or her Physicians office, but was going at the day of the report.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm; swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm; She got a bruise at the injection site; It bled a little bit when she put it in; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The day of the shot, I was fine.   But I went to bed at about 10:00 that night and slept very little.  I was chilling so badly that I couldn&#39;t get to sleep!  When I got out of bed in the morning, I could barely move due to severe muscle pain.  I did very little all day, suffering from what felt like the flu:  chills, loss of appetite, and &#34;brain fog&#34; such that I couldn&#39;t read or think clearly.  My head felt warm, but I never took my temperature.  The next morning, I noticed hives on my chest between my breasts and around the armpit of my left arm.   The following morning, now  about 45 hours after my second injection, I still had pink hives, and my left armpit was swollen so that it wasn&#39;t concave, as it always is, but convex.  Touching my armpit hurt, and I think some gland in it was swollen.   Similarly,  a gland on the left side of my neck was swollen and painful to the touch.  Today, now  the fourth day since the injection, the hives have subsided, and my glands are almost back to normal.  Overall, I am very glad to have had the opportunity to get the vaccine, but I haven&#39;t felt that sick in years.

Woke up in the middle of night and I could tell I had a &#34;huge lump&#34; in my Lt armpit. The lump is very sore. No redness or hot to touch. I am going to watch it over the next few days. If it gets bigger or red, I will seek medical advise. I am guessing it is a inflammatory reaction to the vaccine and my lymph nodes are inflamed there. No other lymph nodes are swollen any where else.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

I stayed in place until I felt better about 30 minutes. For the rest of that day and the next day I was extremely tired, a little nauseous, and kind of out of it. The third day I had very sore left arm at site and very sore and tender lymph notes on left side of Arm and trunk. Six days after the shot I came suddenly down with a massive headache and diarrhea. Al has since resolved and I am on day eight.

                                                Patient has allergies to several medications and keeps epipen on hand with her always. Was asked to sit for 30  minutes after vaccine. At minute 27 she started getting swelling and redness of her lips and face slightly. She normally takes Benadryl when this happens so gave her a Benadryl 50mg one dose. Her throat then became tight in a few minutes and she said that she needed an epipen because she was starting to have a little bit of trouble breathing. Gave epipen and her symptoms resolved within a few minutes. Kept her for 15 minutes. She stated that she knew she would be ok and asked if she could leave. I stated she needed to see the ER if she had any more trouble. I also consulted with her to check with her doctor about getting the 2nd dose because more than likely it&#39;s not recommended.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after vaccination, patient began feeling bumps on lip and swelling under jaw.  Soon after, she felt flushed with itching in feet and swelling of feet. I observed a mild redness to face and upper chest. I saw no swelling of neck, lips or oral cavity. I ordered 25 mg. benedryl po be administered at 3:10 PM.  A few minutes later, she felt tightness in chest. At that point (3:15 PM) an EMT tried to inject an Epipen but only left the pen in for less than 1/4 second before she withdrew the pen. I then administered another Epipen directly after and the pen was in her thigh for over 3 seconds. The patient was transferred light and sirens to ER. She received no further Epi in the ER and received steroids, benedryl, and famotidine  according to the ER Resident. She was doing well 90 minutes after vaccination per Dr.

This consumer (patient) reported that a 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 62-years, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hadn&#39;t had her period for 8 years. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historically received first single dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 62-years for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine last Friday 19Feb2021, when she was driving home her eyes was runny, sort of hurting like salt in her eye, it was like that all evening she had to put a patch on her eye to help it. That same evening may arm was hurting where she got the vaccine in the right arm, and the lymph node under her arm got inflamed. The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body. Consumer added that she read on line that patients should wait for 5months before going to their doctor about the swollen lymph nodes because they might send the person for a test, mammogram and it may say they have cancer, in the clinical trials apparently some patients has issues with their lymph nodes and when they did testing it was found they had cancer, but it was not cancer it was the vaccine. Outcome of the event she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed was recovered/resolved in Feb2021; of the armpit swelling was not recovered/not resolved; while of remain was unknown.  Information on lot/batch has been requested.

                                                I had arm pain, aches, tired and vomited a few time. I felt weird all over. I had pain in my upper abdomen, legs and lower back. Chills and anxiety. On 2/8, I had a tele visit with my doctor. I took Tylenol as instructed to make sure that I didn&#39;t develop a fever. My doctor said that it could be from the vaccine. My left leg and foot were swollen on 2/13, so I called my doctor again and he sent me for a Doppler to check for a blood clot. I saw him on 2/15 in person. I have lower back pain and weakness in my legs at times, but it doesn&#39;t prevent me from doing anything. They feel heavy, especially if I walk for an extended period of time.

                                                My arm has remained sore since the shot 4 days ago.  Specifically in the armpit but aches all the way down to my hand at time.  My armpit is swollen and painful.  The pain goes thru my underarm down to my hand. The pain makes it difficult to sleep. Tylenol doesn&#39;t take the pain away.  At first I thought the pain was a side effect to  the initial vaccine, but it got worse as time went on.  Finally I researched it on line and saw that lymph nodes have been reported as swelling due to the vaccine.

Medics responded, as we were talking, realized numbness had followed the trigeminal nerve back to the ear, and then from the ear, toward the nose. we determined it was not life threatening, and I was asked to contact my healthcare provider. Left lower quandrant of cheek/face was swollen for between 24 - 36 hours. Developed diarrhea 24 hours after injection.

                                                cellulitis; lymphadenitis; Fever 103; Still swollen from groin area down to knee; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was unknown. Concomitant medications were none. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks or other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced fever 103 white posture on knee that turned into cellulitis and lymphadenitis. The patient had IV antibiotics twice within 5 days of vaccine as treatment for events. The patient still had swollen from groin area down to knee. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event cellulitis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2 based on the information provided. The event onset date is not reported, therefore the drug-event temporal relationship is not clear. In addition, the BNT162B2 vaccine was administered in the arm but the reported cellulitis was at knee area. It is very unlikely that the cellulitis was related to BNT162B2.

The fever and aches only lasted one day with Tylenol.  The lump is still present.

                                                I received the Vaccine around 11:14 a.m.  At around 4:30 my lips started feeling tingling and the roof of my mounth was feeling the same.  I did notice that my lips were swollen and my face was swollen slightly.  I continued to drink fluids.  I did take 50 mg of Benedryl hoping that the tingling and swollen lips would go away.  It took almost three (3) hours for my lips to go down a little.  I did not take anymore Benedryl.  I alerted Pharmacy regarding my symptoms and Dr. via telephone call.  I do not plan to take the second dose.

Reports reaction resolved after one week then recurred one week later with no triggering event or additional vaccine given during that time.

                                                This is not what I would call a side effect but rather an autoimmune reaction. I experienced what I would call pulsing in the lymph nodes, in order left underarm, right underarm, left groin, right groin and my neck, like nothing I have experienced before. It felt like someone was playing Operation and poking and activating them, followed by inflammation of my gastrointestinal system top to bottom with sporadic pains in different areas. I am still recovering a week later. I postponed my second shot until 4/15.

Within 36 hours following vaccine administration, every site of bee stings received over the past 10&#43; years-- on the right side only --swelled or itched or both, as though I had just gotten the same sting in the same location (I am a beekeeper, so had about 10 sites on the right side).  Prior sting sites on the left side did not react. [After the first vaccine dose, these same sites had, at intervals, felt like the &#34;pinch&#34; of the initial sting over the 48 hours following the vaccine] Now, 48 hours post 2nd dose, most of the sites have cleared and the itch has ceased completely.

I had to spit out the saliva, which helped, but it still lingered for a few minutes.    2nd reaction -Day 1 After several hours, I experienced swelling in my right arm, and diarrhea.  I also had insomnia, and slept very little the night of the shot.  Day 2  I had loose stools, slight nauseous feeling most of the day. My body odor smelled like onions.  I also had bad muscle aches and fatigue. That night, I had insomnia again and slight chills.  Day 3 Still had loose stools, fatigue and muscle aches. The onion smell comes and goes.  I experienced excessive urination throughout the day (about once an hour, which is not usual for me).    Day 4 Muscle aches and fatigue are gone,    Day 5 Excessive urination again.  Onion smell comes and goes.

By 3rd day pain noticed in left and right arms, moving across the top half of the back above the shoulder blades.   Excruciating pain by p.m. of the same day preventing me from sleeping.   Unable to use arms to get a glass out of the kitchen cabinet.  Pain has moved around causing pain and swelling in joints, affecting the right and left arms, wrists, hands, legs.  Went to UTC where I was given a steroid shot.  The shot lasted about 24 hrs. and right back to the above symptoms.  Going to physician today hopefully for some lab work.  11 days of pain!

An ambulance was called and I was transferred to Banner University Medical Center.

On March 18th, 2021 I had a spontaneous anaphylactic reaction requiring the use of Benadryl and an inhaler. 40 minutes after second injection (Apr. 2nd, 2021) my face became bright red - which is usually the beginnings of an allergic or non-tolerant reaction to something to which I&#39;ve come in contact.  A Benadryl dose resolved this reaction within 20 minutes. On April 10th I had a spontaneous anaphylactic reaction requiring the use of Benadryl. 12 Days after second dose I noticed my tongue feeling raw and started feeling a UTI beginning.  By 14 days after second dose I had approximately 14 pea sized lumps on the back and back sides of my tongue, the gums of my teeth were very swollen and sore. The roots of my teeth ached terribly, chewing was very difficult.  My ears were both very itchy deep within.  I was seen my my physician on  April 20th, 2021 and diagnosed with Candida Overgrowth.

A 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: FR8737and expiry date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm, on 07Apr2021, as a single dose (at the age of 62-years) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201 and expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, in left upper arm, on 05Mar2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient arm hurt after first dose (began immediately and lasted for about 4 days) which was resolved on 09Mar2021. Patient second dose was scheduled on 27Mar2021, but she did not get it till 07Apr2021. It was reported that on 08Apr2021, patient had such an awful reaction to the second dose of the vaccine. She started to get dizzy and weak, chills, everything was a blur, sweating, could not drink threw up if she tried dry heave went back to sleep and slept for 48 hours had just chills the whole time. She was in bed sleeping trying to drink, getting up to go to the bathroom and feeling like she was going to die for the next three days. She was nauseated and is still nauseated and could not drive. She took Tylenol an antiemetic at urgent care that stopped. She took Zofran with the saline solution infusion and she went home and slept. She was dehydrated and had soreness all over. On 09Apr2021, she could not roll over and had a sore on her left butt cheek that was still there cold sores on lips. She thought the sore on her left butt cheek came from laying in bed so much, and it was not in any other space but that one spot almost like she would have gotten the shot there, but she didn&#39;t. On 10Apr2021, patient felt like she was going to die, and went to urgent care and asked if they could give her fluids. They gave her fluids and Zofran and that helped a lot. This one shocked the hell out her, she thinks it was her gums that started to bleed on 11Apr2021. She had the best oral hygiene and went to the dentist all the time. She was flosses like crazy. She started to drink a ton of water and has not seen it since. She cannot guess what the reason was. On 11Apr2021, she could function a little and had chills again last night and sweating. She did not have a fever. She ate chicken noodle soup water and a little bit of ginger ale. She started to feel better, but not 100% better not even 90%, not even 80%, but was heading towards the right direction. Patient also hasn&#39;t eaten for 5 days after second dose. She experienced cold and hot. She was not complaining at all and she has been sick for days and cannot eat and will throw up but will gain it right back. The dizziness and weakness were subsided. She feels like she is getting beat up but is recovering. Patient thought that vaccine pulled out with a syringe and that&#39;s the problem everyone gets the same dose. Patient&#39;s weight was 136 or 138 lbs. Outcome of the events nauseated after second dose was resolved on 10Apr2021, and dizzy and weak after second dose was resolved on an unknown date in Apr 2021, and for the events chills and sweating it was recovering, and for all other events, it was unknown.

A 62-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6206 and expiry date: was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm left, on 10Mar2021 at 03:30 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at hospital. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID-19, before the vaccination, however, results not provided. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19, after the vaccination. Patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer survivor, chronic lymphatic leukemia. Patient had known allergies with penicillin and sulfa. Concomitant medications included calcium, colecalciferol (D3), macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX), multi vitamin, and ibuprofen (ADVIL DUAL). The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and morphine: and had allergies with both drugs. The patient reported that on 11Mar2021, her heart was fluttering and beating it out of her chest with elevated heart rate which goes up and down. She also felt her heart was racing. It was very erratic. The highest heart rate was 130 (non-sustained). It was started since morning after the vaccination and was still happening now and wanted to know that it was a normal side effect. She had a cardiac work up and couldn&#39;t find anything however, everything was normal. Her heart rate went up to 130, 140, 150 and went to 80. This was happened over a period of 5 or 6 days. She felt like she could not do anything and was lying in bed or on the couch for three days. Her white blood cell count was higher that it should be. She went to her regular doctor who did the EKG, however, results not provided. Further, she went to a Cardiologist and they did another EKG and wore a monitor for a week and did echocardiogram and blood work all results were normal. She was wondering, if this could possibly be a side effect from the vaccine because it did occur in the morning after she got vaccinated. She also reported that she had allergies to medications but not what was in the vaccine and that maybe she had a reaction to the chemicals in the vaccine. She was supposed to get the second shot of vaccine which was scheduled on 31Mar2021 and had concerned about getting the second shot because she had some allergies and now this happened. She was very frightening and thought that she was going to die. It was very scary for her. The product complaint was not reported. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. Outcome of the event Allergy to chemicals was unknown and for all other events it was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

She has weakness, very hard to breath, her face was swelling and her lymph nodes were swollen, and the sodium taste is getting worse and she can&#39;t get it out of her mouth.  Her Meniere&#39;s medicine is not helping at all, and she is not able to drive.  She is really weak and went to the ER twice and they did some chest X-rays that were fine.  They took blood and told her that her sodium was fine, and she feels that was wrong it should be low.  She has a lot of problems with sodium.  The 2nd time she went they did nothing, gave her a nebulous treatment and she could not do that as her throat was swelling up and has had a sore throat since that visit and that breathing treatment.  They told her that it was something like her inhaler, and didn&#39;t give her anything else.  She was then discharged after 3 hours.  She is too weak to walk so is in a wheelchair.  She is dead tired and has extreme weakness, and the salt taste in her mouth is BAD.  The breathing is real bad, and so is the dizziness which is making her Meniere&#39;s bad and all she wants to do is sleep from being so tired.    She has two bad knees and is able to walk, but due to the pain she has been using a wheelchair.  She has an APT on Tuesday with a pulmonary specialist.

She went shopping in the store and noticed that she was short winded when she was leaving, but felt that it was possibly asthma and left.   She had a temperature between 102 and 103 for a couple of days and having fever and chills as well.  She continued with the shortness windedness, and had company and on 5/9/21 they left and she started having severe pain, felt like it was either on the right side kidney or the lung, and was spasming horribly and knocking her down with the pain.  She went to the ER and they did a CAT Scan thinking it was kidney stones, but told her that she had three blood clots in her lungs, lower base right and lower base left and mid right and part of her lung has apparently died due to this.  They put her on blood thinners, Xarelto.   She was admitted on 5/10 early morning and released on 5/12/21.  The doctor in the hospital said that it did not make sense that she had blood clots in her lungs, but nothing in her legs.  She told her that she was short winded, and he told her to report her reaction.  Since being home she has been coughing a lot due to possibly the blood clots.  She was told that she will be on the Xarelto for a very long time.  She was also informed that she had lymph node enlargement as well.

I was fine and was able to return home safe. However, at around 5 pm, I felt a sudden pain on my right leg. My leg felt hot, became red, and had a big lump or swelling which was about 10 cm. The leg was not just feeling hot but was also hard like board. And I could not move my leg. I was really scared, and was thinking of calling an ambulance. Thankfully, everything went back to normal after 5 minutes - no pain, no swelling, no reddish color, and I was able to move my leg. However, after 30 minutes, the same thing happened to my left leg. But the pain was a little weaker and I could still move it despite the pain. The left one was not so bad compared with right one. And a few minutes after, my left leg was fine. Everything was okay like nothing happened. I did not notice any mark on any of my legs.   However, at around 9 pm, I looked at my leg and I noticed a circular trace/mark which was about 10 cm on my right leg. Please see the photo attached.

                                                For the last three days (starting 5/31), I have had enormously swollen feet.  This is very, very unusual for me.  I have only had swollen feet like this after long international flights.    And the level of swelling was not anywhere near as extensive as this. (I have not travelled anywhere since the start of COVID-19.) This &#34;event&#34; started on Monday, 5/31/21. On day 1,  towards the end of the day, I noticed that my left ankle and foot was enormously swollen. There was a clear difference between my left ankle and my right ankle (narrower). And my sandals cut into my foot as they never have. We have a friend who had surgery that removed all her lymph nodes at the top of her leg, so I had seen her lie on her back with her rump against the wall and her feet above her, resting on the wall, to drain out the fluid. So I tried that. I sat against the wall for 1/2 hour to see if the fluids would drain out of my ankles. It helped.  I went to bed thereafter and in the morning both ankles were smaller diameter, with the left ankle still a little larger. On day 2, my left ankle was more of a problem and both ankles were significantly swollen. My left calf was also huge. I sat for most of the evening with my feet elevated and it helped a bit. Today, day 3, I decided to see whether exercise would make a difference. Between meetings (four times today), I walked from the second story of our house to the first floor and back up multiple times (10 times, 5 times, 5 times, 3 times). This did not help. In fact, it is much worse on day 3. At the end of the day today, both ankles were badly swollen, along with both calves. My calves are hard with the impact of the swelling.

Just the injection process alone made me feel ill. So I waited the 15 minutes before I left, until I felt safe to drive. At noon the meds started affecting me, which is what I expected. I&#39;ve continued to experience arm pain, weakness, armpit swelling and tenderness, arm not wanting to work and posturing. This is day four and its just starting to feel like its coming back &#34;online.&#34; Monday I reported to Colleague Health, who advised me to contact my physician, who I consulted via phone this morning. Physician requested I fill out Adverse Event form.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 63-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: ELD14D, via an unspecified route of administration, in left side of arm, on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included early breast cancer from 2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included tamoxifen citrate 20 mg tablet by mouth once daily from 2017 and ongoing for breast cancer (cancer pill, she has to be on it for 5 years). The patient received the vaccine as she is &#34;with fire department, thought she needed to take it, she had early breast cancer, is around lots of people&#34;. On 09Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, assessed as medically significant and in Jan2021 she experienced earache (she thought it was an earache, but it was more than that, but it made her ear hurt, and she has no infection), her mouth was drawled a little, further detailed as numbness and &#34;the eye, it is messing with it, when she is trying to see out of it, she can see, but it&#39;s blurry like&#34; and, &#34;where the ear thing is&#34;, on the back of the lymph node was real sore and her face was kind of puffy, which is the reason she went to the doctor. The patient had to go to her doctor, he told her she had a reaction to the shot, he called it Bell&#39;s Palsy, and said to let Pfizer know. Her doctor gave her something to take for mouth drawled/numbness, which is supposed to help, and she has to go back in a week. The event Bell&#39;s palsy outcome was unknown at the time of the report.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.

Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide, potassium chloride, and calcium citrate (CITRACAL). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Patient stated that a cooler used to transport the covid 19 vaccines had a temperature of 31 to 33 degrees F and she was concerned about the vaccines on the bottom of the shipper that were next to the dry ice in the shipper (date unspecified). Patient wanted temperature excursion data for the covid 19 vaccine and stated in Jan2021 she felt hot at the injection site, swelling, tired, arm pain and had bruising after the first shot because of improper technique (02Jan2021 17:00). Patient reported on the first dose having only arm pain, chills, and tiredness, and headache in Jan2021. Patient also stated that the first dose was much better tolerated. Patient stated some of her pharmacist friends have had the same effects from the vaccine. Patient wanted to verify that the vaccine in the syringe is good for 6 hours and that she read Moderna is effective for 1 year and Pfizer is good for 6 to 12 months. She does not think her vaccination of covid 19 was valid because she thinks the temperature that the pharmacist recorded was not correct. Patient wanted to know if she should get tested to see if the vaccine worked. Patient stated that Pfizer is too complex and has too many pieces and states they need to give more information about how to use the thermal shipper. The patient had Covid test post vaccination as nasal swab on (BioReference COVID-19 Nasopharynx) on 26Jan2021 with results as pending. No treatments received felt hot at the injection site, swelling, tired, arm pain, had bruising after the first shot, chills and headache. The patient did recover from the events felt hot at the injection site, swelling, tired, arm pain, had bruising after the first shot, chills and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

                                                No issues during 15 minute observation period after receiving the vaccine. So I left the facility to go to my car. Then about 15 minutes later my  face started to get really hot with  slight swelling. Then after several more minutes throat became tight and started to experience extreme  difficulty swallowing.   I was still in the parking lot so I immediately went back inside to the vaccination area asking for help.  I did not experience any breathing difficulties during the entire time but did experience extreme difficulty with swallowing and throat tightening.   The staff did the usual  checks. I was not too awarre of all the things they did but I was given a benedryl tablet which I was able to swallow thankfully. I was told my vitals were very high.  Not sure of exact times but sometime shortly after the benedryl things started to fell better.  The throat/swallowing started to get better.  Face burning started to cool.  Stayed in this area for about 20 or 30 more minutes and then told I could go with a comment that I should see my doctor about my high blood pressure.  Which I explained I do not have high blood pressure and when checked later in the day it was back to my usual 115 - 125 range .  I was concerned about getting the second shot later and was told to take a benedryl either just before I get the next shot or right after.??????   After checking the online cdc guidelines that does not jive at all.

                                                The following day after the 2nd vaccine, I felt a small itching on the left side of my neck/shoulder blade. I didn&#39;t scratch but I felt swelling.   After softly rubbing my neck, I felt a little bubble as if there was liquid in the bubble area.  I thought maybe it was a side effect so I waited  a full week.  Along with the itching &amp; swelling, there was a small amount of tender pain.  The swelling still persists.  On the 10th day after the vaccination (March 15th), I saw my doctor.  He felt the same area  sensation of a bubble around my shoulder blade.  So far, there has been no treatment.

After 2 weeks most of the swelling is gone just a slight bit. Headaches have been every day until yesterday.  Went to dr the following Monday after the vaccine as was give some anti inflammatory shots in my neck as not allowed anything ( cortisone) due to vaccine. Taking Tylenol and Advil and using Valteran.  Dr was not sure if from exercise or the vaccine but have been exercising throughout the pandemic. Never had headaches when my neck would bother me only hand tingling and that was not this time.  The acupuncturist today said still a bit swollen and tender and feels that it is a combination of the neck and the vaccine as the vaccine attacked my most vulnerable spot.  I had a massage today to to try to stretch my neck.  Headache is doing better today and I can move my neck more.

I stayed about an hour because I was scared to drive. I later got chills and fever for about 24 hours.  I eventually developed shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, tightness in my throat, bruising in my legs and painful lymph nodes in my neck and arms. One day, I felt like I was having a mini-stroke. It only lasted for a brief period and then went away. That has occurred multiple times. My doctor thinks some of my issues were due to anxiety, but I don&#39;t agree because I&#39;m fine now.

A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Mar2021 as single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure (It&#39;s under control now, fairly healthy; diagnosed probably when she started menopause in early 50s), ongoing Anxiety (Diagnosed probably when she started menopause in early 50s), ongoing Sinus headache (Worst sinuses; Takes Excedrin because Tylenol does not have an effect on her), ongoing smoker (Pack a day, but smoking about only about half of it each time. started when she was a teenager.

Family history included cardiac and heart disease, Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia (husband). Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Taken these for as long as she can remember, they kept advising it, husband takes it for Parkinson&#39;s so she just throws one in for her), calcium ascorbate (VITAMIN C) 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Started at least 2 years ago, doesn&#39;t drink enough orange juice, doesn&#39;t do fruits, doesn&#39;t get enough Vitamin C), linum usitatissimum seed oil (FLAXSEED OIL) 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Started at least 2 years ago, family history of cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative) for cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative, fish oil 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Started at least 2 years ago, family history of cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative) for family history of cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril 20/12.5 mg, once a day, by mouth (She has been taking this medication for years, under control with this medication) for High Blood Pressure, lansoprazole from 2020 30 mg, once a day, by mouth (Started years ago) for Stomach pill for acid reflux, duloxetine hydrochloride 60 mg, once at bedtime, by mouth (Started forever ago) for just being achy and anxiety, lorazepam .05 mg, 1 tablet 3 times a day, takes one tablet a day at bedtime, by mouth for Anxiety (Started this a while back- with the heart disease and everything else, gave this to help with menopause symptoms too), meloxicam 15 mg, at bedtime as needed from 2017 for back issues- really sore at times, takes if really stressed or she overdoes it. Patient previously took Tylenol for sinus headache and does not have an effect on her. After the first dose of the vaccine the patient reported that she was extremely tired on 11Mar2021. She was completely nauseated most of the day on the second day. On Saturday, she was extremely nauseated (12Mar2021) with vomiting and major diarrhea on 13Mar2021. By 4 PM that afternoon (12Mar2021), she could not function because she was so cold; she felt like she was in a really bad dream and couldn&#39;t wake up. She called on 13Mar2021, her blood pressure was so low-they got 58 for the top number, they were unable to pull up bottom number at that point. patient reported that when the ambulance arrived, they described her face as extremely pale on 13Mar2021; her major complaint was that she was so cold- she has never been that cold in her life. When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

At home I fell asleep for an hour or two, swelling started in my legs mostly but also arms and all over.  They were swollen like balloons and it was difficult to bend the knee. Swelling was visable, white, no redness,  Next day my face was swollen and dark bags under my eyes.  I have had this swelling before and another bad episode was after surgery with anesthesia.  It is still very tight and sore mostly in my knees.  Not sure if it is autommune reaction or allergy.

The day after surgery I started experiencing intermittent  palpations for several days before subsiding. March 26 had second injection. 2 1/2 hours after injection started experiencing palpations intermittently throughout the weekend and on the Monday morning became lightheaded and dizzy with an increased heart rate (114) and bursts of rapid palpations, &amp; LLE edema. Unsure if the edema was related to the vaccine or the knee surgery. No lower extremity edema was present 2 days post-op. Sent to ER

                                                On my way home (about 2:45-2:50), I developed tingling in my lips and my ears felt numb.  I pulled into the parking garage at a hospital on my way home and by then my knees felt weak and numb too.   After waiting a while in the hospital my legs began to swell and my pants felt tight from the knee down.   Later the top of my head felt numb but my lips felt better.  They administered 50 mg of Benadryl about 6 pm and my leg swelling went down and I felt good enough to go home by 7pm.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER2613 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration administered in the arm, on 23Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer survivor. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that she was trying to figure out what to do. On 26Mar2021, her arm started to swell a little bit. When she woke up, it woke her up at 5 o&#39;clock in pain and her shoulder was kind of swollen, it has got big old knot and it was red and it was apparent itchy and she could not scratch it so, she thought about it and she got an ice pack, so she put ice on it. She was holding ice on it now, trying to sooth it. She was wondering where she would go for reaction, she knew she had reaction like this before so she had a side effect from it, and her arm was kind of still stiff and sore. She did not go to the emergency or urgent care because she looked at left and she looked at the right and like she said, it was swollen and she got big old knot and it was red. She also stated that she did not take Tylenol today. She did not know what she wanted to get through to somebody and she needed to speak to somebody on what she needed to do. She also said that on an unspecified date in Mar2021, in her stool, she found some blood. She had another appointment with her &#34;thyroid&#34; (not clarified) and she does not know the results yet. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

She states she was in fear of herself. She doesn&#39;t do well with hospitals and being put under with that medicine.

Pre-Diabetic: They have been watching that for a while. Stated she gets edema, swelling in her legs, well, all the time. She has had this the last two years because she is pre-diabetic and a lot of overweight people have that. She also has varicose veins so that doesn&#39;t help.

Just for background, my reaction to the FIRST SHOT was minimal (slight headache) until the 2 WEEK mark (after my checkin) when all of a sudden I had **5 canker sores in my mouth (both cheeks/ NOT cold sores) and also a ** buzzing in my ear.   I received my second shot on 3/26/21 .. minimal reaction except sore arm - until 2 WEEKS exactly (again.. and after check in).   ****Enlarged inguinal lymph node on right side with pain and sleeplessness.   Over an inch... maybe the size of a pecan in its shell??  No sign of infection - as far as I can tell - no urinary burning or pain.  no extra discharge, etc.. no cuts.   also, continued buzzing in ears and sores on tongue and lips - all at the 2 week mark.   FYI, the enlarge lymph node, ear buzzing and multiple canker sores are highly unusual for me!!

A 63-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included leukaemia, seasonal allergy, anaphylactic reaction, drug hypersensitivity. Concomitant medication(s) included fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for hypersensitivity from an unspecified start date and ongoing; dasatinib monohydrate (SPRYCEL, NDC: 0003-0524-11) taken for chronic myeloid leukaemia from 2013 to an unspecified stop date; spironolactone (SPIRONOLACTONE) taken for fluid retention from 2017 to an unspecified stop date; mirabegron (MYRBETRIQ) taken for hypertonic bladder, start and stop date were not reported and unspecified medications for leukemia. The patient previously received Epipen for anaphylactic allergies to foods, drug, and environmental allergies. Caller was calling about the Pfizer BioNtech COVID vaccine. She has had a plethora side effects since her second dose 24Mar2021. It all started with chest wall erythema then it moved to axillary node lymphadenopathy the she got a high fever of 103 and then there was myalgia all across her torso, abdomen, and and upper back, she clarifies her trapezius area. She confirmed on 24Mar2021 the chest wall erythema began that afternoon, 24Mar2021. Axillary node lymphadenopathy began Thursday, she confirms 25Mar2021 ongoing improved. The fever began Wednesday, she confirms 24Mar2021 and it was still ongoing. Yesterday she woke up and it was 103 today it is a bit better, it is 101.2. She confirms today it seems to be improved a bit but yesterday she was taking hand fulls of Ibuprofen to try to get it down. The myalgia she noticed Thursday 25Mar2021 and it was ongoing, it was some what improved. She has environmental allergies. She had some throat tightness the day of the COVID vaccine that dissipated late that afternoon and that was for both doses. She carries an Epipen because she has food, drug, and environmental allergies. She has had anaphylactic allergies to foods. She clarified she was far from needing to use an Epipen with the her doses of the COVID vaccine, the throat tightness just dissipated. She does not think an Epipen would have helped a fever and body aches anyway. She said she takes Spironolactone for fluid retention from the Sprycel. She tried to look up to see if there was any interaction between the vaccine and Sprycel but she couldn&#39;t find any thing. Her husband was in the pharmaceutical industry as well and they have looked up available information of duration of side effects and they couldn&#39;t fine anything and she was just surprised that after 4 days of it she was still waking up with fever and still having myalgia. She was wondering if the agencies had reported or maybe they have not unmasked any data yet of duration of things reported that are listed. It just seemed extremely unusual. Caller reported fever after her second dose of the Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 vaccine. She said yesterday she was taking hand fulls of Ibuprofen to try to get the fever down. Today the fever was a bit better but it was still ongoing. The outcome of the event fever, myalgia were not recovered, chest wall erythema was recovered on 27Mar2021, throat tightness was recovered on an unspecified date and axillary node lymphadenopathy was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

Don&#39;t know if this happened when she got Hashimoto&#39;s, Thyroid, ongoing Vestibular Issues Started 5 years ago. States one doctor thinks it is her bad neck. States when she got old things shifted and changed. One ENT said she has neuritis, where something hit her ear nerve in right ear.

No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). AEs following prior vaccinations: None; reported she hadn&#39;t had any flu vaccines in years because of the ingredients.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto&#39;s - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn&#39;t mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn&#39;t have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn&#39;t walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can&#39;t walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn&#39;t , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven&#39;t had it since. It&#39;s almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could&#39;ve affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn&#39;t know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn&#39;t know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn&#39;t want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can&#39;t explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn&#39;t want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn&#39;t mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn&#39;t really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn&#39;t know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles. All events (AEs) did not require a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office. The events of Tunnel vision, rush of pressure to back of head and the lower part of head, Headache, dizzy/Dizziness/light headed, cloudy and pressure in her ears/Ear Pressure, was recovered on 01Apr2021, of my arm started to really hurt/Sore Arm; sore to touch was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Apr2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as many medical conditions, names unknown, just a combination of medical problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, some of which were taken in the morning. The patient had the vaccine on 02Apr2021 (reported as &#34;Friday or Saturday&#34;) in the afternoon and had a bad adverse reaction to it. The patient had swelling in the face, hives on her back, itching that was in her back, and, allergic reactions on 02Apr2021. Due to these, since she was just in a medical facility, doctor and nurses over there were able to inject her with Benadryl that was a strong dose, in a long needle given into the muscle and stuff. It was good enough that she got up and was sent home. She then seemed to be fine but on Monday, 05Apr2021, she couldn&#39;t get out of the bed as the pain all the way down to her back was killing her, like it was paralyzing her. She could not even get out of the bed for like hours. The neck and back pain on Apr2021 were pretty intense, and she does not know where and how it came so she was trying to figure that out and realized she just recently had the vaccine injection. She knew that there could be some kind of reaction, but she was not sure if it were from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure she did not get something serious because she already has rare conditions. She added she did not have any prior treatment for these because she did not even think like this was even a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine but now she was wondering if it was because she had not taken anything prior. She does not know if it was related or not and she was concerned about it. She wanted to know what she could do if these were side effects because she knew there were some people that have something to do with the spinal cord and she was not sure if their symptoms were like hers or not. She wanted to know if she would need treatment for it and if it was an adverse reaction. She added that the swelling in her face and, itching that was in her back went away the same day when she was given the vaccine. The outcome of the events swelling in the face and itching that was in her back was recovered on 02Apr2021. The outcome of the other remaining events was unknown.

                                                Two days following my shot I awoke with an all over body rash which was very itchy. I took Benedryl, hoping that would settle things down.  It didn?t help. I went to bed that night, and when I awoke the next morning, the rash was even worse and my hands were so swollen I could hardly bend my fingers. The itch was really severe on my hands and feet.  My husband took me to the ER, where I was treated with antihistamines and prednisone.  I was there for about 3 hours and released with a prescription for another 6 days of prednisone.  The rash , swelling and itching began to improve  after about 2 days.  The ER doctor told me I should not get the second shot.

                                                incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp; her lips had started swelling; her tongue was tingling; she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction; she was just tired; type 1 hypersensitivity; a little soreness; It was like heaviness on her chest; having trouble breathing; allergic contact dermatitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a physician. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn&#39;t have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn&#39;t have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn&#39;t even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can&#39;t really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event &#39;she was just tired&#39; was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

Caller confirms she has no NDC, Lot number and expiry date for these medications.

A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 63-year-old) as 1st DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Patient took vaccine as she wanted to fly on an airplane and not worry as heavily. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, patient had diabetes for at least 5 years, ongoing high blood pressure from an unknown date, reporter think patient high blood pressure was more with her weight because patient was obese. Patient was immunocompromised with her diabetes. Patient had no relevant family medical history. Concomitant medication included ongoing metformin (METFORMIN) taken for diabetes mellitus. Patient has been on it for years. Reporter believed she was on the max dose that she thinks was 2000mg, but could be wrong. Patient was not eating or drinking from 03Apr2021 and did throw up. On 06Apr2021 patient was tested positive for Covid and experienced hypoglycemic shock at 11:00, renal failure and Covid fog. Reportedly, patient also experienced viral pneumonia, mobility issues, gets out of breath easily, weak, her blood sugar was 28, covid fog, couldn&#39;t remember anything which wasn&#39;t normal, wbc was elevated and headache. The patient was hospitalized for hypoglycemic shock and COVID-19 from 06Apr2021 to 17Apr2021 (11 days), then discharged and was told by her HCP to wait 8-12 weeks before getting second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine. Patient scheduled to receive second vaccine dose 15May2021. Reporter was told that it was a max of 42 days that patient can get the second dose of the vaccine, but that has obviously since passed. They want patient to come in and get a second first shot. When patient was admitted, the doctor thought patient had viral pneumonia already for at least a week, so it would have started about when she got the shot. Patient was better, she was not on oxygen anymore, but she still gets out of breath easily. Patients mobility issues started when she came down with symptoms. Patient had renal failure and was weak. Patient was not eating or drinking. Patient was diabetic and she had hypoglycemic shock which was what put her in the hospital. Reporter thought it was probably a cold or flu or something and Easter happened where she was not hungry and did throw up. Reporter thought it was something she ate that was bad. When she had the hypoglycemic shock reporter could not wake her and patient was in some kind of unresponsive state from 11:00 to about 15:45. Patient blood sugar was 28 when the paramedics arrived. They were able to get her responsive and transferred her to the hospital. They ended up putting her on a dextrose drip because they could not keep her blood sugar up. They put her on steroids and the number went sky high into the 500s and they could not control it in the hospital. There was a lot of stuff that happened. Reporter did not believe that patient has any lasting effects from the hypoglycemic shock. Patient sugar was back to normal and she was on her normal medications. Patient was off insulin which they gave her in the hospital, so that part was okay. Patient was dealing with Covid fog also. Reporter does not know if it has to do with blood sugar or how the virus attacks the body. Patient had multiple MRIs because they were worried, she had a stroke, and she said she could not remember anything which was not normal. Patient not eating and drinking started right before Easter and was much better. Reporter believed that at about 14Apr2021 or so patient started to eat better and have more of an appetite for food. Patient has recovered completely. The reporter did not notice the Covid fog until her mother was in the hospital on 06Apr2021. She does not remember her first week in the hospital, and then even when she was discharged on 17Apr2021 that whole next week she was still very foggy. The reporter would say she was better now. patient talks normally and was back to swearing which is perfectly her. Patient has recovered completely at this point. Patient mobility was better. Patient was not using the walker in the house today, and her balance was better. It was probably due to some of the side effects of the medicines they added like a beta blocker and other things to make sure she was okay. Regarding kidney failure started, reporter stated on 06Apr2021 patient creatinine was 3.99. Patient also had a high D dimer and were worried about her clotting and throwing a PE or something. That was mostly in the first few days around the 6Apr2021, 7Apr2021, 8Apr2021, 9 Apr2021, 10Apr2021 when they were not sure what was going to happen. The following week patient was still at 5 to 6 liters of oxygen, but by Friday night 16Apr2021 she was down to 1 liter of oxygen. Patient did not come home on oxygen. Reporter believed patient kidneys have recovered, but she did not know. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.47 on an unknown date, 0.97 on Sep2020, reporter does not know if it returned to 0.97, but the last number she knows of was 1.47, 3.99 on 06Apr2021, blood creatinine: 1.47 on 17Apr2021. Patient had normal bloodwork in Sep2020 and her creatinine was 0.97. Reporter did not know if it returned to 0.97, but the last number she knows of was 1.47. That would have been when patient was discharged from the hospital. Blood glucose: 500s on an unknown date in Apr2021, blood glucose: 28 on 06Apr2021. On 06Apr2021 patient was tested positive for Covid. On an unknown date patient got CT, high d dimer, CBC, MRI, metabolic function test, white blood cell count, X-ray and Chem 28. Reportedly, bloodwork were done daily in the hospital, and patient has had bloodwork once since she was discharged. WBC was elevated so they did a blood culture to make sure patient did not have an infection. The culture was negative. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There was no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. There were predisposing factors diabetes and immunosuppression. Patient started Tylenol pill on 06Apr2021 after vaccination at an unknown dose. They gave it to her continuously because she had bad headaches. They started her on antivirals and took her off of Remdesivir because of her kidneys. They put her on a different antiviral that the reporter did not remember the name of and a biologic. Home health just discharged patient, and she was still dealing with viral pneumonia and mobility issues. Patient was still on different medicines and she normally was not. The report is related to study or programme. The outcome of the event hypoglycemic shock was recovered on 06Apr2021 and was not eating or drinking was recovered on 14Apr2021, viral pneumonia, mobility issues, was recovering, renal failure, positive for covid 19, gets out of breath easily, weak, her blood sugar was 28, went sky high into the 500s and they couldn&#39;t control it in the hospital, covid fog, couldn&#39;t remember anything which wasn&#39;t normal, wbc was elevated, throw up and headaches was unknown.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

A 64-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3248) at single dose via an unknown route at right arm on 16Jan2021 about 11:00 for vaccination against Covid. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Medical history included anxiety, high blood pressure, and ongoing physical urticaria (with no investigation assessment) where if she gets warm her arms itch and she breaks out in a little bit of hives, but never to this extent. Concomitant drugs included lisinopril at 20mg, 1 tablet by mouth once daily for high blood pressure, and sertraline at 50mg, 1 tablet by mouth once daily for anxiety, both ongoing. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as &#34;none&#34;. No other vaccines given the same day and none 4 weeks prior. No history of problems with vaccines in past. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine was &#34;none&#34;. No events following prior vaccinations. Family medical history relevant to the event was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Patient reported an adverse event/side effect to the Covid vaccine, and was not sure if she should go ahead with the second dose or not. Patient received the vaccine on 16Jan2021 (reported as Saturday as of 18Jan2021) about 11am and at 5pm she started getting a warm feeling and changed to cooler clothing. Patient started itching and then broke out in hives on her face, arms, and chest. Patient used a cool cloth to face to cool off and sat under the fan. Her daughter got her some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) within that 15minutes and about 20-30 minutes of taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride it was calming down. Patient only took 1 diphenhydramine hydrochloride to help and that took care of it. This was the only occurrence. Her face was really swollen and red, she looked like she was sun burnt, skin was blotchy, but she didn&#39;t have any trouble with breathing or heart palpitations. The event onset date was 16Jan2021. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room/ Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Outcome of the events was resolving.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

They are on upper and lower lip, and one is even immediately below my lip, on my skin that is not mouth mucosa. They are painful .

                                                I had my 2nd dose of covid vaccine on 1/15, around 5 pm.  Next day when I got up about 7:20 I felt dizzy nausea and wanted to vomit.  Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                This 64 year old female experienced an adverse event. At baseline, she presented in a wheelchair. Within 5 minutes after vaccination, she complained of a racing heart, a new onset tremor of hands and head, and slurred/stuttering speech.  She denied chest pain, shortness of breath or itching.  No facial droop or one-sided weakness was observed.  The patient had a history of hypertension and history of an adverse reaction to albuterol in November 2020.   The patient described being nervous to get the vaccine due to her previous reaction to alberterol which had the similar effects as today&#39;s.    The patient&#39;s new tremor worsened, and speech became more slurred and stuttered while we observed her.  The patient denied any pain and described a similar event that caused her to be hospitalized for a week with no definitive diagnosis.  Her primary care doctor had cleared her to get the vaccine.    Her Vitals were as follows: BP 160/90. HR 65, RR 20. Heart sounds were regular with occasional PVC&#39;s. Lung sounds were clear No visible rash on neck, trunk or injection site. Capillary refill was normal.  Mild edema in both lower extremities. No swelling of the lips. No visible droop in facial muscles. Patient was tearful and struggled to speak.  She repeatedly said she was tired.  She reported nausea.  EMT was called and found similar vitals and O2 saturation at 100% on room air by pulse ox.  O2 via nasal canula was begun.  Rhythm strip showed NSR.  Patient refused transport to the hospital for further evaluation.  She was informed of a possible Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) could be occurring which could need a blood thinner and further work up.    Patient was tearful saying her previous hospitalization was traumatic and did not want to return.  EMS offered her transport to another hospital facility via private vehicle, and she refused.  We offered to contact her primary care doctor and she also refused.  She was concerned about the cost of a hospital stay if she signed out AMA.  EMS left the facility and offered to return if the patient changed her mind.  The patient&#39;s symptoms had not resolved by 4:30pm.  The patient&#39;s son, by phone, confirmed she would be monitored until 5pm.   She was driven home by one of our staffers. The next day, the patient told our staffer that she felt well. She said it took about 7 hours for her speech to return. She said her head, stomach and body felt better in the morning. She said she going to see an allergist as her doctor recommended.   Our presumed diagnosis was a TIA related to uncontrolled HTN with anxiety.

We got home and had lunch and then just took it easy the rest of the afternoon.  Around 2pm I took a couple of Tylenol because a headache was forming and my left arm was aching at the injection site.  I also noticed a tenderness in the lymph nodes in my groin.  I slept mostly well.  I did wake up in the middle of the night with the 2 bones in my left foot were throbbing where the screws are.  It feels like anywhere I had severe inflammation or surgery, there were intense feelings of burning pain.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021. States she had real bad pressure in her head and high blood pressure and felt like her heart was skipping beats on unspecified date. States her blood pressure was around 152/100 on 09Mar2021. One-day blood pressure was real low, 88 over something but that kind of went away. States all that information was already reported. The next week, she thought she was feeling better and that Monday and Tuesday felt back to normal. Stated that on Thursday night (Mar2021), she was just sitting and around 8 o&#39;clock her blood pressure spiked within a few minutes to around 184/105 and she wasn&#39;t doing anything; she couldn&#39;t get it to go down. States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor. Stated she was on a really low dose of blood pressure medication, stating that she had occasional problems with her blood pressure in the past but it never went that high. Her blood pressure was usually in the 140&#39;s or 150&#39;s over 90 something. States that now it is much higher and happening every night. Caller stated that Wednesday night (24Mar2021) her blood pressure started to spike every 5 to 6 hours, stating it first started at 830 at night and again at 230 in the morning. She has been feeling unwell since that shot. Her doctor thinks it may be causing inflammation. States that they doubled her medication last night and her blood pressure is still going up and up, but usually goes down after a couple of hours. It is totally uncontrolled and her doctors are trying to figure it out. States that meds have been added, including Xanax and will be going to see a heart doctor. States that this has all been since the vaccine. Caller would like to know if people are reporting these symptoms. States that it is pretty terrible, and that she feels normal and then it rushes over her. States that it is exhausting and that she almost went to the ER last night. States that she does not want to go back if she does not have to. When she filed the first report she did not have issues with blood pressure yet. Again, she had the vaccine on Monday 08Mar2021 and that the next Thursday she felt like her heart rate was really high. During that first week, she felt out of rhythm, like missing beats. Her blood pressure dropped low the first week and that just one time was around 152/100 but it didn&#39;t sustain. It then dropped pretty low one day. The next Thursday, it was uncontrollable. It was around 180 over 104 or 105 and that it kept going up, but then back down to 160/90 something. Took Xanax and went to bed, when she woke up this morning it was low, but went right back up within 5 minutes. In the first couple of days, they increased her blood pressure medicine and it seemed to be bringing her blood pressure down and she was able to go to bed. The caller stated that Monday, it will be three weeks. States that a day and a half after the vaccine, her arm was not hurting but was still puffy, but not bad. States that when she runs her hands over it, it is still sore to the touch and a little swollen but nothing extreme. She was concerned that her blood pressure keeps going up and then down. States that the blood pressure started spiking on the 18Mar2021, in the evening very quickly and was very high. Stated that this was happening every night since then until the 24th, when it started spiking every 5-6 hours; and her blood pressure medicine wasn&#39;t controlling it like it was earlier in the week, even though the dose was doubled. For one day it worked good and brought it down low but then, it wasn&#39;t controlling it anymore. She stated no relevant tests, related to this event but states that in her last 2 labs her cholesterol was high. States that it was over 300 and her bad cholesterol double or more triple. States this has been going on for many years. States that she changed her calcium to calcium with vitamin D and her vitamin has come back up. When she was in the ER they did a Metabolic panel and everything looked okay. The adverse events require and emergency room visit. The patient recovered from the event lump in throat on 10Mar2021; the events arm swelled up and was sore recovered in Mar2021; the events erratic heart rate, chest was tight, was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days, wheezing resolved on unspecified date.

                                                I have had three adverse events from the second COVID vaccine. 1- After the first vaccination I experienced an exacerbation of my Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (reported previously). It subsided in the interim between shots. After my second shot I have another exacerbation of my Complex Regional Pain Syndrome with burning at sites where I have had CRPS in the past.  2- Left arm from shoulder to elbow swollen shortly after the time of 2nd vaccination.  It has remained swollen 3 weeks after vaccination.  Last Thursday April 1st  I received my maintenance dose of my allergy shot one in my left arm and one in my right arm.  At the time of the shot I experienced excessive pain in my entire left arm  different than with prior shots. My left arm swelled up even more.  It is now 2&#34; larger than my right arm.  There is still pain and swelling  in the left arm but range of motion is intact.  Saw the allergist today.  Only thing to do is to take an NSAID at this point.    3- joints in my left hand fingers are swollen.  They were not swollen prior to the second vaccination.  Rings on my left hand ring finger that were loose prior to 2nd vaccination are now tight.

                                                She got her vaccine and after she received it she was okay, after 10 minutes she had a heated sensation to her neck, and chest and radiated down her right arm to her finger.  Her legs from the knees down went numb.  She had waves of this that would come and go.  Then her upper lip got numb decided to leave as feeling it may have been anxiety.  On her way home in the car she had these reactions again and called her husband and told him that something was not right and that she felt weird.  She talked herself out of going to the ER, and went home.  She still was feeling really weird to be ok that came and went.  She called her friend who is a nurse who told her to take Ibuprofen and to go to bed.  She felt better after about 2 hours, and seemed to be doing okay periodically until the day before yesterday when she started feeling numbness in her legs, arms and then her upper lip which was pretty severe.   The heat from the arm is burning and burns to her upper chest and neck.  Yesterday morning she could hardly feel her feet saw a report of somebody getting Guillain Barre from it.  She took an Aleeve PM to go to sleep.  She woke up yesterday morning and the muscle pain was go but the numbness was still there.   She called the CDC who told her to contact us and to get in touch with her PCP and she was seen by her yesterday who ruled out Guillain Barre.  She examined her and said that her that the glands are swollen and relays the reaction to the injection and that may be causing the neurological numbness in her arms and legs.  She put her on a 5 day steroid to see if that helps to alleviate her symptoms.   She does feel better today but still having some numbness in the arms and legs, and swelling in her glands.

Moving head and neck were very uncomfortable - extremely stiff.  Same location of inflammation as the first shot. Both vaccine shots were given to my left arm - which had no pain. I have a very high pain tolerance.. This pain required me to tap the Norco which I had from two hip replacement surgeries - which I never needed! Same with C sections or broken (hairline fractured) bones.

Septic arthritis vs. reactive arthritis vs. other -  64 y.o. female with a history of Crohn&#39;s complicated by multiple small-bowel obstructions requiring bowel resection and lysis of adhesions, chronic hyponatremia, hemochromatosis, iron deficiency anemia. She presented to the emergency department with acute left knee and wrist pain.   # Knee Pain # Wrist Pain Acute, progressive polyarthritis in the setting of recently receiving her 1st COVID vaccine.  Imaging revealed small diffusion in the left knee with concerns for septic arthritis.  Arthrocentesis with WBC count 35,000, no organisms or crystals.  Labs significant for leukocytosis and elevated CRP and ESR. Pain has progressed to involve multiple joints particularly on the left side.  Given polyarticular involvement, reactive arthritis secondary to immunization verses Crohn&#39;s disease seems likely, although cannot definitively rule out septic arthritis at this time. Plan: o Monitor off antibiotics for now o Follow blood and fluid cultures o Trend ESR, CRP o Orthopedic surgery following o Pain control with tylenol, oxycodone o Consider GI consult if picture appears consistent with Crohn&#39;s related arthropathy   # Acute on Chronic Hypo-osmolar Hyponatremia Sodium 125, baseline appears to be 125-130.  Thought to be SIADH based on past endocrinology evaluation. Plan: o Check serum, urine osm, TSH, cortisol o BMP daily o 2 L fluid restriction o Hold home spironolactone  #  Left knee and wrist pain with swelling.  Likely secondary to reactive arthritis as a side effect of 1st COVID vaccine on 04/13/2021.

Some tenderness in left upper arm.  About a week later (April 1) I had left upper back  &amp; chest pain  (just left of thoracic spine area and forward to left of my sternum bone &amp; left shoulder pain). The area of discomfort increased to under my left armpit. I used Tylenol every 4 hours but still had some pain.  The pain was bad enough that I had trouble sleeping  at night and reaching for objects in my home.  I noticed an &#34;engorged&#34; feeling &amp; tenderness in my left breast.  Swollen lymph nodes were present under my left arm - breast was too tender to check for more lymph nodes.  No fever.  Wasn&#39;t sure if I should go to an ER so checked the internet &amp; 4/14/21 Contacted &amp; consulted with my family doctor (Dr - My Chart messages) to let her know.  Found information on Web (internet) that some women are having this kind of reaction in lymph nodes so was less worried about something more serious like a heart attack).  Afternoon of 4/15 and today 4/16 feel the symptoms are beginning to go away - pain in my axilla area is better, lymph nodes not as hard &amp; tender,  left  breast and left side of backbone have decreased discomfort.

A 64-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6208), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 64 years old), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing thyroid (disorder) (Unspecified thyroid condition). It is the vaccines with aluminum and bovine extract that she knows that she can&#39;t handle. Caller reported that she got a flu vaccine at work and that she definitely got the flu within a few minutes of receiving the flu vaccine.  Caller reported that another time after receiving the flu vaccine, she definitely got the flu but she was unsure of the time frame.  Caller reported that she did have the flu vaccine several times but that two times, the flu vaccine definitely gave her the flu.  She has 3 brothers and that one of her brothers that she is a  caregiver for has Type 1 Diabetes. Her brother just felt like he had to have 2 vaccines several years ago and that he received the pneumonia and flu vaccines. Her brother was hospitalized within days of receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines.  Her brother was placed in the ICU for heart patients and the medical staff at the hospital was not sure if her brother was going to live. She couldn&#39;t remember how long her brother was hospitalized for, caller stated she thinks maybe around 10 days.She knows what she knows, her 2 other brothers were also hospitalized as children. She didn&#39;t know if her brothers had vaccines  before they were hospitalized but that she would bet money that vaccines they had received are what resulted in hospitalization.When hospitalized, her second brother was not expected to live. At the time of the event, her brother was only 1 or 2 years old. Her brother&#39;s infection was so bad that the hospital sent blood to the CDC and that the CDC couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with her brother.The hospital kept giving IV antibiotics to her brother and he lived. Her third brother hospitalized around 5 years old with pneumonia during the summer. She didn&#39;t know if her brother had received any vaccinations at that time. She just thinks the vaccines did that to them but she doesn&#39;t know that.  Someone gave her first brother the information on the pneumonia and flu vaccines he received prior to his hospitalization. She didn&#39;t have information regarding the details of the vaccines that her brother received.The facility where her first brother was vaccinated with flu and pneumonia vaccines would not give her the information on the vaccines that her brother received.  Caller reported that it was a really hard time to fight the facility for that information and she was shocked the facility wouldn&#39;t give her the requested information.  Caller reported that they wouldn&#39;t give her any medication records or anything.  Caller reported that it was a bad time for her to fight it, and that she will eventually go back and tell them they have to give her the information.Her brother that she is a caregiver for and that was hospitalized after receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines also had the Covid-19 vaccine on 16Mar2021.  Caller reported that she had been more concerned about her brother having a reaction as he has serious health issues, including Type 1 Diabetes and a heart condition.  Caller reported that her brother stated that he&#39;s fine and to the caller, her brother seems fine. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. Patient has experienced that the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made her hypersensitive to light on 20Mar2021. She is losing vision on Mar2021 because of the hypersensitivity to light. On 20Mar2021, patient had a lot of dizziness and nausea. It is effecting all of her organs. She has had headaches, chest pain. The Covid-19 vaccine is affecting all of her organs. Yesterday, 30Mar2021, her lymph nodes were hurting a lot, at least she thinks it was her lymph nodes. All of her organs that have been affected by  the Covid-19 vaccine and that it seems like it moves day to day. She is mostly sensitive to UV light  but is also sensitive to artificial light. She thinks that the hypersensitivity to light has improved a little  bit but it&#39;s still a problem. The hypersensitivity to light was the absolute worst on 20Mar2021. She doesn&#39;t know how much she is still dizzy when asked if it was still ongoing. She added she has been taking Benadryl and ginger for the dizziness and nausea and it helps a lot.She has been taking ginger for the nausea, and if she still has a little, it&#39;s not as much.Today is an overcast day and that it&#39;s an easy day for her.  Caller reported that  bright, sunny days are the worst.She was unsure of when the vision loss occurred but stated that she knew by 20Mar2021 that she had lost vision. She didn&#39;t know if she was continuing to lose vision but she can tell she lost vision. She did have a headache in the evening on 16Mar2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. She thinks the headache occurred in the evening on 16Mar2021.She may have had some headaches between 16Mar2021 and 20Mar2021, but that the headache she had on 20Mar2021 was a horrible headache.She is still getting headaches.  She would say the headaches are a little better but she is still having them.She is having headaches that she doesn&#39;t think she would normally have.  She wasn&#39;t having headaches before receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.She thinks she did have headaches between 16Mar2021 and 20Mar2021, but 20Mar2021 is when the headaches really hit her.The chest pain is intermittent and that the chest pain coincides with when the light is affecting her.  When it&#39;s UV light, more so in the afternoon on sunny days, but technically the artificial light in the evening some days bothers her too.She doesn&#39;t think her lymph nodes were bothering her before 29Mar2021. Her lymph nodes are ok this morning, 31Mar2021.Different organs have hurt at different times. The effect on organs started within minutes of  getting the Covid-19 vaccine.She could feel her eyes and that her eyes felt different within minutes of getting the Covid-19 vaccine. It felt like the Covid-19 vaccine was hydrating her eyes on 16Mar2021 but at the time it felt good. Afterward she was freaking out because she was concerned about her eyes.In the evening of 16Mar2021, it seemed like there was a film on her eyes and she had a headache.On 17Mar2021, 18Mar2021, and 19Mar 2021 she had headaches that she wouldn&#39;t have normally had.On 20Mar2021 different organs started hurting.Her biggest concern was the chest pain. After looking back on it, the chest pain may have started between 17Mar2021 and 19Mar2021 also.The effect on her organs from the Covid-19 vaccine occurs on different organs at different times on different days. The effect today isn&#39;t bad because it overcast outside and that her organs are really affected when she is exposed to a lot of light.She had 2 blood tests yesterday at her primary care doctor. The doctor ordered labs for VEGF and Leptin. She doesn&#39;t get vaccines.No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event Photophobia, Nausea, Headache, Lymph node disorder was recovering; other events was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

The next day, she noticed a bump on her hairline by her lymph node with pain radiating to under her jaw.  A few days late she reported a fever, red eye, and increased blood pressure. She went to the emergency room and ended up being admitted and checked for a heart attack or blockage. The cardiologist who cared for her said she did not have a heart attack. He could not conclude that the symptoms were a result from the vaccine, but advised her against getting the second dose out of an abundance of caution.

First Pfizer shot on 4/9, on 4/18 I had an anaphylactic shock reaction to eating a banana.  I&#39;ve never had a food allergy  in my life.  Had all the symptoms of anaphylaxis except for hives and my throat closing up.  It was quite scary and very painful.  I did not call an ambulance or go to the hospital.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away. The pain was passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area at one point went away but she still have nausea and diarrhea and they gave her more fluids and sent her home. They didn&#39;t really want to address the vaginal bleeding. Patient have not been back and was not sure if she is still dehydrated. Patient was still pushing fluids and still not back to normal. Patient&#39;s daughter told her that since it was 5 days later it was not a reaction. Patient was thinking maybe it was an allergic internal severe reaction. Patient was weighing 130 pounds but lost about 4 pounds during this illness, so 4 pounds lighter. She stated her daughter-in-law was doing research and found a blog and there are woman the caller&#39;s age complaining of these symptoms (unexplained bleeding) after the vaccine. She asked if this was from the vaccine. She stated she was so sick that if there is even a chance then she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She asked if this is a coincidence or has it been reported. She stated she is trying to make a decision on if she should get the second dose because she heard other people have symptoms and take the second shot. The outcome of the events passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area, headache, a sharp pain in her side, passing blood in her urine, passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area/vaginal bleeding was recovered on Apr2021, while for the other events, it was unknown.

My husband and I had already figured out the name of the condition.  I took that information with me to the doctor on 5/25/21.  Today (5/27/21), I met a former nurse who immediately recognized the syndrome.   She said it was seen rarely.  Seeing my finger gave her goosebumps! Severe pain in fingers as blood vessel pops (sharp burning, stinging, tingling).  Fingers swells and lose mobility, movement is severely limited/restricted.  Usage of the finger aggravates the problem and causes it to last longer. Condition persists in varying degrees for at least 3 days.  This happened to my right index finger 5 times since the onset.  Each time it seems to be worse.  It also happened to my left index fingers but it was less severe and shorter lasting.

Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Vaccine was not Administered at any Facility. No History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Caller wanted to know about the need for booster dose; Was it going to be like the first or second dose of the vaccine. Caller wanted to know the ingredient of the Pfizer covid vaccine. She said she took both of the doses and had a bad reactions from it. Caller stated she had a lot of issues with the first dose but not as bad as second dose. The second dose almost killed her and affected her brain and speech. She had the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, and experienced a bad reaction after both doses. Caller asking what was in the vaccine that could cause her bad reaction. She never had a reaction to any vaccine. She had allergies and autoimmune disorder. Her arm was so sore/ sore left arm the first time. It was difficult to get in and out of car for 3 weeks, but she recovered completely. She helps the handicap people, so she had it put in her left hip/ sore left hip. It was sore for about 2 weeks, but she recovered completely. Caller added she needed to decipher what was written on the vaccination card.  She wished they would write better. She used her glasses. Caller took no pharmaceuticals, just Benadryl for allergies when need. The Hospital where she received her vaccine was used and created by another facility, but not a an offsite facility. But for them to use also. Caller added she was cured of everything she had from the Therapy. After the second dose: She started same day as vaccine on 08Apr2021. She did her protocol that time, and as far as breathing and that, it was not like the first dose, but towards the evening she had an auto immune response that lasted for 3 weeks. She felt like she experienced mild sepsis and gained 10 pounds overnight of fluid. Her kidneys, bladder, intestines, stomach and she felt swollen and her liver too. When this happened it started with feeling puffy that evening and lasted for 3 weeks. Caller added if she was exposed to a virus, or had an allergic reaction this happens. Caller added even her lymph nodes got huge and thyroid felt swollen, felt like she had a tourniquet around her neck. That lasted for 3 weeks. It was bad the 1st week. That caused a severe headache that started on the 3rd day and lasted 4 days. It was really bad on the 1st day and she wanted to go to the Emergency Room. She took Benadryl and Ibuprofen, and a Doctor told her she shouldn&#39;t take Ibuprofen because of Covid. She was allergic to Tylenol and Aspirin, basically any pain killer, Percocet and Darvocet, Everything except Ibuprofen. Caller did not have the bottle to provide details. She usually put Ibuprofen in her Benadryl bottle for her inflammation. That was the only thing that she took. She took Turmeric and fish oil and several other supplements. Her headache peaked on the 4th day, and she took the Ibuprofen and was better the next day. Throat swelling started on the 5th day and lasted and was still causing her difficulty pronouncing words. Her tongue felt swollen. Her cognitive issues started the 4th day of her headache and was intense. It continued, but was much, much better. She did her normal protocol, and had gotten by, but it was not normal. Her organs felt swollen and the doctor did a test. It was normal, except her bladder, because it was so swollen she felt like she couldn&#39;t empty it completely. The muscles did not work right and she got an bladder infection and received antibiotics, about 2 weeks after the injection, because her bladder wasn&#39;t working right. Urine test: infection. Intense stomach ache: started at the time her headache stated after 3 days along with the headache and ended with her doing the Therapy. They lasted for 4 weeks. Pain in all her organs: started the 3rd day after the second dose. The pain started, she felt swelling and it lasted for 3 weeks, actually, for 4 weeks, the pain in the part of her liver by her stomach. She experienced a personality change and she wouldn&#39;t have the vaccine again. She couldn&#39;t remember where she put things, started on the 7th day after her second dose and lasted until the Therapy made her feel better. Finally, after 4 weeks, she recovered completely and was pretty much back normal now. Caller added she was a happy person and was with her Cancer. People asked how she did it. But with this experience she literally wanted to hurt someone or kill herself, and no it was not normal. She was so cranky. She was sure it was the swelling in her brain. With her food allergies she got swelling, intense depression, suicidal tendencies, and a fight or flight response.  She wanted to leave her life, it was scary. Caller added she did not feel like this now. For the Vaccine Indication: Caller added that people that need it most, didn&#39;t want it.  Because of her autoimmune disorder, she was a long huller and she had died 6 times, so she was willing to try it and take it and deal with the side effects. She was hoping it would not cause any. Her boyfriend died at Christmas. After 24 hours he was dead. He had a mild sepsis from a virus. He has Autoimmune disease. If she got Covid, she didn&#39;t want to end up like him and see her arms and legs amputated. Caller asked if anyone else had reported symptoms she had experienced. Caller asked to clarify details of her symptoms of suicide and killing and hurting others. Caller denied she was experiencing this at time of call. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events headache, Personality change, couldn&#39;t remember where she put things, bladder infection.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included echocardiogram normal: normal  on unknown date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bronchitis , heart rate high.  The clinical course was reported as follows: Caller received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 09 MAR 2021. Caller states the past couple of months she has experienced a lot of adverse events. Caller states she has had issues with bronchitis and went to a pulmonologists and cardiologists and she has been put on 27 different medications. Caller states after all of these things going on she is not sure if she should receive the second dose. Caller states one doctor told her she should not receive the second dose and one doctor told her she should. Caller would like to know if she should receive the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Caller states her doctor doesn&#39;t want to tell her what to do because she thinks he is afraid that she might sue him. Caller thought that by calling Pfizer she would get some advice but she is getting nowhere. Caller would like to know if she can receive the Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine as her second dose instead of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine? Had the vaccine 9Mar2021 and is just recovering now. Last week, she was finally feeling like herself. She had some medical conditions that put her at risk. She is 65 and is afraid to get the second shot but is also afraid to not get the second shot. Her doctor thinks it is too coincidental that this happened right after the vaccine. Has been talking to a lot of doctors. Is afraid to get the second vaccination. So now, she is just trying to figure it out. It really knocked her out, she has had 27 medications, she&#39;s been to the ER 3 times, been to the doctor 7 times, it just really knocked her out, they first thought it was a heart condition, then a lung condition. Has been having rashes and all kinds of stuff. Is afraid to not get the second dose. One of her doctors recommended the Johnson &amp; Johnson, but is that safe, no. Weight was about 200 pounds. Started 5 days after the vaccine. Fever: On Sunday, started to get a fever. It was on and off all day. She thought it was a normal reaction and didn&#39;t think much of it. It was weird. It would be like 20 minutes and then fine, and would be off an on all day. It was a low grade fever, never more than 100. she felt hot and cold all day. It was most of Sunday and stopped in the evening. Treatment: none. Swelling and pain under breasts, under armpits and in lymph nodes: Started Monday. Breasts were tender as well as if like she was having a period. There was pain underneath her arm and in the lymph nodes. Lasted for 2 days. Treatment was none. Felt like bronchitis: On Tuesday, it started to get what she thought was bronchitis. She has a propensity to get bronchitis. She hasn&#39;t gotten sick  in 2 years. She immediately went to the doctor. This went on for 2 months. Treatment: They prescribed Prednisone, nebulizers and antibiotics which she finished everything 3 weeks ago. She couldn&#39;t sleep and had to sleep sitting up, she couldn&#39;t lay down, it started right away when she felt she had the bronchitis. Rash up and down and all over her arms: She then developed a reaction and had a rash up and down her arms, all over her arms. Felt the bronchitis symptoms right away. It was the weirdest thing and she couldn&#39;t lay down. Every time she would get up, she couldn&#39;t breathe. Went to the emergency room 3 times but was not admitted.  At one point, she had a rash all over her body. Her doctor thought it was MRSA. This happened a month into all of this. She got the vaccine 8 or 9 Mar 2021. This rash occurred some time in mid April. When it started, the rash was everywhere in her body. It was so severe, that they thought it was MRSA. Gave her another bout of antibiotics. She had sores that were opening all over her body. She then went to the Emergency room and they treated her there. The other time she went to the emergency room because she couldn&#39;t breathe. She had to sit in a Lazy boy chair for 2 months. The pulmonologist and the heart doctor couldn&#39;t find anything. When they though it was bronchitis, they treated her for 2 months with Prednisone. She got Candida&#39;s from the Prednisone. They put her on 27 medications total. The pulmonologist said it was not the lungs, it was the heart. She was put on medication to slow down the heart rate. It had been running about 119. The medication she was put on was Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. It slows down the heart rate, it has been so high. She was put on the medication 23 Apr 2021. It went so high. Her oxygen has been good. Her heart rate was never slowing down. She is still taking the Metoprolol, her rate is running like 118 and 108, it never slows down. The pulmonologist said it was not the lungs, its the heart and she is going to see him tomorrow for a follow up echo. She is so sick from so many medicines. Is still experiencing a lot of tiredness. It is the weirdest and is very strange. When she was laying down and couldn&#39;t breathe, the doctor said they felt like she was going into heart failure. The Echo didn&#39;t find anything wrong. It was a weird thing.  She talked to both of the doctors, the pulmonologist and the family doctor who said that it was too coincidental that it was from the Pfizer. The Echo was a week and a half ago. The family doctor read it sand it looked normal. The pulmonologist who ordered the test is going to check it tomorrow. Her family doctor said to not get the second shot. The other doctor said she could probably take it. She doesn&#39;t feel like herself. She is scared. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Event bronchitis like symptoms required a visit to Emergency Room for 3 times and Physician Office and has been to the family doctor at least 5 times. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) but had the flu shot in the fall. AE following prior vaccinations was none. Relevant Tests was none or Unknown. Caller states that she is overweight. Caller states that she is trying to get out of here to go to a doctors appointment. Caller states that she has the bottle, she will ask her spouse to read it since she can see better, the product is Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. On the bottle it also described the pill as Round white tablet 51:M18. Caller needs to obtain a magnifying glass. Caller states that she wants to give enough information to what happen to her. She states that the Manufacture is Mylan.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

I began to have an adverse reaction on Friday, 18Dec2020 at 11 PM and then until the Saturday, 19Dec2020 until after dinner I had (Incomplete sentence). You want me to break it down like what the time and what the affect was? Okay 11 PM on Friday 18th my hands swelled up, they were red and they were itchy. I couldn&#39;t get the itching to stop. Hand cream or cold water they finally subsided with cold water and I was able to get sleep. Then I woke up Saturday, 19Dec2020 at 6 AM then was my hands, my feet swollen, red and itchy. Itching was just like, I did not know what to do about it. Used cold water and that rested for about 4 hours. After that stopped I had a rash on my arms, my leg and my abdomen and it just came out of nowhere. It was red like a bubbly rash like a size of pea. You think I looked at I thought what I was going to do. I went I got a cool shower another 4 hours that subsided not completely but enough where it wasn&#39;t scary anymore, it was bearable. Closer to dinner time I had Lymphadenopathy under both arms, red, swollen then I took another 4 to 5 hours to subside. During this I have sore arm that was slightly swollen. The arm was swollen, the shoulder was swollen and the clavicle area was also swollen and that&#39;s my reaction. I work in healthcare and I was just at a point I went to work, I reported the incident and I filed a VARIS report. I talked to my administrator she said I should call Pfizer, let them know. I spoke to my primary doctor, to let him know. I just wanted to report this to someone.&#34;Registered Nurse stated, &#34;My work place.

This consumer reported similar events in two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number and expiry date: not reported), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. Concomitant medication included vitamins nos. It was reported that both the patient and her husband received the Pfizer Vaccine on 10Jan2021; and they had reaction to it. They both both had bad arm swelling and pain. Her was worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm. At first, they just thought it was a reaction as they read reactions could be and then she started to get small cough but by Friday, her husband went and got tested and on Wednesday he was tested positive and this is after the vaccine and then he got the results and it said he was positive. So, Saturday, they both went and got tested, they did the rapid and they did what they call the PCR, and they both came positive for both of them and this was after they receive the first vaccine. So, she thought they need to know that they got sick and it was after the vaccine. The patient needed to ask a question as they were supposed to go for their second vaccine on 31Jan2021 and do they do it even though they got sick. They knew they were claiming that they can&#39;t get sick because of the vaccine but it&#39;s very ironic that they did get this. They had been following CBC guidelines, both her husband and the patient because they are older and they wear mask all the time and they did everything they needed to and they could not understand how they got this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Rapid and PCR: positive in Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;bad arm swelling and pain; worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm&#34; which included treatment with Tylenol. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Injection site very sore; arm swollen; Feverish; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 10:15 (at the age of 65-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFIB), shellfish allergy, allergy to pain medications, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and COVID-19.

                                                About 1/2 hour of the vaccination, I felt mild tingling of the lips.  Very gradually, that got worse (over the nest few hours) and I had tingling of hands and feet.  I gradually developed facial swelling (my lips were enlarged and felt firm, as did my nose).  I checked my pulse ox, and it remained above 97%.  I never had rash or trouble breathing.  But  about 5 hours after receiving the immunization, I took some Benadryl, and over about 1/2 hour I could feel that things were improving.  Over the next 24 hours I took Benadryl again two times, due to return of the tingling sensation of my lips.  I also felt very cold, and had a hard time getting warm.  This also improved with the Benadryl.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

Experienced myalgia  and severe migraine-like headache with light sensitivity. The arm pain from shoulder to mid-palm was so severe that I couldn?t lift my arm. This resolved by approximately noon on 02/10/2021. The other symptoms largely resolved by midday 02/11/2021 wit residual low-grade headache, dizziness, and unsteadiness on my feet.  I woke up on 02/11/2021 around 7AM with left axillary lymphadenopathy approximately the size of a tennis ball cut in half with associated moderate discomfort. The discomfort resolved by 02/14/2021, but the lymphadenopathy remains at about half the mass noticed originally.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) solution for injection intramuscular in the right arm on 22Dec2020 at 08:30 (at the age of 65-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included A-fib (atrial fibrillation), GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and osteoporosis. Concomitant medications included atenolol, calcium, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), famotidine (PEPCID) and omeprazole. Past drug history included known allergies: fexofenadine (ALLEGRA) and codeine. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. On 26Dec2020, day 4 after injection, the patient experienced heat sensitivity in hands and feet, followed by tingling in hands &gt; feet, with sharp burning needles sensation up arms and legs. Heat sensitivity continued. Tips of fingers and toes were numb and felt swollen for several days, while neuropathy continued. Hands then started peeling, palms became thickened and rough. For the events neuropathy, heat sensitivity in hands and feet, tingling in hands/feet, burning needles sensation, tips of fingers and toes were numb and felt swollen, and hands then started peeling an emergency room visit and physician office visit was required. Unspecified treatment was provided for the events neuropathy, heat sensitivity in hands and feet, tingling in hands/feet, burning needles sensation, tips of fingers and toes were numb and felt swollen, and hands then started peeling. The outcome of the events neuropathy, heat sensitivity in hands and feet, tingling in hands/feet, burning needles sensation, tips of fingers and toes were numb and felt swollen, and hands then started peeling was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Nasal Swab on 13Jan2021 was negative and on 19Jan2021 was negative.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information is limited and does not allow a full medical assessment. Considering temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of neuropath, cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                On February 11, 2 days after my vaccination, I woke up with pain and swelling under my left eye.  Over the next 2 days, the left side of my face under the eye experienced redness and swelling then subsided and localized into a large stye on the lower left eyelid.  Now,  a week later, the stye is still red and pus filled but has improved and is slowly resolving.   I would not normally think that this affliction had anything to do with getting a vaccine but it does seem strange that something like this could occur in someone who is very healthy and and does not experience any side effects from vaccines.   The last time I had a stye was in my 20&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as the one I am now experiencing.   Since the Covid vaccine is so new and however unrelated this coincidental affliction seems, I thought I should report it regardless.

                                                Severe to VERY severe continuous  lymph node/breast pain on shot side 1/27 through 2/4. Starting 2/4 intensity started to vary i.e  no pain  during hot shower but still severe pain majority of time. Slight reduction breast pain as spread to back pain and movement seems to help. On night of 2/3 spread to back ? shot side line of nodes paralleling spine  and shoulder/neck area-  back pain not as severe as original breast area and heat helps to reduce back pain Pain interferes with sleep - 2/4 finally able to get 4 hours sleep ( hot shower temporary relief while showering)( normal is 7 hrs) As of 2/5 still in moderate to severe breast area pain almost continuously. Hope I am recovering but its 10 days and still mostly constant incapacitating pain. Very slight intermittent node pain by Feb 17 when got second shot in other arm per Physician Assistant?s recommendation. So far after 51 hours 2nd shot adverse effects minimal and does not interfere with thinking or sleeping

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.  It has not itched, but she has felt it.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                On February 23 (1 week after 2nd vaccine), I experienced sudden onset of swollen lymph node in left side of neck and sore throat, headache, difficulty swallowing, fatigue, some sinus symptoms and stuffy ears. Today is February 26 and I am still experiencing the same symptoms, somewhat less intense than initially.  I called my primary care doctor&#39;s office and was told by the receptionist that this was a reaction to the vaccine and should subside in a few days and if not to call back.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

Was sent to Urgent Care office where I got EKG, which showed no problems with my heart. Went home, weak.  Woke at 2:00 am with night sweats. When I got up I noticed swelling on face, throat, hands &amp; feet. Faint pink rash ran up both fore arms and I had welts rising on my wrists. Nurse line I called said to to to ER asap, Took me a few hours to find a ride, my throat was closing up more by that point. I could tell over a few hours that my throat was swelling up. Went to nearest ER where I was very mentally confused. They  gave me a shot of steroids and Benedryl.  Later that night I got chills and was VERY weak. Had night sweats again. After a few days of rest, am still weak.

                                                No side effects were experienced until 2 days after I received the vaccine.  Two days after I received the vaccine I experienced enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of my back. I experienced pain when I pressed on my back. The pain felt like sore muscles so I used a heating pad which did not alleviate the issue. The enlarged lymph nodes continued to increase to include pain from my left arm pit down my left arm to my forearm and shoulder blade. It also increased down my back into my left buttock and upper thigh. As of today, March 16, 2021 at 3pm, the pain has slightly decreased.

                                                Started with severe headache, moved to base of skull and neck. Next day (Thurs. 3/18) extreme pain in neck, chest and shoulder area, headache, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, brain fog, malaise. I thought it would pass. Friday I felt no better - by evening I felt swelling in my neck and chest area. Noticeable swelling in clavicle area on both sides. Saturday &amp; Sunday I rode it out until I could see my Dr. on Monday March 22. Dr. gave me a shot of steroids and a script for MethylPREDNISolone - 21 tablets. Today is Tuesday, March 23, 2021 and I feel much, much better. Dr. said to NOT get the 2nd shot and to report this reaction.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 07Mar2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy history to a of number of medication and things (I&#39;m prone to allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 07Mar2021, the patient received the first dose and she went to sit in the observation area for 5 minutes. The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose. The patient was asking for information about 2nd dose being given after 42 days. The patient stated that she has not had any more of those symptoms at all. The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

                                                On  March 19 around 8 pm my lymph nodes under my arm started swelling and were very painful. They stayed like that for for 3 days before starting to go down.. The injection hurt when it was given. The  first dose given in my left arm did not hurt 2/22/202. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled a little, but never caused  pain.  I had a mammogram on 3/18 and a place on my left breast/ lymph node has shown that it  could be malignant , but I have to go for more tests to check it out. I have since read about this happening after the Covid 19  vaccine.  The nurses at hospital said to report things like this since the vaccine is still so new, to help know what is happening. So that?s why wam. Thank you!

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half. Confirmed she was not admitted just in the Emergency Room. On 04Mar202 the patient was at the hospital and was gasping for breath. The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her. On 10Mar2021 she was starting to feel a little bit better as regarded anaphylactic reaction, she has recovered with residual effects from the anaphylactic reaction.

Patient asked if there was a conclusion about the PEG and her anaphylactic reaction. Her second dose was scheduled on 25Mar2021. Patient stated that her PCP and the CDC recommend to not get the second dose. Caller wanted to know if the anaphylaxis could be worse in the second dose. The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life. Patient wanted to know if she can get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine after a certain amount of time after receiving the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, caller cannot get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine due to a reaction. As of 12Mar2021 patent stated she does not wish to be contacted any further.   A Product Complaint was filed.

                                                12/29/2020 vaccination About 2 weeks later, I woke up with both of my hands and wrists hurting .It was to the point where I could barely hold a pen in my hand. No swelling nor redness. It went away after 1-2 days. It came back a couple of days later; more predominantly in my right hand. I would take 600 mg Ibuprofen. The following week, it came back and lasted longer then a day; redness and swelling R hand. I called my Dr. She ordered all this lab work; came back Neg. Meloxicam It went away on R wrist. Came back on my left knee; went away. Then had pain in my L hand joints; no outside welling nor redness. I took the Meloxicam again. I didn&#39;t notify the Dr of the knee pain as my lab work was all negative.  The symptoms were for 2-3 weeks. I only too the Meloxicam until pain subsided; not continuous.

In the days that followed, the left side of my face, especially my cheek felt like I had razor burn. My left eye became dry, but that went away, as did scalp itching. I began to produce more saliva on the left side of mouth. My face felt heavy, my upper jaw at times aching, but mostly my lower jaw. The inside of my left ear hurt occasionally along with upper jaw pain. My left lymph node became swollen, as did the left side of my face.  My doctor on Zoom said these were symptoms of Bell&#39;s Palsy, though I did not have the characteristic drooping eye or mouth of Bell&#39;s Palsy. My symptoms have abated, but persist five weeks after administration of the shot.

She went to sleep at around 11:00 AM, and got up around 7:00 and as soon as she woke up she could feel the lump under her arm.  It was a little smaller than a baseball, soft, cystic like.  I couldn&#39;t put her arm down, had to keep her hand on the hip due to this.  The following day the left breast started to feel funny and hurting, but cannot feel a lump but it feels swollen and went up into the shoulder and neck.  She cannot turn her neck as if she has a crick in it.  She had a headache for a couple of days on and off, and then it goes away.  She has taken the arthritis Tylenol.  She has called her doctor and told her to take the Tylenol as needed.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6198, NDC number: 59267100001, Expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 65-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed about 40 years ago in 1981. Concomitant medications included budesonide, formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT) taken for asthma had for a number of years, keeps them on hand; and salbutamol sulfate (VENTOLIN CR) taken for asthma, had for a number of years. The patient got the first shot and she have asthma but forgot to tell them that she has asthma and no one asked her first. The patient got pretty sick on unspecified date and she is trying to figure out if this could be from the vaccine. On 06Mar2021, her lymph nodes in her throat swelled up and her throat was raw, painful, super red and she could hardly talk, it also created a lot of congestion in chest- the lobes. The swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. She wound up going to the doctor and they prescribed her an antibiotic which cleared the infection in her throat. Her symptoms started two days after she received the shot. She is supposed to get the second shot on Thursday 25Mar2021 and that&#39;s why she is calling to find out information on what other people reported as far as asthma patients. She is debating on getting the second shot. Initially caller states that for the most part, it cleared up and went away about three days ago, but then explains it is gradually getting better. Every once in a while, her throat feels dry and raw, but she drinks water and it feels better. At first, she did not want to really talk. She has asthma, the congestion never really goes away and it didn&#39;t really improve this time after prednisone like it usually does. She did not feel good on Friday, but on Saturday it got bad. Her side effects have improved from what they were then. The patient recovered from the event swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. The outcome of got pretty sick and throat feels dry was unknown and the outcome of the remaining events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Cold sores developed on March 29 and lasted for more than one week, despite having a shingles vaccination. On April 10, a likely shingles symptom occurred with pain below the right ear, and eventually spreading to the chest along one side of the neck only. It was accompanied by a severe headache and small fever.

My face was swollen, burning sensation, red, itchy.  Hives appeared on my face, chest.  I was dizzy and had a fast heartbeat.  I took an antihistamine and within an hour or so I was better.   I did not have an anaphylactic reaction as I normally would have if I ate any shellfish.   4/11/21 at 6:30 pm my face started to itch again, and have a burning sensation, eyelids itchy.  I took my daily antihistamine and there was some improvement.  I have some of the itch and burning sensation today 4/12 at 10:30 am.  But not as bad as before.

Over those 7 days, the swelling diminished until it disappeared. Mild pain was present when the swelling first appeared. After four days, there was pain only when the lymph nodes were pressed.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration right arm on 11Mar2021 at 12:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer surgery From: 2020 and Lumpectomy for early stage, completed radiation also, no chemotherapy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received dTAP, TDap, flu and pneumonia vaccinations. She did not administer additional vaccine on same date of Pfizer vaccine. The patient experienced from my leg all the way up to my groin that looked like an indentation on both legs and indentation all the way up from ankle vein all the way up to groin on 15MAR2021 and it was at the lymph drainage area cause it come from a vein in 2021. The patient states it was a few days after when she was exercising as she always does since she is a Marine. From her ankle all the way up her leg, both legs, she noticed a line of indentation in her skin. States she went to the doctor because she was worried and it looked odd. It was a symmetrical indentation line on either side. States the doctor said they had never seen anything like it before. States that she is 65 years old, her husband also went with her and got the vaccine as well. Further states that she is reluctant. She saw two doctors. Indentation was from the vein by the ankle all the way up. After three hours of exercise it was not there. States she is going to exercise and was told to monitor the area and take pictures of it. States she has not yet exercised today. The area was not red, states one doctor said that the area is where the lymph node draining system is located. States she may not get her second Covid Vaccine because she has been reading about it, had this trigger, and no one knows what it is. States that she considers this to be a vaccine but more to be gene therapy. States it seems like overkill. Further clarifies that the indentations on her legs were on both legs from ankle vein to the top of leg/groin area. States it was about one sixteenth of an inch line that occurred after exercise. She notes that she doesn&#39;t know if it was there before, she never noticed it since it isn&#39;t red. States currently the indentation has gone away. Concerned with it recurring. States that it was there after exercise and was fading away after about 2 hours. States that after about 4 hours it could not be seen too much at all. Since September she has gotten the dTAP, then states TDap, flu, and pneumonia vaccinations. States she knows her lymph system effected after the breast cancer and has soreness in her arms. She was curious about why she would have any issues with legs. States she tried to get the vaccine at a physician office but was unable to do so. The reported classified the events to be non-serious. The outcome of the event from my leg all the way up to my groin that looked like an indentation on both legs and indentation all the way up from ankle vein all the way up to groin was recovered and was unknown for the event it was at the lymph drainage area cause it come from a vein.

                                                I wish to inform you that I had a very severe allergic reaction after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I had a dreadful swelling on my face with totally red skin and burning in my face. At first, I did not relate it to the vaccine but thought it was something very rare. I went to my dermatologist and she gave me a number of remedies, including cortisone and other medications. The swelling went down a bit and I received the second dose of the vaccine. At that point the allergic reaction was much more severe, just like the first time but much stronger. I went to an allergist and he confirmed that it was a reaction to the vaccine. It is an extremely rare case because I know many people who have received the same vaccine and no one has had anything happen to them.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 12:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), at the age of 65-years-old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to Sulfa. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included calcium; magnesium; colecalciferol, menadione (VITAMIN K&#43;D); glutathione; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Within 45 mins (also reported as 20-25 minutes) of receiving the shot, she began to feel her left cheek tingle. In the intervening days, her left forehead, cheek, side of lip and chin felt like she had razor burn. Her head itched. Her left eye felt dry, but that went away. She began to salivate more than usual from the left side of her mouth. The left side of her face began to feel heavy, sometimes also my sinuses, but more often my lower jaw. Sometimes, she would feel pain in her left ear. Her lymph nodes on the left side of my face became swollen. Her doctor on Zoom said it sounded like a form of Bell&#39;s Palsy (medically significant), though she does not have the drooping eye or mouth. She had an MRI of her left lymph node that did not reveal any issues. Her symptoms, while they have abated, are still present five weeks after the shot. The events started on 26Feb2021 13:30. No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event left eye felt dry was recovered while other events was not recovered.

Neuropathy in the feet, pre-vaccine included only the toes and balls of the soles, bilaterally; shortly post-vaccine the entire soles were involved.     The evening of the vaccine, it was noted that tinnitus was worse than prior to the vaccine,  (not sure when started, as noise levels were high enough to make that unclear.  That evening, when listening for tree frogs, it was noted that they could no longer be heard, although husband had no problems hearing them.   Neuropathy has improved, but is not back to pre-vaccine baseline.  Increased tinnitus and loss of ability to hear tree frogs continues.

He was treated according to sepsis protocol including antibiotics for bacterial infection for pulmonary infiltrates however it was felt the pulmonary infiltrates are more related with COVID-19 pulmonary findings. Eliquis was started for DVT. Medical Center had been contacted Dr was the pulmonary attending and discussion is documented below- Attending hospitalist spoke to Dr from Medical Center.  At this point they know that she has Wegener&#39;s granulomatosis involving her kidneys and causing her renal failure but they do not think that is what is going on in her lungs.  They have still trying to work-up her infiltrates.  She has it we obtain a nocturnal oximetry study.  She was reassured that the patient is on her normal oxygen rate despite the DVT in her leg.  She feels this should rule out a pulmonary embolism.  If the patient is doing well from cardiopulmonary standpoint tomorrow she should be able to go home on Eliquis and follow-up with the specialist.   She was continued on Monistat cream for 3 nights total.   At this point patient will not require antibiotics will continue on Decadron and may be discharged to follow-up with her specialist.

Swelling went away 1-2  days later.   Hasn?t returned.  Little worried due to having had breast cancer- rt breast.  Just thought you should be aware.  Haven?t had any arm pain in June- yet.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- EW0178, Expiration date: Aug2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 30May2021 as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, osteoarthritis, pre-diabetic, increased cholesterol, barrett&#39;s oesophagus, hyporthyroid. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine at 25 microgram, pantoprazole once a day for Barrett&#39;s esophagus, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) at 5 mg for increased cholesterol. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 09May2021 in left deltoid as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Registered nurse stated, So, I recently had the second Covid-19 shot and I wanted to report something that I went through within 24 hours and last 2 days. I had the second shot on 30May2021 and aside from the headache which did not surprised me within 24 hours I had a horrible pain in my armpit and it swell up like not like node like the whole area was swollen like part of my mammary gland it&#39;s like from the middle of the armpit unto the breast. I took that back the middle of the armpit not quite to the breast but I mean the whole area was raised, swollen and last two days cause vaccinated on Sunday I started noticing it early morning Sunday happened to be in the middle of the night and then it lasted all through Monday and Tuesday and finally started going away Wednesday and today right now it&#39;s back to normal at first I did not think much of it but then I realized that I mean I never have that happened before and that was of the same left arm where I got the Covid shot but it did not hurt from the deltoid around to the arm pit. It just hurt where I got the shot which I expected and then exclusive to the armpit so I did not know if that something was on record so that is why I was reporting. When probed for mailing address, registered nurse started, I was not sure what you were asking okay its (Withheld) okay I was just wondering why you wanted my physical street name. Okay but I did not get any mail at (Withheld) so that&#39;s not gonna help you at all my mailing address was (Withheld) let&#39;s start again my mailing address was (Withheld). Registered nurse stated, date of adverse event started, Well I guess in the middle night that would be 31st Monday the 31st Memorial day. (Clarified as 31may2021). When probed for facility&#39;s Zip-code: Registered nurse stated, I did not know would it be on the Pfizer card maybe are you gonna ask me like LOT numbers or whatever I should go get the card let me grab the card okay let me see I guess I could look it up let&#39;s see (Withheld). When probed for facility&#39;s email address, registered nurse stated, &#34;I did not know email let me see if they had that I did not know if I can find there email. When confirmed the vaccine as Pfizer Covid vaccine, registered nurse stated, &#34;I am yeah, can I ask a question from you real quick you said you were a pharmacist correct so I was wondering you know it&#39;s a multi dose vial and I am a nurse so I don&#39;t really like multi dose vial so the first time I went in there I asked them for the first shot for the vial and the next time I went in there it was a different nurse practitioner she had all the stuff already drawn up which I really like so you know I know I was administering stuff have given like lots of shots over 40 year career if you don&#39;t turn it upside and look around the last dose of the vial could be more potent could it not. Registered nurse was informed about the role of Pfizer medical Information. When probed about the date of first shot, patient stated, First shot was on 09May2021. (Consumed as 09may2021). Patient stated, I did not know what that is NDC and UPC. I did not have any of the code on this card that&#39;s all on there I gave you the EW code and of course the first dose has the different code.: Patient stated, anatomical site of the administration was left deltoid. I had them both on the left deltoid obviously not on the exact same spot but. Patient further stated, I can not think of any other reason I mean it was just too coincidental yes. I mean it was given 24 hours of receiving end and it went away within 2 days later so yeah I would yes say I would so. When probed about other medical conditions, Patient stated, Well I can not say I am suffering from anything but I do have a history of asthma cause its not you know I was not even taking medicines for it. It&#39;s not an issue so I would say asthma I do have a history of asthma and osteomyelitis in my knees I mean not Osteomyelitis, Osteoarthritis in my knees. I am Prediabetic. I had got you know increased cholesterol and hyporthyroid. I was taking thyroid medicine and cholesterol medicine and pantoprazole for very minimal Barrett&#39;s esophagus problem. Patient stated, No I was not taking any asthma controller drug you know what I did use inhaler but when was it you know what I had not used inhaler within that time period at all. So, I would say nothing for asthma. I forget the Venlafaxine, Effexor I take it extended release which like 150, once a day. Patient stated No, but I did take Tylenol (Treatment)that day 1000 mg cause my arms hurt pretty good yeah I took Tylenol that day specifically. Still experiencing these events, registered nurse stated, &#34;I was up until this morning like it&#39;s slowly getting better and like right now it&#39;s fine it actually fine today. I would say like 3 O&#39; clock on the morning on to the 31st then the first and second and a little bit yesterday. It is completely gone now as of today. Patient confirmed outcome as improved. Patient further stated, No just Acetaminophen 1000 mg I only took, actually I took it twice within 6 hours of each other. The reported mentioned causality as related for all the reported events with respect to Covid 19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

                                                Swelling in face at temples where I had filler a year ago; right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Illness at vaccine included urinary tract infection from Jan2021 and ongoing. Medical history included face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection from 04Jan2021 to 11Jan2021. The patient had historically gotten shingles vaccine, flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine and never had any problems. The patient experienced swelling in face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019) and right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed on 10Jan2020 17:00. This consumer had the bnt162b2 on 10Jan2021 at about 12:30pm. On 10Jan2021 around 4:00 pm (reported as &#34;10Jan2020 05:00 pm&#34;) she noticed the areas around her temples and under eyes where she had filler placed last year swelled up quite a bit. She read up on this and saw to take antihistamines or oral steroids for this, so she took antihistamines and the event improved, was much better through during the day yesterday (11Jan2021). Last night (11Jan2021) her right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; in response to that event she has been icing the area and the event has improved, swelling come down quite a bit but still ongoing. She called her primary care physician about this event and is waiting for a callback from them about getting a steroid pack. She already reported this information on an unknown Pfizer website online, and also on the VAERS reporting online site today (12Jan2021); but does not have any reference numbers from those reports to provide at this time. She called to ask for information on how to proceed regarding this event; if this has been reported with bnt162b2; if there would be problems with her getting the second dose of bnt162b2 as scheduled on 31Jan2021 because she heard the second dose would be worse. She also noted during this report that she was still taking nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection when she received that first dose of bnt162b2; she asked if that could have any correlation with event or be a problem taken together. She reported by the time she got that first dose the urinary tract infection itself was gone. Caller verified that she received no other vaccines on the date of first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she had not received any other vaccines in the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she has no history of any adverse events with any other vaccines. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

                                                I had breast cancer in 2003 and had to have a left breast removed and half of the lymph nodes were removed. Due to the surgery I developed lymphedema and i have to wear a compression sleeve and glove seven days a week.  A few minutes after the injection i was reading the reaction list and caught that it might cause lymph nodes to swell and about the time i was reading it i felt pressure in left arm i looked at it my arm and hand swelled  to the point my hand and fingers turned blue i started to massage my arm and called the nurse she told to keep massaging after 30 minutes sitting there the arm was still swelled the nurse released me and told me if it got worse go to the emergency room. I came home kept massaging and elevated my arm about the time i went to bed around 9:00pm the swelling came down. The arm was normal when i woke up

A couple of days later, the pain continued over to my right side also and same difficulty getting a deep breath. For awhile, the pain was in my right armpit too. Put warm compresses on areas and it helped a bit. My sister looked up info on the internet and found that ?Aleve? might help the pain, which it did. Called the  doctor?s office and they were not very helpful. The information my sister got from the internet was of more help. The difficulty getting a deep breath lasted 2 weeks.

                                                Morning after 1st shot awoke with sore back and neck. Appeared swollen like inflammatory response to shot as day of shot felt fine. I did go to Physical Therapy that morning for knee but didn&#39;t do anything out of the ordinary since had been doing that for weeks.  That night was in so much pain couldn&#39;t get into bed. Pain  radiated from back to hip to thigh, and down shin, with no feeling in shin. Muscles very tight and was very odd. Seen by provider the next day and received Toradol shot. That did not provide relief so went to local ER. X-rays revealed pinched nerve. Now maybe that was because of the  inflammatory  response or pure dumb luck. Still in lot pain and will receive cortisone shot next week 10 days after 2nd dose today.  Providers feel not related, but one provider said if my back was inflamed even a simple reaching for glass in cupboard could pinch nerve. I was not going to report but then saw someone posted on (social media) had muscle pain and spasms which sounded like what I had. I believe my inflammatory response to shot drove me to the pinched nerve situation. Been in pain for weeks and had to go to 2nd shot in wheelchair.

The pain moved from left to right in the throat. Also and worse: swollen mouth tissue and gums: agonizing. Lymph nodes in neck very sensitive to touch.  *****This was strange because at the beginning of the pandemic, I had these same symptoms three times: March 10, March 22, and April 28. I had a Covid test after 3rd time and it was negative. Consulted with doc, could not go to office for swab of throat because might be Covid. Had Covid test, negative. Started Amoxicillin for one week. Am feeling better.

Some of the swelling went down during the night but came back the following day.  The swelling continued without any improvement and I started wearing compression socks on the 5th. day. (3-18)  I should have started sooner but I was hoping the swelling would go away on its home.  I have had some minor swelling in both feet at various times in the past 3 months due to some minor sprains and also because of limited movement due to my back injury.  The compression socks help keep the swelling down and I do not know how long I will need to use them.

                                                Today at about 11: 30 AM, I took an Amoxicillin for gingival irritation. I have taken this medicine before , but this was the first time since getting my Covid Vaccine. About one hour later, I began having intense itching of both hands, followed by diffuse flushing and pruritus and slight swelling around my face and eyes and a little feeling of throat irritation, but without SOB, wheezing or tongue swelling. My vital signs stayed stable, including a normal oximeter reading.  I took a 180 mg  Fexofenidine and used some OTC Hydrocortisone Cream on my hands when the first symptoms started. When the other symptoms progressed , I took 24 mg Methylprednisolone oral tablets and 25 mg liquid Diphenhydramine and my husband drove me to the ER, to be close in case I developed difficulty breathing.  After about 30 minutes the symptoms stopped worsening and gradually resolved. I didn&#39;t go to ER

                                                Got dose one on 3/6 and saw Dr. on 3/8 re: reactions. She thought swollen lymph nodes were causing the pain in my thighs which began the night of 3/6. I also mentioned I&#39;d started getting &#34;a cold&#34; which she said could be a reaction. Leg pain subsided by 3/10, but the &#34;cold&#34; worsened that week into a full blown deep cough, fatigue, runny nose, but no fever. Sometime around 3/11-3/14 I noticed I was dealing with tinnitus in my left ear (my &#34;good&#34; ear, not the one with Meniere&#39;s) and suspected it was from the vaccine, as I&#39;d not had this before. Cold subsided by 3/26 but tinnitus got worse, with both a high pitch and a bass, pulsating sound. The tinnitus keeps me awake at night.

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Feb2021 (received at the age of 66-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold sores, 2 knee surgeries, and ADD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) from an unspecified date and ongoing (diagnosed at 30-years-old). Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and other regular medication. The patient received first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and developed numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye on 26Feb2021.  It felt like she had received a lidocaine injection.  Her doctor said this can happen with RNA vaccines, affect the 7th cranial nerve and develop Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She was prescribed Valacyclovir 1mg and has taken it for 3 days.  She wants to know what the other Bell&#39;s Palsy cases were like. She wants to know what their treatments were. Her doctor said it was okay to receive her second dose at 8am on 20Mar2021 but she wants to do her due diligence and see if there is a case report or study on these patients that developed this side effect. The patient further explained that she had her first dose on 26Feb2021 and was she was there for the 15 minutes for observation. On her way home, the right side of her mouth and the right side of her nostril were numb like Novocaine that you get at the dentist. She said that the numbness traveled up the right side of her jaw to her ear and then over to her right eye. When she got home, she told her daughter and she said that she thought it was because she volunteered all day and was worn out and anxious (26Feb2021). She said that she slammed water and ate crackers and after about a 1.5 hours she started to feel better. She said that she then she called her physician and the doctor told her that it was flaring the nerve root like bells palsy and that it is a RNA Virus. She said that she was placed on some medication for it, but was wondering if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She said that the doctor asked her if she had previously had cold sores and she said yes. The caller said that her doctor said that it is exactly what that is. The patient stated that she was also short of breath on an unspecified date, but thought it was from fear and anxiousness. She does not know if it was from fear and anxiety or from the vaccine. She said that the doctor told her to take the medication 3 days before and 3 days after her second dose. She clarified that the doctor put her on Valacyclovir HCl 1Gm tablets 1 a day. She said that she broke out with fever blisters on 02Mar2021. She really did not think anything of it until speaking with friends in the medical field and they told her to follow up with this. She added that the fever blisters are healing and only a tiny bit left. It is at the scab and end of healing. Outcome of numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye was recovered on 26Feb2021. Outcome of fever blisters was recovering. Outcome of other events was unknown.

The patient had no additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Medical history included ongoing seizures from 1982 (began shortly after she had the surgery for her brain aneurysm (in 1982 to 1982). The patient had not had any seizure activity for 20 years before the seizures that occurred on 13Mar2021. Sometimes electrical activity in the brain hits the metal clamp used to treat the brain aneurysm and that triggers the seizures); migraines (suffered from migraines when she was younger but hasn&#39;t had one in umpteen years. The patient gets tension headaches like most people but not very often); shingles (patient had shingles three times. Patient&#39;s first case of shingles was in the early 1990&#39;s and that patient had recurrences in the mid 1990&#39;s and the early 2000&#39;s. The first incidence was the worst and that the second and third occurrences weren&#39;t nearly as bad as the first); blood pressure high; ongoing cholesterol; ongoing headache (tension headaches) and was adopted. Family history included migraines with grandkids, a couple of them had migraines and had MRI&#39;s she&#39;d had a sister that was 6 years older than her that had died of a brain aneurysm.

The patient had the Pfizer vaccine first shot on Friday (12Mar2021). The husband stated his wife (patient) had a possible side effect to the vaccine shot and was concerned with getting the second dose of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine. She had 2 seizures the next morning after the shot (on 13Mar2021) which she hasn&#39;t had in 20 years. The patient experienced her first seizure about 11:00 on 13Mar2021. It took the patient about 45 minutes to come out of the first one completely, until she was conscious again. The second seizure occurred about 13:00 on 13Mar2021, about an hour and a half after the patient recovered from the first seizure. fter the second seizure, the fire department was called and she was transported to the Emergency Room. The doctor told the husband that it was up to them if they wanted to receive the second dose. The husband stated, &#34;I know there is something out there that I heard about where you can disqualify yourself from getting the vaccine for medical reasons.&#34; Also on 13Mar2021, the patient&#39;s tongue hurts in the Emergency Room, no one was willing to give her a new tongue after she bit it.

The patient seemed to be fine since Saturday. he patient&#39;s father was really persistent about them getting the Covid-19 vaccinations. A CT scan and blood work were performed while she was in the Emergency Room on 13Mar2021 and reported that everything was fine. The patient went to the emergency room on 13Mar2021 and physician office on 17Mar2021 as a result of the seizure activity on 13Mar2021. On 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 130/82 with blood work with result of everything was fine. The patient went to her physician on 17Mar2021 due to concern about getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. When asked about prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient stated that she didn&#39;t want to get the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine because she&#39;s never even had the flu shot. The patient stated that back in 1977 when they first came out with the flu shot, she was unable to receive the vaccine as she was pregnant and she has never gotten the flu. The patient reported that she was unable to get MRIs due to the metal clamp in her. Patient reported that the clamp in her head was metal, not surgical metal, and that she has to be very careful because getting an MRI could kill her. The patient reported that next the day (in Mar2021) her arm was so hot that she could have roasted a weenie over her arm and it was very swollen. The patient reported that she went to urgent care and was told that it was an allergic reaction. The patient also reported that she got shingles again after receiving the vaccination. The husband considered the case as non-serious. The patient recovered from seizure with associated disease recurrence on 13Mar2021; for tongue pain was recovering while for the remaining events was unknown.

But after 10 days a swollen lymph node started on the right side of the neck with some fever.  After take Ibuprofen the pain as well as the fever was subdued.  All blood work were normal.  So I stopped ibuprofen. But after 3 days the fever came back high (102)  and so is the pain of the lymph node. Doctor gave me Azithromycin 500mg a day and ordered more blood work. The fever continued to be 102 at the night and around 99 during the day when i drink a lot of water. After the new bloodwork and Neck Ultrasound came out my doctor&#39;s diagnose was: Acute Thyroiditis.

                                                at about 4 hours after vaccine I thought I was having a stroke. The right side of my face went numb and felt like it was drooping, my right arm went numb, my right leg and foot went numb. But I could still talk and make a smile face so I did not go to ER. Gradually both of my legs became very weak and then my hands became very weak. This lasted for over a week/ten days. By the first night I couldn&#39;t sleep because my brain could not seem to get into a deep sleep pattern, had body aches and sore arm but not dreadful, and by the next day had a fever which maxed at 101 degrees ( my normal is 97.2-97.4). Had a low grade fever for 10 days! Also by the 2nd day I had swollen glands in my right neck and armpit, and pain from my  right elbow to my neck. My usual level of unstable balance was MUCH worse for at least a week and my usual tinnitus was MUCH louder than usual for about 10 days! Night 3 I had a very bad episode of something like restless leg which also extended not just in my legs but also into my head! Very bizarre! By day 4 I was having episodes of near fainting, often. This lasted for about another week. All in all it was a dreadful experience, which I believe was related to issues with my already compromised nervous system due to the Parkinson&#39;s/MSA. I will NEVER have another one fetes vaccines or booster shots if those become available. I am quite frightened that the next vaccine could result in me actually having a stroke or other serious consequence.

I proceeded to get a 3- day hot flash followed by intense swelling that went up the left side of my neck to the back of my head. It also inflamed my lymph nodes above my left clavicle. It made it hard to swallow on the left side of my throat. All this lasted for about 6 days. I received my second shot on 4-6-21 at RPCC, Pfizer Er 8737, left upper arm. My symptoms were worse. The sustained hot flash was now accompanied by constant chills, nausea and loss of appetite. The swelling was extremely intense, again up the side of my neck to the back of my head, and my lymph nodes were very swollen in my neck and above my left clavicle. It was very hard to swallow. This lasted about 11 days.  My major concern is that the lymph nodes that were swollen have reduced in size to very hard lumps that you can see just by looking at them. One is about the size of a marble, the other is larger than a walnut. Both are VERY HARD. Their size is not reducing and I can still feel something funny in the left side of my throat when I swallow. I am normally very healthy. In 15 years I may have had 1 small cold, and I have never had a headache. I have no family doctor.  PLEASE NOTE:  THE BEST WAY TO REACH ME IS BY EMAIL

Medical history included cold sores ever since she was a little girl. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient thought she had a side effect from her COVID vaccine and she wanted to know if anyone else had it and then to report. After receiving the first shot, she got a cold sore the day after, on 09Mar2021, she didn&#39;t remember exactly how long it lasted, it was just a small cold sore, just a normal 7-10 day one, that&#39;s all it lasted. She never thought anything of it because she has gotten cold sores ever since she was a little girl. She recovered completely from the first one in Mar2021. Then she got the second shot, she had cold sores all over her mouth, this one was huge, on her bottom and top lip, tongue, like they were still there. It began 31Mar2021 and it&#39;s ongoing. The cold sore got worse when it started, then started to dry out and heal. Patient stated that it&#39;s in the drying and healing stage, as cold sores go. She supposed it is getting better, it still hurts and itches though. Since it is a pretty bad outbreak and so she&#39;s wondering if this is a side effect of this vaccine because she understands there will be boosters and perhaps will have to take it again next year. Patient had blood work done in between the first dose and the second dose in Mar2021. She is unsure of the blood tests or results, just the standard blood work. The event did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.  Outcome of the event was recovered in Mar2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Strong headaches were common &amp; continue. Eight days out that swelling is still going down. The doctor visit was a waste of time &amp; money. They knew little &amp; couldn&#39;t offer any suggestions. She was afraid to get the second shot because the doctor did tell her side effects would be worse with that one. She had lost a week of her life trying to keep warm. Her temperature did go up to normal &amp; past on day 8 after she was in a very hot vehicle for 1/2 hr. Events resulted in visit to Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic. No treatment received for events. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A currently 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 02Mar2021 16:00 (also reported as 16:30) (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 66-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bell&#39;s palsy from 07Jan2015; and an unspecified risk factor. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not have any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient did not have family medical history that was relevant to adverse events and no relevant tests were done. The patient previously took shingles vaccine (Merck) that started with the letter &#39;Z&#39; and had Bell&#39;s Palsy in Jan2015 which was exactly 6 weeks after she got a shingles vaccine; tetanus vaccines 10 years ago as a booster and experienced severe swelling on her arm, swelling in her body; Quadravalent flu vaccine and never had a reaction to the flu vaccines; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (reported as &#39;Pfizer COVID&#39;) for COVID-19 immunisation on 02Feb2021 in the left arm. On 24Apr2021, the patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy. On unspecified dates, the patient experienced fever blisters, ear ache and stress. The events were reported as follows: Her HCP should have the information on the shingles vaccine she got in 2015. When she had bell&#39;s palsy the 1st time in 2015, she had to go to the hospital for a day and a half to rule out everything and the best they found was that she had herpes simplex based on the blood work done at that time and it was what her HCP believed it was at that because it showed she had some kind of virus but neither time she had bell&#39;s palsy did she have seizure or other symptoms other than the ear ache she had this time. The patient got the second dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and on 24Apr2021 she went to the emergency room with Bell&#39;s palsy. She can talk better when she holds her mouth. She was out of town when she noticed the symptoms of bell&#39;s palsy the night before on 24Apr2021 and when she got home she then went to the emergency room on 25Apr2021; she could tell something was happening again and it was noticeable and she had an ear ache the day before and her face was drooping. The HCPs swear there was no correlation between the vaccine and bell&#39;s palsy but she found this very coincidental. The patient stated that she would rather get bell&#39;s palsy again than get covid. For treatment, the only thing she has done was to call the HCP to schedule the follow-up visit as directed by the emergency room (ER) HCP; she went to the ER to rule out stroke and they did rule out stroke; states the only other thing she can think of is that she had quite a bit of stress because they put down her dog on Sunday and other than that she had an ear ache at her granddaughter&#39;s track meet on the day before on 24Apr2021 and the emergency room visit was on 25Apr2021. She has had recurrent fever blisters and her HCP has given her a prescription for Valcyclovir and she takes that at the onset of fever blisters and where she gets the fever blisters is constantly on the previous side where she had bell&#39;s palsy and was in the same spot on her left side of her lip. States the Valcyclovir she has was one gram tablets and she takes one when she has a fever blister and one 12 hours later; states she has two prescriptions for the Valcyclovir and they are in orange pharmacy bottles with no lot numbers, expiry dates and NDC numbers and the other prescription for Valcyclovir is also 1 gram and she takes it three times per day now after this outbreak. The patient required a visit to the ER or medical doctor office. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                get sore arm; Anaphylactic reaction; Shortness of breath; look miserable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 09May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177; Expiration Date: Aug2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma since she was 8 years old, when she was a child her asthma was really bad and then she would say after 2004, she would say she went to chemotherapy and then 2005 her asthma got a lot better, didn&#39;t have it really bad as she used to, one doctor said he had heard that from patient they go through the chemo and their immune system change, she carried her little inhaler, but she don&#39;t have (incomplete sentence), she had asthma but not really bad, she was not like walking around every day with asthma packs but she have asthma and she keep little inhaler, for eg; if there is lot of pollen in air then she will need to take out her inhaler; breast cancer; seizure; hypertension, high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included zonisamide taken for seizure, lacosamide (VIMPAT) taken for seizure, losartan taken for hypertension, atorvastatin taken for high cholesterol, all start and stop date were not reported. Some years ago when she in 2005 when she was on the end like she said its 2005 and she was right on the end of being treated for breast cancer. she was taking, the doctor put her on Tamoxifen and she woke up one morning to really short of her breath and she thought it was her asthma, so the lady she was staying with said you look miserable and she said let her get back on the store and have her take her to the ER she said call now and it turned she had a blood clot in her lungs but &#39;Dr PRIVACY&#39; (not spelled) who was treating her, he was a cancer specialist he said PRIVACY she was so proud of her, he said that she got to take you off the Tamoxifen, it was that Tamoxifen that caused blood clot in your lung. A blood clot in the lungs was the side effect of the Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen was one of the drug they give women who have had breast cancer and are right at the end of the treatment and put us on Tamoxifen and she ended up with a little bit of blood clot in her lungs. He said that was one of the effects of Tamoxifen. So, that was like in 2008, 2009 it was 12 years ago, could have 11 years ago but this goes to show her body may have potency for allergic reaction. The patient stated she had short of her breath because she did have allergic reaction shortness of breath with Pfizer Vaccine first dose at a pharmacy yesterday 09May2021, had been given Prednisone so. She did shortness of breath about 45 minutes after she took it because we had to sit there about she would say we were sitting there about 20 minutes and he finally said well you all can get up and leave and then about say 15 minutes later she start getting shorter and shorter of her breath. &#34; The patient stated, she just needed to Pfizer certainly reporting acting as if this was just a completely safe vaccine there are unsafe reaction to this vaccine so she wanted to get this going okay, she was 66 years old she end up going to the ER,  they didn&#39;t give her Epipen&#39; (not clarified further) so that&#39;s when she started to get sore arm, she had an anaphylactic reaction to this drug. Now if this was the wrong number to report it to then she would call to get to agency she needed to report it to. she was on the Prednisone now. Sometimes it was difficult for she to breathe, so the emergency room they &#39;have&#39; (not clear) she up with enough medication now, so she had got plenty of medication now.&#34; She stated it just happened yesterday, when she saw on the news that they hadapproved it to be for children and it bothers me that they, this was  just a break simple drug no very safe. Yesterday when she  first started getting short of her breath she was in denial and didn&#39;t want to because she was really started shorter of my breath and the pharmacist that administered he even said he knew that it was the reaction to the drug because she was full animated before he administered the vaccine because she  was sitting there talking to the two ladies and you know jabbering and remember the days because of flu shots and how the government used it, they didn&#39;t wanted knowledge when people talked about how the flu shot (Unspecified Shot) made them sick and she  was just jabbering so he knew it was reaction to the vaccine. Here was this lady &#39;who was so animated and talking and now she can barely hold her head up&#39; (not clarified further). Patient confirmed Prednisone as treatment. As for the treatment patient stated, &#34;Took the 2 Prednisone and what happened was, if I wasn&#39;t even going to go get Prednisone, but the shortness of breath was going transient, what I mean is first of all I talk and I do fine and then all of a sudden I get short of my breath again and then looked like I had a good night and then I woke up and my lungs tightened up again and then earlier this evening I called on phone and tell them I have to take Prednisone because my breath was getting short again.&#34; Prednisone details were 10 mg 4 tablet by mouth every day for 5 days then 2 tablet every day for 3 days, so 1 every day for 2 days. As for other medications: patient stated she was on seizure medications daily. She was on treatment for asthma, she had a little inhaler she keep in her purse for eg; if there&#39;s pollen in the air, when she got out and then maybe get short of her breath if there&#39;s pollen in the air yeah she need her little inhaler, but she was on daily treatment for her seizures she was on 800 mg a day for the seizures, Zonisamide and Vimpat. In fact that day she wouldn&#39;t take any other medication because she thought well she was not taking any other medication&#39; (not clarified further) to mix it with this vaccine. Normally she take the 25 mg for high blood pressure but she won&#39;t take it that day she think it&#39;s called Losartan or something. Little bit of high blood pressure they cut that down because her blood pressure had gotten, she had some high blood pressure yes it&#39;s called 25 mg of Losartan. Yeah she thought, she won&#39;t take it that morning because she though well just lay off all of that stuff that day and so we can take the vaccine, &#39;mix none of that with vaccine&#39; (not clear), that day the only medication that she was taking was her seizure medication (Zonisamide and Vimpat) because you can&#39;t skip medication but the Losartan and Atorvastatin that&#39;s for high cholesterol she won&#39;t take that either that day. The asthma now, she did have asthma but it&#39;s a kind of that&#39;s one the things that you have it but you are not on daily medication for it. She do keep her inhaler with because sometimes she go in buildings where they have air condition on really high and it gets to her lungs. In fact when this happened and the guy wanted to call 911 we decide well let&#39;s see if new inhaler (Unspecified Medication) worked and it wasn&#39;t quite rescuing her lungs like it should.&#34; For Vimpat details patient stated, it&#39;s a pill (formulation not clarified further), it&#39;s 100 mg so she took one in the morning and one in the evening. For Zonisamide details patient stated, Each capsule was 100 mg, so she take two 100 in the morning and two 100 before she go to bed.&#34; As for lab Test patient sated, &#34;Just had a MRI but no dye just the plain MRI with no dye or anything. Had MRI without dye, no dye.&#34; hen probed for the MRI result, consumer stated, &#34;No because this was the seizure doctor ordering that.&#34; As for date of MRI patient stated, &#34;That was on the 4th I think, but what was the MRI have to do with having a reaction to this vaccine, because the MRI. Doctor want specifically had no dyes it was just no dyes but that was the doctors that treat me for seizure he wanted the MRI done, yeah this was the 4th of May.&#34; When probed if adverse events are improved, worsened or persisting, consumer stated, &#34;today you know just a short of the breath I am really short of my breath but now when I have taken the Prednisone I am breathing a lot better, breathing so much better yes, you can mark improve (not clarified further).&#34; The outcome of the event shortness of breath was recovering, of other events was not recovered.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899, reported as &#34;SARS-COV-2 then it says Pfizer EH9899&#34;, expiry date: Unknown), subcutaneous on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;To not get COVID 19&#34;). Medical history included hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 25mcg, once a day for hypothyroidism. The patient got the vaccine last Tuesday (05Jan2021). When she got the vaccine, the gentleman was from military who gave the vaccine. The patient does not believe that he gave it intramuscular (IM), she believed that he gave it &#34;subQ&#34; because she had no muscle tenderness and &#34;skin a 4.5 by 7cm skin reaction&#34;, and it was nowhere near the deltoid muscle. The patient had a high degree of suspicion that he gave it &#34;subQ&#34; (subcutaneous). When asked for the anatomical location of administration, the patient stated that &#34;He gave it on my right arm but it was not into the deltoid, I think he gave it subcutaneously. I am not positive of that but missed the deltoid, it was lower, it was below the deltoid, it was in between the deltoid and the bicep and I am assuming it was subQ because none of my muscles were sore at all after getting the vaccine, accept that big red spot on my arm&#34;. Patient asked &#34;Now my question to you is because I looked through all your literature and I can&#39;t find anything about this&#34;. Since then the skin lesion within a couple of days it was up to about 4.5 to 7cms. It was still about that size however the redness has gone way down, &#34;the not redness&#34;, just pink, the swelling was almost gone. The heat coming out of it was almost gone. The patient mentioned that the actual skin region was much better, it was still about the same size though. Patient was not too worried about that and stated &#34;what am concerned about is what I&#39;ve also have is a low grade temperature elevation and some fatigue. If I got it on 3 O&#39;clock on Tuesday the 5th that would be day 9. Is the 9 days post injection for dose 1 to still have a low grade temperature elevation and some fatigue. Is that acceptable or does that indicate a problem?&#34;. Patient stated the she went to her internist and he had a look at it and he said &#34;I had no idea, he said that they just don&#39;t have experience like this. Do you have a phone number that I can talk to somebody?&#34;. The patient was about 5&#39; 7&#34; (height) and about 175 pounds (weight) approximately. The patient stated that fatigue and temperature elevation started one or two days after the vaccine (Jan2021). Patient reported that she still have it. The fatigue was much less but it was there and low grade temperature elevation was still there. There was no investigation assessment. The patient assessed that the events swelling, redness, skin lesions, temperature and fatigue were related to COVID-19 vaccine, also reported as &#34;Yes, because I never had that before and I am not taking anything now. So, it is like yes. It is definitely because that. The two main symptoms I am asking about are the fatigue and the low grade temperature elevation&#34;. Outcome of the events fatigue and skin lesion, redness, swelling and heat coming out was recovering, for low grade temperature elevation was not recovered.

Regarding future covid vaccines not enough information for specific advice, however would presume she would never take this particular vaccine again, not sure about a different type/brand.

One dose 200mg Ibuprofen taken during that time. Injection site was sore, sl edematous and red, stayed red for approx 4 days. About a week later, noted pain and what felt like swelling in L armpit, along with muscle pain in back /shoulder area , front of chest and interior muscle of L arm, thought maybe it was just muscle strain, despite not having done anything excessive. Pain continued to get worse over next 5 days, requiring regular doses of pain medication to relieve discomfort somewhat.  As of today, general pain and sore muscle pain is approx 50% improved. After researching symptoms, realized it may be vaccine related.

                                                Four days after, I noticed a soft &#34;lump&#34; right axilla. Cancer Institute did an ultrasound.  &#34;No enlarged lymph nodes.&#34; No sign of cancer The lump in my axilla got very large. &#34;Not as big as a baseball but larger than a golf ball.&#34; I could wrap my fingers around it. Hard as a rock. Within a week my whole entire chest wall on the right (from side to sternum) was scarlet red. And I was getting another &#34;lump&#34; in the fold of tissue where my upper chest meets my upper arm.  I was put on Keflex 500 mg four times a day.   The redness in my chest wall subsided. Five days after being on Keflex, the lump on my chest was hard, red, very painful, &#34;angry.&#34; Fevers, feeling &#34;pretty sick.&#34; (Very uncharacteristic of me. I didn&#39;t miss a day of work through months of multiple rounds of chemo, 5 weeks of radiation.)   February 7 PCP requested I go the ER. Suspecting an abscess. They did an I&amp;D. Expressed &#34;lots of puss&#34; and left a drain in. To be removed in 5 days. Placed on Bactrim twice a day for 5 days.

A 67-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCIN) lot number: GL9266, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rheumatic fever (occurred age 7), vulvovaginal dryness and sore joints. The patient was negative on Covid test on an unspecified date. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 28Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and flu shot. Concomitant medications included estradiol (IMVEXXY) taken for vulvovaginal dryness; vitamin C [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); calcium. On Monday, 22Feb2021, the patient felt draggy, but did not think it was a big deal. She just thought it was from the shot and was feeling tired. The draggy feeling lasted a few days, but she was unable to clarify outcome further. On Tuesday, she started to feel achy and felt like that too was to be expected. The achiness went away on 25Feb2021. On Wednesday, 24Feb2021, she was really busy. She was still achy but was busy. She also did not drink much water for several hours. It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills. It was a horrible feeling. She helps with her grandkids since she is retired. They were home from school and had to sit on the couch. She felt cold, yucky, and achy. It was a yucky feeling. She went home a couple of hours later. She told her husband she had to lie down on the couch because she felt horrible. She could not further describe horrible feeling. Her daughter had called her as well and was unable to describe how she felt to her daughter. She could only say she felt so sick but could not explain further. She felt awful and could not put her finger on it. She was laying down and when she got up, she felt like she would pass out. At that time, she had not eaten dinner yet. She ate dinner, took one bite and the food came back up. For a few moments she felt so faint, she felt shortness of breath, but it was only for a few seconds. After that, her and her and her husband took a drive to go to hospital. However, by the time she got to hospital she was feeling better. She was also talking to a friend at that time who said all of this was probably form the shot as well. Since she was feeling better decided not to go into the hospital and went back home. At the time she was thinking this was all from the shot and no big deal. On Wednesday night, things got crazy and worse. That evening Wednesday she was getting ready for bed and noticed her cheeks were flushed. On Thursday she got up and noticed rash. She was covered all over her body. It did not itchy really, but it was a rash. Not a bumpy rash, it reminds her of Roseola. Her joints and fingers were starting to swell. Her hands were swollen. It started with her knuckles, it went to her fingers, up to her hands, wrist. Her wrist was sore. Her joint swelling was worse. On Friday, she tried to see her doctor, but could not be seen by the doctor. However, she got in with the PA. When she saw the doctor, it could be seen her hands were swollen. However, the main reason she went to the doctor was due to the rash. However, her joints were sore and swollen. Treatment for rash included Hydroxyzine, for joints and fingers swollen/ wrist was soreincluded prednisone 10mg one tablet every day for five days. The patient recovered from the event felt like would pass out/felt so faint and shortness of breath on 24Feb2021.

                                                About 9 1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to experience flu-like symptoms : Full body aches, chills and a headache.  Also my armpits felt swollen and hurt a great deal. The symptoms lasted about 30 hours. By 7 am on the second day after the shot I felt fine however, both of my armpits are still hurting. I am assuming it is from swollen lymph nodes.   (After the first shot I went for my annual mammogram and one lymph node in my left arm was still swollen.)

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 03Mar2021 14:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203),at the age of 67-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received first dose on vaccine on 10Feb2021, LOT:EL9266 to Upper Left Arm. On 03Mar2021 at 2:15PM; patient received the second dose of  the Pfizer covid vaccine, in her  left arm; her adverse reaction turned out to be cellulitis, Patient states, it could have been happening two days or a day before she actually noticed it when she took off the Band-Aid, she had chills and didn&#39;t feel well on day 3 of the vaccine she still didn&#39;t feel well it was still hurting, she looked at the arm, it was swollen looked like Popeyes arm, blotches, warm to touch, she didn&#39;t have a temperature but she  knew something was wrong.  She got an antibiotic started from a doctor, and Famciclovir , that she took one day. She thought all of this stressed her out and she would end up with shingles. the medications are  Doxycylcine, Hyclate, and Famciclovir,  A doctor over the phone said that she had cellulitis, and told me to go into the ER, so early in the afternoon, she went to urgent care and they said she had cellulitis, and that&#39;s when she got the prescriptions. They wanted to see her on 07Mar2021 to check, and it is doing better. The patient was also asking, should she be somebody to get an antibody test, to see if it did it&#39;s job. Does she need to re-do the vaccine?  The patient asked, was the bacteria in the vaccine or in the needle? She feel like there was something in the vaccine, maybe the bacteria was in the vaccine.  LOT EN6203 - She has a Band-Aid from the site kept in a freezer at home. The vaccination Center. She stated she feel really fortunate, she was just scared to death of getting covid. For some reason,  she got a bacterial infection that day, she have no way of knowing if it was the health care worker and bad technique, or bad vaccine.  Psychologically, there&#39;s something about not knowing if the vaccine is protecting me because she took these medications, she was not sure I have the protection, and it creates a level of anxiety. Patient states that she believes she had an adverse reaction from her second dose on 03MAR2021. She states that three days later after the shot, she had already had chills and a feeling of being unwell. The arm she got the vaccine in, left arm, really hurt and she looked in the mirror and could see red blotches from her shoulder to the elbow and it was swollen and warm to touch. Patient states that she called around Saturday morning asking if this was typical or to be expected. She states at one point she called an ER and the doctor there said right away cellulitis and said that someone needed to see her. Patient states that she has no transportation so she had to wait until the afternoon and her son took her to Urgent care to be seen and she was diagnosed with cellulitis from the injection. The patient states she noticed when her arm felt unusual, thinks 6MAR2021. Treatment: Patient states that she was given an antibiotic, Doxycycline HYCLATE, 100mg twice a day for 7 days. She started taking it on Saturday 06Mar2021. Patient states the doctor asked her to come back the following day and looked at it again and thought it was improving and sent her home. Patient states that she also took a one day dose Samciclovir Sunday 07MAR2021. Patient clarifies that she had shingles in past and feels stress is going to cause this to occur again for her. She did take one day dose. She states that she does not have a shingles breakout nor did she have one. States that it prevents shingles breakouts and she took it as a preventative dose. Patient states the actual injection site is still warm and painful. Patient states, because she is on the antibiotic and also took the samsivocloir, a total of 2000mg, she is wondering does that make the vaccination ineffective, would she have to redo it? The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch is requested

This continued on for every 5 to 10 minute until 2am. My urine was tinged pink and then continued to get worse. By 2am, it was the color of tomato juice with several clots. I went the the emergency room and was given 1 liter of IV solution and an IV antibiotic. I was released around 4am and returned home. I was prescribed a 7 day regimen of oral antibiotics. I did not feel any pain, only the discomfort from the urge to urinate which lasted about 18 hours. By 9am, my urine was clear and in normal amounts. I have never had a UTI in my life which is why I am reporting this.

                                                Started with loss of taste on Tuesday p.m.. Just after 4am, I awoke my husband because I was about to vomit. From there I was going in and out of consciousness. My husband took my temp and it was just over 104 degrees. He wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the ER, but I refused not realizing how bad off I was. This went on for about 4 hours. My husband applied ice cold wash cloths to my forehead and back of my neck for hours. He finally was able to bring my temp down some. I used the cold cloths for just over two days. I was so fatigued I was unable to walk without help. Had a bad headache too. My husband gave me Tylenol off and on for days. My fever finally broke on the 5th day. I am still left with bad fatigue and some headache.  Have also had diarrhea. My husband kept fluids in me which also included Ensure. I had terrible fever blisters on my lower lip and the inside of my mouth was sore. I am due to have my 2nd shot in about a week, but because I still have some lingering symptoms, was advised to not have 2nd shot.

It was reported that with the first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose. It was reported that she hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. It was reported that she was noticing since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face.

                                                swelling in my left armpit; chills; chills and sharp upper back pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at 09:30 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to penicillin and latex. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications included metoprolol tartrate (METOPROLOL - 1 A PHARMA) at 25 mg and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E C) at 81 mg (medication in two weeks).

Subsequent Sunday afternoon, 72-75 hours later, I detected a cold sore emerging, without known provocation: no walnuts, no chocolate, no strawberries, no excess sun exposure, no unusual stress, none of the normal triggers. Valacyclovir didn&#39;t help much this time, although it normally stops the lesion immediately. Hadn&#39;t had a cold sore since one in August, caused by walnuts.

Went to hospital emergency room. All fingers were turning purple and swelling. Could not bend fingers. Hurt to touch anything, couldn&#39;t open containers.  Spent 2 nights (3/31-4/1)at hospital.  Infectious disease doctors both agreed it was a reaction to the Pfizer Covid shot.  Also CT scan at hospital showed a small nodule in the right lung.  There was no nodule in the CT scan from Februrary 9,2021  .4/3 fingers less purple and moving some. Saw Doctor 4/5, she wanted pulmonary appointment asap.  4/3 through 4/12 afterbiib fatigue.  Saw pulmonary dr. 4/14,  she and her colleague also agree the nodule is from the vaccine and I need another CT scan early May to see if it is gone.  Hands normal in color but the skin is peeling  off and they  itch and are still sensitive.

NEVER had that before!  2nd shot 4/19.  Next day 4/20 had BOLTS of excruciating pain, esp. in lymph nodes (same left side, as shot.)   And SEVERE COLD, no matter under all quilts.  Almost went to ER...  OVERALL feverish &amp; body pain still very bad.  Am scheduling a mammogram to check out lymph nodes.   The vaccinations heightened every inflammation I had.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7534),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 67years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Beta thalassemias. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient stated she has never had a problem with vaccinations, and she gets the flu vaccine every year. The patient reported that after the first injection coincidentally she did develop a blood clot in her lower leg. She thinks that it was due to a plane ride, but she has never had a blood clot before the injection. She added that she had the first dose on 16Mar2021 and developed a clot in a week. She further clarified that she got her first injection on 16Mar2021 and realized when she went on a flight, which is not that far she developed that clot and was having problems shortly after flight home on 24Mar2021 where her leg swelled up and she is on blood thinners since she went to the emergency room. She added that she developed the clot sometime between that flight and 02Apr2021. She had a doppler study on an unspecified date and it showed a blood clot.  She stated that the outcome was she does not have the blood clot (as reported) but she will be on blood thinners and she needs to follow up on her scan to see if the clot issue is resolved but she will not have a doppler scan for another month or two and the blood thinner she is taking is Xarelto. She also stated that her right leg swelled up and it felt like a log. She reported it felt achy and swollen quite a bit from knee down and her leg was achy. It started between 24Mar2021 and by time she went to the emergency room she was not getting better. She had her symptoms for a week and toward the end of the week she thought she had a blood clot since it was not getting better it just got worse. She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better. The outcome of events was recovering. (As reported &#34;outcome is unknown but pretty sure it has improved because of the blood thinners&#34;./She stated she does not think it has resolved because it takes time for clots to resolve./She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better.)  The reporter stated for the seriousness criteria for event blood clot: she believes as a nurse that any blood clot is extremely dangerous, and she was not hospitalized but obviously a blood clot is serious, and she could have ended up with pulmonary embolism. The seriousness for events right leg swelled and achy was reported as medically disabling.  Causality assessment: Patient stated for the blood clot she has doubts if it was related to the vaccine but is it something that should be known about; for the leg swelling and achy she has doubts but it could have been the plane ride.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the reported events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is unlikely related to the suspected drug. The plane ride may provide an explanation for the events.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year.

She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one.

She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 67-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203, expiration date not reported), on towards side of muscle in right arm via intramuscular on 02Mar2021 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included female surgery (caller stated she takes Miralax regularly every other day for the last 5 years for a female surgery and her female surgeon says she needs it to stay out but the ingredient is also in Miralax. Caller then stated she knew it was not that ingredient causing the reaction), pneumonia (Caller stated she had the Pneumonia shot). Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (D3) at units everyday from an unspecified date and macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) taken for female surgery. The patient previously took zyrtec [cetirizine hydrochloride] for seasonal allergies like dust (Caller stated she usually takes Zyrtec for seasonal allergies like dust. Caller stated she took no Zyrtec at all for either shots) and received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EM9809), at the age of 67-years on bicep left arm upper muscle on 09Feb2021 14:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. On an unknown date the patient experienced skin reaction red rash under both armpits, soreness in arm, ears would get warm feeling very hot, swelling in arm, skin is dry from being inflamed. The report received as, Caller received the COVID vaccine and stated she had rosy red, inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly her bilateral armpits and then sometimes ears would get hot. She had second COVID 19 vaccine and also had first one. The first dose was on 09Feb2021 and she had swelling in arm after shot and has been using a cool cloth on it and was better by the next day. Caller then states she still feels it though and it has been five weeks. Caller states she tries to turn arm and can still feel it but it is not bad. Caller states a day later she had her first skin reaction which was a red rash under both armpits. She called primary care doctor and talked to nurse to see if she should try some other medication before second shot and the nurse recommended she should not get second shot that she should see an allergist. She got to building for second shot and talked to nurse there. She asked the nurse about the quality of first and second shot working together if she had waited and not got second shot. the nurse told her she would have to come back at least four days after the second shot was due or it would not work together. She went ahead and got the vaccine and it has not been life threatening as of now. She saw an allergist three days after second shot. She had rosy red inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly bilateral armpit and then sometimes ears would get hot. She would take Benadryl and her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. She took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for her for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra but the Benadryl seemed to help and her Allergist felt she made the right decision since her events are not life-threatening since it is not respiratory. The Allergist saw her armpits agreed the children Benadryl was working and that she should stick with that, but it is not going away been like this the whole time since 02Mar2021 and still having a reaction in her armpits, after the second shot the flare up was quicker because first shot was already in system still, it is not a flare up like when someone can not eat seafood and stuff like that. She still has a rosy armpit and probably will not see her HCP unless she gets bad but she will go to Allergist. She wanted to wait for second dose before contacting Pfizer to see what would happen. She is really blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters and her skin is dry from being inflamed all this time. She squeezes a rag under her armpits and that it is better during the day than at night, it is worse at night. She is only taking 20 mL of Benadryl in the morning and then evening before bed. The first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose. She hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. Since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face. Caller states her sister asked what did she did and she said nothing. Swelling in arm was from the first shot it was really hot like a boil but it was not red it just felt hot, she used a cold compress during the night like a washrag and by the next day it was fine. She got the shot on the left arm on purpose because she was left handed and could move it more but noticed the swelling stayed a while. When she got the second shot she asked the nurse to give in her back upper part of bicep in arm muscle since it was a better location and it did not swell up and it did not hurt. She can still feel exactly where she got the first shot. Swelling in arm was not terrible. her allergist felt she made the right decision since it is not life threating like respiratory related or closing of throat like food allergies just uncomfortable and annoying. Skin reaction red rash under both armpits was the event started the first day after the first shot then still having reaction from the second shot. She had the reaction a couple hours later and did wait half hour before leaving after getting the shot with the second shot she did not experience any swelling or soreness. The reason she went ahead and got the second shot at the medical building was she asked the nurse how many people had skin reaction before second shot. Ears would get warm feeling very hot, she only experienced it six times and it was usually at night or in the morning from the second shot. Every once in a it while flare up from the first. The hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit. Skin was dry from being inflamed from past couple of days her skin has been dry. She has used hand cream but is afraid to put anything else on it because of reaction. The serious criteria is just annoying. She will probably put cream on it so it does not crack, it is very dry and it has not been dry like this. she has been putting water on at night which could have dried it out. Some days is worse than others more red and this was persisting. The second shot is much better and that she does not feel it at all. She can still feel where the vaccine went in left arm. It is annoying but it does not keep her from moving her arm and it has been five weeks. Since it is not going away it is serious. The soreness had not gone away before she got the second shot so double whammy. She guesses right now it is uncomfortable and that she has had better days. She is not taking Benadryl in middle of day like before but it is itchy so she is going to go out in the cold and work in yard, before first week or two she would use cool compresses all day and take Benadryl during day and then at night it petered out. She is hoping it will fade out eventually. Caller stated that the seriousness criteria is medically significant. She is taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. She took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra. The medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. She only took one pill as it did not work. she had not had an an anaphylactic reaction yet. She is taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. Outcome of the events skin reaction red rash under both armpits, soreness in arm and skin is dry from being inflamed were not recovered and remaining events were unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                I immediately sat down for 1 hour, felt I had something , like i felt possible slight chest tightness. I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

I was cranky, not myself, going to bed, I woke several times as I rolled over onto my right arm.  When I awoke early, I was swollen from Head to Toes, my eyes were slits, my bracelets and rings were swollen into my skin, and my toes and ankles were large. AND I was grouchy about everything.  As the day went on I was just mad about everything,  I began to drink lots of water and tried to exercise to get the swelling down.   About noon, my eyes and face began to ease, but my body didn&#39;t ease till about 2pm, as my rings and bracelets were movable  then. I am still swollen and still angry and it is Friday.

                                                swollen lymph nodes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 68-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at 11:30, at 68 years of age, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 3 years before this report, coronary artery disease she has had for about 10 years and takes losartan for it, COVID-19 infection from Mar2020 to an unknown date; her family history is relevant for diabetes mellitus. In 2019 the patient got 2 flu vaccines at the same time, the regular flu and the one for seniors, and also the pneumonia shot. So she got 3 vaccines at once. Afterward she got sick and was in bed with chills and everything, she couldn&#39;t eat and was sick for the day. It was explained that she was at work but left for the day. This only lasted for the one day and she was fine and back to work the next day. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020 the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes on her left side; she got the shot on that side due to bad arthritis on the right side. It wasn&#39;t that bad and disappeared after 2 days. She did tell the doctor and was told by the doctor it was thought to just be inflammation from the shot. The patient recovered from the reported event on an 25Dec2020.

The real reaction came almost a week to the day later on Monday, Feb. 8 in them morning I noticed that my shoulder joint on my left arm was very sore and all of the lymph nodes from my shoulder to my elbow on just my left arm were very achey.  This came and went off and on all that day. I did not take anything for it because I wanted to see how long it lasted.  By the next morning it was entirely gone and has remained gone and I feel just fine.

                                                68-year-old female evaluated for painful movement of her extremities. Patient reports that her symptoms started the day after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacy. Patient was admitted. Patient has been evaluated by Neurology, Rheumatology and the Ortho-Spine Service. Symptoms improved with prednisone. Although unclear, a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica was being considered due to elevated CRP (inflammatory marker). Relationship to vaccine administration is also unclear. Pt with Hx of arthritis, COPD, CAD, CHF, and HTN received first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Within 24 hours of vaccine administration, pt went to hospital c/o of painful movement of extremities. Pt was treated with prednisone and symptoms improved. She was evaluated by multiple specialties including neurology, rheumatology and orthopedics without a clear diagnosis. Her CRP was elevated to 17.2 mg/dL and Sed Rate to greater than 130 mm/hr and reactive ANA titer. Total CK was normal at 23 IU/L. Rheumatology wrote this is highly suggestive of COVID-19 vaccine induced polymyalgia rheumatica which has been reported with other vaccines but not with COVID-19 vaccines.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Starting the first  day I had muscle aches, swollen glands, headache, tiredness  and chills, this lasted for three days.  Then I did feel better for a few days but had some tiredness.   Then Sunday the 28th my body seemed over whelmed with sweats and chills, I developed a rash in my groin area and realized that I had a yeast infection that was affecting my vaginal area, groin, and mouth.  I have been treating this with a natural yeast complex and Monistat.   I am starting to do better today but felt that I needed to report it to see if others were having the same problem.  I feel that the injection adversely affected my body&#39;s normal  hemostasis and the yeast was the results.  I am not looking forward to getting the next shot.  I think I did have Covid 19 in late January or early February before it  was widely known  and there were no tests.   I will keep treating myself with natural remedies as chemicals will just inflame the yeast at this time.  This is not life threatening but wanted to report the abnormal reaction I have experienced.

I iced it, took Tylenol and Benadryl at bedtime. Today it is less painful, but larger, redder and with itching. It is raised and looks like a small pancake on my arm. I did not have this reaction with my first dose.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9AM on March 1st in my right arm.  Everything was fine until 3 PM when my right arm started swelling.  I ran a temperature of 100.1, had fatigue and a headache, in addition to aches and pains.  By Tuesday morning my right arm from the injection site to the elbow was twice it&#39;s normal size.  My chest and underarm area were both significantly swollen. I had an 8:30 AM appointment on Tuesday with an allergist who advised me to take Benadryl, which I did. By Wednesday, my chest and abdominal area were both swollen.  I had a lymphedema therapy appointment because I have lymphedema on my left side due to node removal. The therapist measured both arms and they were both swollen, including my chest and abdomen.  The therapist advised me to see my oncologist as swelling in the Right Arm, (where i received the shot) was normal for COVID shots, but she could not explain the swelling in the chest or abdomen.  Other than that my lymphatic system was working overtime. I called my oncologist on Thursday March 4, and they fit me in.  Doctor examined me and he couldn&#39;t explain to me why I was swelling up the way I was.  He has only seen arm swelling in his breast cancer patients. He is referring me to get a PET scan and advised me to see a breast surgeon as maybe the surgeon would know more about the lymph nodes.

A 68-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Feb2021 10:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety. It was reported that the patient was &#34;physically fit. She was thin and was about 5 feet.&#34; Ongoing concomitant medications included escitalopram (reported as &#34;generic Lexapro&#34;) for anxiety, calcium, and multivitamins. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020. She also had her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 10:30 AM for COVID-19 immunization and felt a little soreness in arm and light headache the same day. Two nights later, her scalp felt on fire and had tingling sensation in her face for three weeks. A week after the first dose, her blood pressure went up to 210/101. She went to the hospital, they controlled her pressure and put her on a pressure pill 1 a day (amlodipine). She mentioned she had felt a weird sensation and noticed some spikes in her blood pressure. Her physician told her to take another 2.5 mg amlodipine if needed. After her second dose, she went to sleep with achy arm. she woke up that night with a tingling sensation from head to toe. Her whole body was tingling. It was a weird and scary on and off sensation. She stated it had improved during the past two days. The patient confirmed that she had no heart rate problems. She actually experienced high blood pressure instead. She never had numbness, instead she had a tingling sensation still present. She mentioned her 97-year-old mother and husband both got the two doses with no complication or reactions. The patient&#39;s cousin was &#34;pretty sure that it&#39;s Guillain-Barre.&#34; The patient stated the Guillain-Barre syndrome has not yet been confirmed. She had an appointment with a neurologist. The outcome of &#39;tingling sensation from head to toe/whole body was tingling/weird and scary on and off sensation&#39; was recovering, of remaining events was unknown.

Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets.

She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store.

She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

A 68-year-old female contactable consumer reporting for herself received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6200, expiry date Jun2021) on 16Feb2021 at 14:45, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine for age and several comorbidities. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks.

The patient experienced sepsis on 25Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 03Mar2021, gallbladder attack on 24Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, passed out from the gallbladder attack on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, got dizzy on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, weakness from being hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, she was trying to gain her strength from being sick on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, her head hurt from the fall on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. The patient was hospitalized for sepsis due to a gallbladder attack from 25Feb2021 to 03Mar2021. The events gallbladder attack and sepsis required also an ER visit. They did not require a physician office visit. Additional clinical course of the events included the following details. Gallbladder attack turned into infection/sepsis quickly. She previously had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct and now there was a stone in the bile duct and she was unsure if it was related; they will either remove her gallbladder or place a permanent stent. They removed stones and &#34;goop&#34; and placed a stent. Her gallbladder still needed to be operated on, but she was not sick with sepsis anymore. Regarding gallbladder attack the patient reported that it was controlled until further tests and surgery were performed. They couldn&#39;t do the surgery due to the infection which had cleared up but she did not want the surgery right now. A stent was placed in the duct until something was done and the stone will be crushed eventually. The patient passed out from the gallbladder attack. She never passed out, she had only ever passed out one other time in her 20&#39;s where she stood up too fast. The patient reported that she had to walk slower because she got dizzy and she was trying to adjust to getting home. She walked to the bathroom, used it, and her husband heard a thump while he was using the other bathroom. She was looking at the thermostat and fell in the den and she was surprised she didn&#39;t hit anything. Her head hurt from the fall. Sepsis: caller reported that as soon as she went to the ER, she was diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis resolved the day she was discharged from hospital and when she was dismissed all tests were negative for sepsis. She went home on antibiotics for security for another week after discharge from hospital. Dizzy: it was just trying to get her strength up. She&#39;ll just be doing nothing and getting up too fast, it happened to any old person with blood pressure medicines. Dizziness began before she went into the hospital. She was experiencing weakness from being hospitalized and she was trying to gain her strength from being sick. Weakness began during her hospital admission and it was ongoing. On 03Mar2021 the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included haematocrit: 30.4 %, haemoglobin: 10.4 g/dl (not in normal range yet), CMP: within normal limits (all results were within normal limits, including sodium and potassium), platelet count: 159, RBC count: 3.33 (supposed to be 3.9 or more but could have gotten better by now), WBC: 6.1 x10?/L, blood cultures: the results were not yet listed but sepsis was gone according to discharge blood work. She went to the doctor regularly. Her doctor knew how sensitive that was with her, but that her side effects were probably no more than anyone that experienced that. In some years she did not experience adverse events, specifically she did not with her flu vaccine in 2020. She has had side effects that had made her feel ill for 2-3 days and her niece was a nurse and thought she was making it up. The patient was advised to wait for the 2nd dose, she was unable to get it as scheduled on 08Mar2021. In meantime between receiving her first dose and her appointment for her second dose on 08Mar2021, she was hospitalized. The patient was just coming out of the hospital before 08Mar2021 and she still did not feel well so she cancelled the appointment. The hospital doctors, as well as the doctors approaching more tests with her gallbladder, recommended to not get the second dose as scheduled on 08Mar2021, but they could not recommend how or when to get it.

                                                A few days after my shot I started feeling very tired and groggy.  My head was dizzy most of the day.  Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.  I also have head aches but they seem to have improved as the weeks have gone by, especially since I have been taking Aleve every day.  I am unable to exercise and have very little energy still.  The dizzy head continues to persist even  6 weeks out.  I had this same kind of dizzy head in August when I had Covid but it went away in a week or two.  I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.  Will it ever get better?  I can&#39;t stand to go on like this!

She has never experienced pain like this before. The R leg is also swollen from the calf down. She reports that sometimes the leg looks purple-ish and she endorses some tingling in the foot. Over the past couple weeks, she has also noted new dyspnea when walking. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations, or cough. Of note, the patient had COVID-19 in November and since then has had some upper back pain which she currently has but it feels the same as usually does for her

                                                She got the vaccine at 2:00, around 4:00 she started with fatigue with headache, dizziness, somewhat blurry vision (not extreme), chills up her full spine to her head from the bottom.  She also at that time noticed a lump on her right arm and difficulty raising her arm straight out due to severe intensity of pain.   She had difficulty of neurological function and paralysis and reaction of the right leg to just above the knee into her toes.  She had paralysis feeling and also heavy swelling that was noticed by 6:00 that day.  She also noticed that night that no position gave her comfort to be able to sleep, which kept going and she still has the paralysis, numbness, chills, fatigue.  The headaches are getting sharper, more intense in her right temple area which is very sharp, which is not normal for her.   The tumor she had gave her squeezing headache pain across her eyes and the to of her head but not the temples.   The 2nd shot brought about 3 days of wheezing, which she does  not have any lung or heart issues.  She has been having difficulty with just having normal breathing patter as she does not feel it is quite right for getting oxygen as it had been prior.     She went to her PCP last Friday, 4/16/21 who has ordered an MRI.  He has consulted with the neuro-specialist that she had with her tumor.  He will follow through with more blood work more than likely.  He did mention to her about having a COVID test to double check that end of that.  She did not have this done due to the fact that she had the brain tumor surgery and that is how they did that approach.    She was just staring to have resolution of some of her symptoms from the 1st vaccine from the right leg when she got this one.   When she got the 2nd vaccine she had intense swelling in the left leg from the knee down.   There is a definite difference in the size of the legs.   Her PCP said that there is definite damage from his testing at her recent appointment.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic and high blood pressure; both diagnosed long before, probably 20 years before. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient said that after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, she developed rashes, and swelling on the mouth, lips and face on 01Apr2021. She was told not to receive the second dose but called to confirm if it was true. Patient waited the 15 minutes she was told to after the vaccine. Then an hour after the vaccine her face swelled, mouth swelled, lips swelled up over her nose, she had a rash, and streaks down her arms. She went to the emergency room on 01Apr2021 and was given a steroid and was told to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) every 6 hours.  She was not admitted to the hospital. She recovered completely as of 03Apr2021. Patient read the papers that she was given and they said if you had reactions like this you should not get the second shot. She went to the doctor and they told her it was up to her whether or not she got the second shot. She wanted to know whether or not she should get it. She was leaning towards not getting it because it was the same recipe as the first shot and she felt she would have the same reaction. Outcome of the events was resolved.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 68-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 19Mar2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), via an unspecified route of administration from 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to 19Mar2021, at 10 mL for an unspecified indication. Medical history included allergy to bees, hornets, all insects with a stinger and egg allergy; all ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced anaphylactic shock within 10 minutes after her first dose on 19Mar2021. Patient took children&#39;s Benadryl 10 ml one hour before vaccination like ger doctor suggested but still went to anaphylactic shock. She ended up in the emergency room for 6 hours because her mouth still felt funny and they were waiting until she was breathing and swallowing better, and stated that for a week and a half up to two weeks afterward, she still had trouble breathing and swelling of mouth and throat. The clinic gave her a Benadryl shot when her reaction happened and the Emergency Room gave her one also. Emergency Room also gave her three other medications in her IV.  She thinks the Benadryl shots she received were 25mg; but isn&#39;t sure. Patient was not admitted to the hospital. Outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

A 68-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204) at single dose on 20Mar2021 14:54 injected in left arm in the muscle for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included shortness of breath, hypothyroidism and COVID-19 back in Dec2020. She had some food allergies that were diagnosed prior to getting the vaccine. Patient was tested positive for COVID on 21Dec2020 and negative on 20Jan2021. The symptoms followed for patient was a little coughing and no smell for 3 days and a little shortness of breath.  Family medical history was none. Concomitant drug included levothyroxine 0.75 ug, once daily for hypothyroidism, which was taking for 15 years (as of 19Apr2021). No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient experienced left arm painful on 20Mar2021 about an hour or two after she got the injection, did not have much energy on 21Mar2021 08:00, foggy and not clear from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021 08:00, shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021, and hyperventilation on an unknown date in Mar2021 (reported as a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine). The shortness of breath was what she referred to as hyperventilating.  That came a week after the vaccine. The same date they took shot was when the arm pain started and the low energy was the day after. Foggy and not being clear was from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021. Shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021.  In additional to shortness of breath, she had been hyperventilating.  That began approximately a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine. Left arm was painful and it got swollen a bit and lasted for 48 hours. The husband experienced arm pain and said he almost had a fever and felt fatigued.  The reporter thinks patient (his wife) felt the same.  She had arm pain and not much energy. They came out of that ok.  About a week after the first injection, she just cannot catch her breath.  She started hyperventilating to the point where the husband thought she would expire.  She also experienced being foggy and not clear and having no energy.  First, she went to a Cardiologist and he said there was nothing wrong.   She then saw a lung doctor who send for respiratory chest and did chest CT scans and everything was clear on both test.  He did not prescribe any medications. A week after she saw him, she went to the ER on 31Mar2021for hyperventilation and shortness of breath.  They prescribed Xanax (AER 2021434900).  She said it did not work and they prescribed something else. It was 25 mg twice a day which was in a pharmacy vial.  They then prescribed Lorazepam. She was afraid to take it.  She took one instead of two. The dose was 0.25 mg twice daily.  The ER did CT scan of chest with Contrast.  It was negative for thromboembolism (also reported as CAT scan&#39;s negative for blood clots). She had shortness of breath before the vaccination and it got worse. She was managing it though.  Outcome of left arm painful, foggy and not clear, did not have much energy/having no energy/low energy was resolving. Outcome of shortness of breath and hyperventilation was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program via a contactable consumer (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Medical history included COVID-19 virus from Jun2020 to an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported fever, joint pain and tiredness, experienced fever, cold and chills after the first dose, all on Jan2021. She was asking how long these symptoms usually persist. The patient received COVID shot last Thursday. Had chills, fever, ugly fever blisters, and fatigue. The patient asked how long does the fatigue stay in the system because she is really tired. She was tired since 22Jan2021. She had chills on the night of 22Jan2021. She is done with fever and chills, she is just tired. Had COVID-19 virus in Jun2020. Feel like she has it again. The temperature was 99 degrees, began on night of 22Jan2021. Fever blisters started on 23Jan2021 reported as are subsiding, but still present. She was still really tired. Woke up Saturday and thought she had COVID-19 virus all over again. The events did not require visit to AES, because she was ok.

Initially arm not very painful, but a couple days after injection arm seemed to be getting worse - swelling, redness spreading in a rectangular shape, white around edges, and slightly itchy.   After telehealth visit with immunologist on 2/8/21 I began steroid cream, and it is getting better.   As of 2/13/21 still large red area but more pink now, practically no swelling, pain or itching.

I still have symptoms 4 days later.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.

                                                One week after Vaccine #1 I began to have swelling &amp; itching of the face-eyes, lips and cheeks, extreme itching of both hands, massive diarrhea and some difficulty swallowing. I took oral benadryl (50 mg) and prednisone (@ 50 mg) and applied cold packs to my face and hands. I also took Allegra 180 mg LA 2x/daily for two weeks after the reaction. Vaccine dose 2 was administered on 2/17/2021 (Pfizer, Lot # EN6201) at Hospital, . One week after that (2/25/2021) I again had facial swelling and itching and massive diarrhea. I took Benadryl 25 mg and Allegra 2x/day and continue to do so.  The facial swelling/itching continued.             In addition I had, since the first vaccine, extreme fatigue, resulting in a decrease in my ability to walk (down from 3 miles to just over 1 mile) and to swim (shortness of breath, reduction in ability to swim laps). I visited my Rheumatologist on 3/2/2021 and he administered an injection of methylprednisolone to try and tamp down the continuing reaction. That seems to have made a difference.

A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number:  EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, second dose on 17Feb2021 at single dose, for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  There were no concomitant medications. Patient took the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Lot: EL9264) on 27Jan2021 for COVID-19 vaccination. Patient got her second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine 17Feb2021 and experienced side effects such as painful lymph node and breast pain on 18Feb2021. She said that her lymph node in her breast is killing her on the side that she had the vaccine. She clarified that it is very painful and her breast itself is very painful. She said that she did go to the doctor to be sure that is what it was. She further reported that by Thursday night (18Feb2021), it started bothering and her breast started bothering her. She thought she pulled a muscle at first. She said that it has progressed and got worse and that Sunday night she was in agony. She called the doctor Monday for her left breast that hurts.  She said that she is taking ibuprofen (ADVIL, Lot: DJ6716, Expiration: Dec2022), taking 3 of them at a time, but it is not really helping. She had no reaction at the injection site. It is not red and you cannot see anything there. She said that is why she is not even sure. She said that there was no pain at all there. She said that there is nothing wrong with her and she does not feel sick, she just hurts. She said that she was tired because she is not sleeping well due to the pain. Patient wants to know what pain medication she could use that will not counteract the vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Vancomycin and azithromycin dc&#39;d.  3/11: Discharged from hospital. Patient admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to right basilar community-acquired pneumonia.  Blood culture grew Streptococcus pyogenes, patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and switched to Ancef . repeat blood culture on 03/04/2021 showed no growth. Patient will complete a total 14 day course of antibiotics with amoxicillin from culture negative date. Patient had right-sided pleural effusion, pulmonary consulted and she underwent thoracentesis x2 culture showed no growth, considered parapneumonic effusion.  Patient required 2 L continuous oxygen and deemed stable for discharge.  She will follow up with Pulmonary in 3 weeks, outpatient chest CT in 4-6 weeks to be ordered by Pulmonary to assess lung nodule and known thoracic aortic aneurysm.   PTOT recommended home discharge with VNA. On discharge patient was a febrile and hemodynamically stable. Remained COVID negative throughout.

She woke next morning with blisters on the left hand, then developed widespread pruritis that only involved the left side of the body.  Had swelling around left eye.  No frank hives, no SOB or dyspnea.  Treated in ER with oral Benadryl.  Now 1 week later, she still has itching throughout the entire left side, from scalp down to feet. Still taking Benadryl once daily now.  Wondering about whether to get the second vaccine.

Intense pain and swelling of right side of neck for 3 days. Also left wrist unable to use.  Pale, ill.  Vital signs ok.  Then on 3/8, pain switched to left side of neck and upper back. 3/10, right neck again with swollen lymph nodes bilateral.   3/11 back of neck and upper back hurts.  Intense.  Could not sleep. 3/12 pain in upper quads and hips, mid pack.  Feeling freezing cold.  Temp ok.  Called my Dr.  Right side of neck continued to hurts even now (3/28/2021) but at least I can function now.  I no longer feel sick, brain fog, cold.  So greatly improved but not normal.  Reaction has lasted a month.  Vaccine number one resulted in 2 days feeling ill with upper back pain, chills but only a few days.  First night vomited, passed out.  First vaccine reaction was frightening but was short lived.  I am a retired RN.

Reported to the local ER which suggested the reaction may have been related to the vaccine but should proceed with second  dose.  Prescribed an epi-pen.  Patient received her second dose on 3/26/21. Due to the concern of the reaction being related to the vaccine we observed the patient for 30 minutes after administration with no reaction. The evening of 3/26/21 the patient developed right side facial rash/swelling and minor mouth swelling.  It did not progress past minor swelling and is slowly resolving

The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive concomitant medications. The patient did not underwent any lab investigation. Consumer stated, &#34;I am just reporting that I did had a reaction slight reaction to the Shot, Pfizer Shot that I received two days ago. It came about approximately 8 hours after I had the shot my face started swelling, itching, red, so I took couple Benadryl at night, got up the next morning and it was still really swollen, itchy, red. So, I have been on the Benadryl for the last two days. When I got up this morning it is considerably better but I just wanted to let you know that there was a reaction, I am assuming that&#39;s probably but easiest way to handle it just take Benadryl until it goes away. Is that correct?&#34;. When paraphrased the above concern, consumer stated, &#34;I have already taken Benadryl and it helped and I am just kind of wondering how this will probably last?&#34;. Consumer stated, &#34;Well it is getting better, I mean I don&#39;t need to go to the doctor. I just want to make a report because I know you are trying to get all the information you can on vaccination.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Just when I took it or they gave it to me, is that what you want? 27Jan2021, that is when I received the shot.&#34; Consumer added, &#34;I haven&#39;t received the second one yet. It&#39;s due in February.&#34; Outcome of the events were recovering.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 69-year-old female patient (patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN3248, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Feb2021, 15:30 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 69 years). Medical history included blood pressure and thyroid. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, valsartan, furosemide, acetaminophen. No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Feb2021, 3 hours after the patient received the vaccination at 18:30 the patient&#39;s left leg from the knee down started to swell, got really hard and became very painful. She could hardly walk and afterwards the pain was so intense that she went to the doctor. Doctor took X-rays of her left leg on 16Feb2021, then he diagnosed her with blood clots. He gave the patient 2 heparin shots and immediately sent her to the hospital for a deep vein ultrasound on 16Feb2021. The results showed blood clot in the leg. The patient was prescribed medication and sent home. Her leg continued to be rock hard and painful. On 02Mar2021, the patient was sent for a blood panel work up. There was no improvement. On 08Mar2021, the doctor sent her for a lung CT scan. On the same evening, the patient was called to the doctor&#39;s office and was sent to ER immediately as the results showed blood clot in the lung. The patient&#39;s dose of Eliquis was doubled. This has now been going for 5 weeks, the patient had not been without pain during this time. Her left leg hardness had gone down a little but was still twice the size of her right leg, knee was huge. The swelling never goes down, not even at night. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. This case was reported as serious. The outcome of all the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm, on 03Feb2021 at 03:30 PM (15:30), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3247) on 13Jan2021 at the age of 68 years for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. The patient had a lot of side effects after her second vaccine which was given on 03Feb2021 at 03:30 in the afternoon. That same evening (03Feb2021), the patient noticed some soreness in the area of the shot, achy in the shot area. Then the next day (04Feb2021), the patient was achy all over (aches and pains all over) in the morning and as the day went on, she got the fever of 101.5 Fahrenheit that day (04Feb2021). For the fever, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and the fever went away. It went away during the night so sometime either on 04Feb2021 or 05Feb2021. The patient did not have fever when she woke up on 05Feb2021. The patient also had nausea (feeling nauseous) which began on 04Feb2021 which resolved; that went on for about 3 days all together (unspecified). The patient was also very tired on 04Feb2021; tiredness it is not ongoing, but she does not recall when that recovered. The patient knows she had it at the same time as the aches and pains and the fever. In Feb2021, the patient noticed swelling beside her clavicle on the same side that she got the shot on, on the right side of her body. The patient went to the urgent care and it turns out she had a swollen lymph node there and it was tender (Feb2021). The patient confirmed that it was on her right side near her clavicle on the same side she got the injection, the right side. The swollen lymph nodes were not swollen anymore but they (lymph nodes) were tender around that area still. The patient did go to the urgent care on Friday (05Feb2021) due to the swelling on her clavicle. The patient did not realize it was a swollen lymph node. They did not do any testing or blood test they just looked at the area of the swelling of the lymph nodes. Swollen lymph nodes that were tender resulted in emergency room and physician office visit. The outcome of &#34;Soreness in the area of the shot, achy in the shot area&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lymph node was tender&#34;. The patient recovered from &#34;Aches and pains all over&#34; on 05Feb2021; and from the remaining events in Feb2021.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old woman with newly diagnosed pericarditis in March 2021, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with progressively worsening chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. Patient was in her usual state of health until 3/1/2021, when she developed sudden-onset pain &#34;across the entire chest&#34;.  She shares that her symptoms &#34;came out of the blue&#34;, as &#34;suddenly one day, everything just hurt&#34;.  She saw her primary care physician, who initially felt her symptoms were due to acid reflux.  As such, the patient started &#34;eating antacids and omeprazole like candy&#34;.  However, her chest pain persisted, prompting her to follow up with her primary care physician on 3/16/2021.  At that time, ECG reportedly showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute changes.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed abnormal enhancement and thickening of the pericardium with trace pericardial fluid, consistent with pericarditis.  The patient was therefore started on colchicine and an ibuprofen taper.   On 4/5/2021, Patient sent a myVM portal message to her primary care physician and cardiologist, expressing her belief that her chest pain has remained unchanged over the past month.  She continues to experience a constant burning sensation throughout her chest, aggravated by deep inspiration and alleviated by lying flat on her back.  She shares that walking up the stairs at home leaves her &#34;breathless&#34;.  Associated symptoms include subjective fevers, chills, and night sweats.  Given these symptoms, Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed findings consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion.  Patient was then advised to present to the ED for further workup as an inpatient.   At time of hospital admission, patient endorses persistent chest pain during inspiration.  Prior to 3/1/2021, she has never experienced these symptoms and reports no history of pericarditis.  The most strenuous physical activity she has undertaken in the last month include working in the garden and caring light boxes down the stairs.  She is most concerned about the fluid around her heart.  Patient reports no nausea, vomiting, palpitations, constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.  Of note, the patient developed pericarditis 10 days after her second COVID-19 vaccine.  Hospital Course        # Sub-acute pericarditis with enlarging pericardial effusion Pericarditis initially diagnosed in March 2021, thought to be potentially from her COVID-19 vaccine given time course as no other clear etiology apparent.  Pt was hemodynamically stable with an elevated jugular venous pressure at time of admission, with CXR consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion. Echo 04/05 with small circumferential pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.  Cardiac MRI on 4/7 with enlargement of moderate-sized pericardial effusion but otherwise negative exam, with no evidence of myocarditis or infiltrative myocardial process. ANA screen negative, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP not elevated Blood cultures x 2 with no growth - CRP continued to remain &gt; 160 with ibupofen and colchicine. Prednisone 20 mg PO daily was added on 4/7, with subsequent improvement in patient&#39;s symptoms.   - Discharged on regimen of prednisone 20 mg PO daily and colchicine 0.3 mg PO daily (reduced from 0.6 mg daily that she was taking prior to admission). She will also continue using ibuprofen 800 mg BID.  - Follow-up with Dr (cardiology) next week to follow-up on hospitalization and decide upon tapering plan for her medications

A 69-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 69-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 08Apr2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EW0151; Expiration Date: 11Apr2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from 2020 and ongoing (fought with it all last year in 2020; but was not diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis until Feb2021), ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (probably really got with it about 2012), Breast cancer survivor from 2006 to 2006, and bone density. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) taken for an unspecified indication from 16Mar2021 to an unspecified stop date; cortisone (CORTISONE) taken for an unspecified indication from 01Feb2021 to 01Feb2021; methotrexate (METHOTREXATE) taken for rheumatoid arthritis from 06Feb2021 to an unspecified stop date; denosumab (PROLIA) taken for bone density abnormal from 16Mar2021 to an unspecified stop date. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 69-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 12Mar2021 about 16:00-16:30 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced additional swelling in her knees and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient had preexisting condition of Rheumatoid arthritis prior to any Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Prior to onset of this event, with her rheumatoid arthritis, she did not have any rheumatoid arthritis problems in her knees. With the rheumatoid arthritis it has always been in her hands and arms. She was taking Methotrexate for Rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatologist told her that additional swelling in her knees event was rheumatoid arthritis. After second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she reported additional swelling around her waist. She had second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 08Apr2021. On 11Apr2021 she noticed additional swelling around her waist. She asked if these swelling events are a side effect of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, or in combination with her rheumatoid arthritis. Onset time was about 05:30-06:00 after she took a shower, pretty much the same thing as with the first dose: additional swelling in her knees. She noticed swelling around the waist, going towards the back which didn&#39;t look right on 11Apr2021. There&#39;s no pain at all, it just looks like she has lumps. She has had no other effects from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine other than feels like she is gaining weight. Patient reported no other relevant concomitant products or other medical conditions. She mentioned regarding Methotrexate that they tell her this is a high-quality drug that knocks the immune system down. While providing dates of concomitant product doses caller mentioned she can&#39;t get her brain to work on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events &#34;prior to onset of event she did not have any rheumatoid arthritis problems in her knees&#34; and &#34;more swelling on her waist and back/Additional swelling around her waist/ looks like she has lumps&#34; was not recovered while for the rest of the events was unknown. The event &#34;prior to onset of event she did not have any rheumatoid arthritis problems in her knees&#34; was considered as serious (medically significant).

She couldn&#39;t talk; seemed completely out of it; swollen lymph nodes/enlarged lymph node in her right lung/swollen lymph nodes on her right breast; mass in her throat; panic attack; experiencing some difficulty breathing; anxiety; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is the patient&#39;s husband) received via medical information team and from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 69-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EP7533, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 12:00 (at the age of 69-years-old) at 2nd dose, single in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease from an unspecified date (had it for years), basal cell cancer, and the patient&#39;s immune system was compromised. It was reported that the patient&#39;s father had lymphoma and passed away due to kidney cancer. The patient&#39;s mother died at the age of 97-years-old, and was healthy. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: ER8727) received on 21Mar2021 15:00 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that the patient experienced swelling on left arm where the injection was and little bit of swelling in the lymph nodes in armpit. The patient&#39;s height was 163cm, and weight was 68.01kg; both on unspecified dates. He patient&#39;s husband reported that something was happening with his wife (patient), and he cannot find the patient&#39;s symptoms on the website. It was reported that the patient had the second shot of Pfizer vaccine 3 weeks ago, this past Sunday. The second shot was given in the patient&#39;s right arm, and the first shot was given in the left arm. Everything was normal for close to three weeks. Then on Sunday, on 24Apr2021, the patient lost her voice all of a sudden. She couldn&#39;t talk, seemed to be completely out of it, and the patient&#39;s husband thought that she was having a stroke. They went to the ER (emergency room). The doctor though that the problem was that the scented detergent the patient used for her mask. The doctor thought that it caused a severe case of laryngitis. The patient was sent home. The patient&#39;s voice was still weird last week. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right arm, and breast were swelling. On 2021, the patient experienced some difficulty breathing and anxiety. Two days ago, on 02May2021, the patient noticed that her right breast on the same side as the second shot was enlarged, heavy, and firm. The patient has no history of breast cancer. A couple of days prior (in 2021), the patient&#39;s arm was swollen. It was her whole arm. The patient was scheduled to see her dermatologist at 11:30 this morning since she was having a basal cell cancer removed from her face. The patient was all upset and hyper and was having trouble breathing a little bit. The patient&#39;s husband thought that it was stress. The patient was scheduled for surgery on her face on Wednesday this week and the patient had a panic attack on an unspecified date in 2021 so the patient was brought to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s husband stated that this was because the patient was scheduled for a surgery for basal cell cancer removal, and that the patient&#39;s breast being so large, the patient was worried. The patient had Hashimoto&#39;s disease for years, and her immune system was compromised. The extra swelling could be because her immune system was working overtime. The patient&#39;s voice was good for a while, but today, she was losing it again. The patient uses different laundry detergent now. The patient&#39;s husband stated that these never happened before, and that it could be coincidental. The patient had no reactions prior to the 3-week period after the shot. The patient was wheezing now, and the patient&#39;s husband may need to call an ambulance. The patient&#39;s husband further stated that he took the patient to the hospital (emergency room) this morning because the patient was wheezing and sounded horrible. The hospital record stated that the patient had an enlarged lymph node in her right lung and that her right breast was swollen and infected. The patient was currently in the emergency room and was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was going to have a biopsy today. After the patient&#39;s first dose, she had a little swelling on her left arm where the injection was and a little bit of swelling in the lymph nodes in her armpit. The patient&#39;s husband noticed that the patient&#39;s right arm where the second injection site was, not just the site but her whole right arm swelled, from shoulder to wrist. The patient&#39;s husband also noticed that the patient&#39;s right breast was huge. On 05May2021, the patient had MRI and CAT scans which showed &#34;extensive mediastinal mass effect continuous from right to left side with greatest dimension of 10cm. Mid left pillar idiopathy and subcarinal area neoplastic disease&#34;. She was having a biopsy done today at the hospital&#34;. The patient&#39;s lymph nodes were swollen in the area between her lungs. On 05May2021, the patient had her COVID test which showed negative result. It was then reported that the biopsy was going to be either Ebus (as reported), which is where a tube was put down the throat, and if that did not work, there would be a mediastinoscopy performed and after that, there is a possibility that CAT scan will be done. The patient&#39;s husband reported that on Apr2021, the patient&#39;s right breast was diagnosed with cellulitis so the patient received a couple of IV (intravenous antibiotics) for the breast and it slightly improved. The patient&#39;s cellulitis could lead to sepsis that&#39;s why she was treated with IV antibiotics. The patient&#39;s MRI on an unspecified date showed that the patient&#39;s breast was clear of any swollen lymph nodes and potential cancer. The patient was also given IV antibiotics for breast enlargement, breast swelling, and breast infection. On Apr2021, the patient experienced side effects mass in her throat, swollen lymph nodes on her right breast, and cellulitis. The patient will be undergoing a biopsy today, because they think that patient has lymphoma. It was reported that the patient received her vaccination at a huge vaccination setup at a local high school. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days (unspecified dates) due to the events breast enlargement, swelling arm, breast swelling, breast cellulitis, and breast infection. The patient&#39;s husband also stated that the patient was brought to the emergency room for because the right arm started swelling and that the right breast was huge, then was taken to the hospital room that night. No other vaccine received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events  breast cellulitis, and loss of voice was recovering, for events swelling arm and panic attack was recovered on an unspecified date, and for other events was unknown.

It hurt and was red around it.; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 69 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Apr2021 in the afternoon, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine was administered on the same day. Family medical history relevant to AEs: none. Medical history included brain surgery on 27Apr2020, heart thing, allergic to latex and metals and she was overweight. She has never had a reaction to medications. She gained 40 pounds. She was at 260, and now she was 250 because she lost 10 of that. She had for 30 or 40 years (no further details provided). Concomitant medications were none. The patient got the shot and after that they did not hold her, she just left. She did not feel the injection at all, she was wondering at first if he actually gave it to her because he was very good. She went to the grocery store. She had brain surgery last year, so she was weak anyways. After having brain surgery she could shop for, like she built up to an hour, really and had no problems. She stopped for breakfast and she was fine. She got in the store and just started walking through the store. She had trouble breathing (maybe around 45 minutes to an hour after vaccination) and was leaning on the cart because she was so weird. It went away maybe the next day or the day after. She got about three things and then went to the line and got out of the store. She went home and did not remember when the spot showed up, maybe hours after before she noticed it. It was a raised spot like a bug bite on top of her left (no further details provided). She thought a spider must have bit her. Then, she went to bed and the next day she had hives all over her which were practically on top of each other. It was really bad hives and only from the knees up for some reason, none on her toes or her feet just her knees up and it was horrible. She was tired, weak, and felt ill so she stayed in bed a lot on 28Apr2021. She slept for practically the whole time the next 4 days. She went to the doctor the day after for the hives and he said it was Covid Arm. She was not sure if she was allergic to the shot itself or like a bad reaction happened here. She went in and had them check, and he searched on the internet. That was why she will not be going back to that doctor. It hurt just a little bit, no big deal. It hurt and was red around it. It was more like Covid body. She had headache on 28Apr2021 and then chills on 29Apr2021 and it was like she had the flu only she did not throw up. Chills were intermittent and on and off all day whether she was in bed or up or under a lot of covers or not. On 02May2021 she got nauseated (intermittently, a lot of nausea). She took a lot of Benadryl. She was sleeping good because she took Benadryl. She still had headaches and she woke up with it. It was kind of dull for four days. It probably came on she was going to say almost instantly but she could have been stressed about getting the shot. At the time of report it was worse than it was. She also had swelling on her face and lips on 02May2021 but she also had hives in the same spots that it was swelling. Right at the top of her forehead, and the top of her lip but she thought it may have been a hive because she had a hive on her lip and three or four on her forehead. She thought it was more than that and there was swelling because she was allergic.  Her throat did not close up. She had legs swollen on an unknown date in May2021. She did not think this had anything to do with the shot. She did not think it was from an allergic reaction on that part. She thought she was probably allergic to it because she had so many hives. She was scared to death of getting the second one. She was feeling really good when she walked in, she was walking good and everything, and she went out to eat and the store. It was quite long but truthfully when she got out of bed, she would just go to her couch. As of last night, the trouble breathing was there but she had not been up long enough to see. She was going to therapy later. She was very vivid because she was doing so much better because of the operation. She was still feeling weak but sometimes it got better and then she got weak again. Her body was compromised and everything because of her operation.  She wanted to get the shot because she did not go out many places.  Hives all over her started as a few, so she went to the doctor because it was quite a few. The next day, they were so much worse. The patient stated she sounded like she was hypochondriac. Benadryl was all she took for treatment and took it as often as the box allowed, she thought 2 every 4 to 6 hours. The events did not require ER visit. Relevant tests: none. Chills lasted about five days off and then went away on 03May2021. Hives resolved on 05May2021. Swelling in the face and lips resolved on an unspecified date in May2021. Headache and legs swollen had not yet resolved. The other events outcome was unknown. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 69-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 69 years, on 11May2021 at about 12-12:30 in the afternoon (lot number: EW0170) as 2nd DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization, patient did not have choice for getting COVID-19 vaccine as it was mandatory for school. She did not want to get it but, she did what she had to do. Relevant medical history includes blood pressure measurement (unspecified), cholesterol, dyspepsia/heartburn, and Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from unspecified dates. Everyone in her family that she knows did not have much many problems at all like she did. Concomitant medications included amlodipine taken for blood pressure measurement (unspecified) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg per tablet, by mouth, once daily; pravastatin taken for cholesterol from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 20 mg per tablet, once at night, by mouth; esomeprazole magnesium (NEXUM) taken for dyspepsia/heartburn and GERD from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 40 mg per capsule, by mouth, once a day. No additional vaccines was administered on the same date as Pfizer suspect. Patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8734) on 20Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness at her injection site/arm would be sore, arm was also bruised and swollen, headache, tired, fever, and muscle soreness to where she couldn&#39;t even walk/muscles were sore enough where she had a difficult time walking. Patient reported that she had her 2nd shot yesterday and had a crazy reaction. After talking to her Pharmacist, he recommended that she should call Pfizer to see if this was something that she should report. Patient reported that after the second injection on 11May2021, she had arm soreness in her left arm but, it was in the opposite arm she got the injection. It was really strange. After her first shot her arm was killing her, it got swollen and it was bruised. That same arm is sore after the 2nd shot and she did not even get the shot in that arm for the 2nd dose. It was the craziest thing she knew her arm would be sore after the shot but, not the opposite arm. For the first dose, patient had soreness at her injection site after the 1st injection. Arm was also bruised and swollen. Left arm: She got it 12 in the afternoon but, the stuff showed up 5-6 hours later, nothing right away. It was the same yesterday with her shot, she was ok and about 6-7 hours after is started bothering her. She got the 1st injection on 20Apr2021. She knew her arm would be sore. She checked off everything on her a list she got from the pharmacy; she had fever, her muscles were sore enough where she had a difficult time walking, her arm was sore after the first shot. She figured after the second shot the arm she got the shot in would be sore but, it was the opposite arm. It was improved but it started happening again after the 2nd shot. She reported that she couldn&#39;t sleep last night, it hurt, every time she rolled over on it and she saw stars.  Outcome: She reports its about the same, she is not leaning on it but, it was sore and swollen yesterday. The swelling is down a little bit today. Patient doesn&#39;t know if the antibodies gravitated to that arm or what. Patient reported that she had headache, was tired, muscle soreness to where she couldn&#39;t even walk that happened after her first shot on 20Apr2021 was improved but some started happening again after the 2nd shot. She did not have a fever after the 2nd dose but, had a headache, chills, she was very cold and arm soreness in the left arm. She mentioned that she had a hard time with both of the shots, she is glad Pfizer only has 2. She is still doing things still, she is a little sore today it may be a few more days until it clears up. Patient thought she would switch up the arm for the 2nd dose as to not agitate it but, she ended up doing it anyway, agitating the arm of the 1st dose injection. No treatment was sought. The AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of the event swollen was recovering, for arm soreness in her left arm/same arm is sore after the 2nd shot and she did not even get the shot in that arm for the 2nd dose it was not recovered, while for the other events, it was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal relation and available clinical data, a causal relation between the reported events and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient had relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. On 17Apr2021, the patient had a sore arm, felt off/mild lethargic but that was an expected result of a vaccine injection. Two weeks later in the evening on 03May2021, she had something that had never happened before. She experienced sudden onset itchy face, it felt warm, and her face was extremely red from her forehead down to chin. Her face became swollen, red and itching. This came on quickly. Her face was huge, swollen around eyes, itching like crazy. She was just sitting on couch after dinner and started itching all of a sudden. When she went to the bathroom to see, her face was the reddest and she looked like a tomato and her face was swelling. Her eyes were swollen the next morning and she had hive like bumps and streaks of red welts on her neck. Patient stated &#39;I got a terrible case of hives and my face swell up and it was extremely itchy and painful I mean really bad, I have never anything like this happen in my life.&#39; Her face was literally on fire it was itching terrible, it was very swollen my eyes, where to the point that  you could  barely  see out of them. The next day, she took a diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) but that did nothing. She confirms she got the first shot on Tuesday, 04May2021. The Benadryl, she confesses she threw it out because she hadn&#39;t used any since 2015 and it was expired. She did get a brand pack but did use this one. She has no UPC, Lot, or Expiry. The Benadryl didn&#39;t phase it. On 05May2021, it started to develop on the top of her hands. On 06May2021, she contacted the doctor and got an appointment where she was given prescribed prednisone - 20 mg for 3 days to treat it. It was in a pharmacy bottle, a round peach tablet, and says use before 06May2022 but there is no NDC, manufacturer, or Lot on the bottle. When she got the medication on Thursday she was told to take it only in morning because she could get jittery, people cant sleep sometimes when taking it at night. She started it Friday morning. She reported she got jittery from prednisone but that the swelling started going down. The patient coughs during the call and remarked the prednisone made her hoarse for some reason. After using the prednisone, she got funny things on her arm that looks like the measles. She started to develop a rash on her forearms that resembled measles and developed water blisters in between her fingers and down at her ankle. It was between her wrist and elbow on the underside of her arms. She was also really itchy over her body. There were water blister outbreaks on her ankles and between finger. She noted this was after the prednisone. Patient stated &#39;I am still itchy and stuff like as far other places on my body now the things are erupting.&#39; She had an appointment with dermatologist next Wednesday. The redness, swelling and itching on her face has resolved at this point but her face was shedding. She explained that her face was so dry and skin was shedding off. She had not been outside and worried would she have a reaction to things since this has happened. It was noted she saw a nurse practitioners and next week she will have a head to toe dermatologist appointment. She was forwarding the information from this event to the dermatologist to review with her normal appointment that was scheduled months ago. She wanted to know if this had been reported before and if she should get the second dose of the vaccine after having this reported reaction. Patient stated &#39;At this point, I don&#39;t plan on pursuing going for the next injection until I get some really solid data about what is happen here that I had this kind of reaction. I have number or references going to find Pfizer vaccine I have various things in whatever but I yet to come across anybody that had just particular reactions.&#39; She didn&#39;t take any lab test. They didn&#39;t draw any blood or anything like that they just looked at her face and stopped by. She was hoping to get blood drawn to try to figure out what happened here. Outcome of &#39;her face became swollen/ face was huge/ face swell up, itchy face/ itching, and face was extremely red from her forehead down to chin/ face became swollen and red&#39; was recovered in May2021; while outcome of remaining events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6203) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high. Concomitant medications included losartan 100 mg, once a day taken for blood pressure high; metoprolol 25 mg, once a day. The patient had a side effect of vaccine so after that first dose in March and had been in emergency room at that time she did not realize that acute pancreatitis was one of the side effect of the vaccine. She had the vaccine and she got fits when she had the pancreatic attack and she could not go and get the other one. She had the first one on 05Mar2021, second was on the 18May2021 (lot number ET7533). She was supposed to go back was on the 26th and she already had some problems that didn&#39;t stopped (not clarified), so she got the shot for pain so she could not take on 26th, then she ended up going to the emergency room on the 29th. She was giving Tylenol with codeine for pain and she was given &#39;Oma&#39; something for nausea. She was told not to eat anything solid for 2 days. They did blood work and they did an MRI. Then she had blood work done by 3 or 4 times. They tell she had pancreatitis. They wanted to put her in hospital but didn&#39;t because with the COVID and the lack of space. So she was at home with the clear instructions. She was given IV before she left the emergency room and she was given clear instructions no solid food for 2 days and make sure had hydrated, anything was not solid, she did that week she appear to be doing better, she had consultation with a nutritionist, the doctor said he could not understand what was causing the pancreatitis because she did not have a gall bladder problem, she was not a heavy drinker. Primary doctor did not know, she did not have any of those what was causing the pancreatitis. she had pain, she was swollen, she has to be careful what she eat, she was in constant pain. She never had a problem with her pancreas until now. She never had trouble with her pancreas and in the end she probably would not have reason that to call the problem with her pancreas but its ongoing pain, she was in pain, she was hurting, she barely eat. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                69 y.o. female that presented to my office with a 5 day history of weakness on her right side.  In particular, she states her right arm, right face, and right torso was numb when she woke up on Saturday morning, May 29th.  She initially thought she just had some radicular symptoms going down her right arm as she has had before.  However, she does admit that the facial numbness did concern her.  She had a headache that morning, but no headache after that.  She states that some of the sensation has come back a little bit in the right arm and hand.  However, she still can not hold anything without up falling out of her hand because she can not feel it.  She denies any weakness in the right side of her body.  She denies any facial droop.  She does think her vision may have gotten a little bit worse, but this is difficult to tell because she does usually have poor vision.  Because of her symptoms in the office, I thought it was best that I admit her for observation in order to rule out acute stroke.  I sent her for a stat head CT which did come back showing a subacute left-sided CVA.  Further workup is underway.  Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis Date Noted ? Right sided numbness 06/02/2021 ?

                                                Patient received COVID pfizer vaccine at 0801PM. Patient left after 20 minutes after observation. Patient was travelling with husband at the car when she experienced warm/hot cheeks, flushing and concerned with history of previous reaction. When patient arrived ( approximately 835pm), patient sat down on the chair. The redness started to extend to her neck and it was then decided to place the patient to the stretcher. Vitals signs were done in which the BP was 183/104 and 174/101 (845pm). The redness spreaded to her forehead and neck. Benadryl 50mg PO was then given (847pm). Patient BP was taken again which was 182/122 , pulse 80, RR 24 (855pm). Patient then complained about pressure in her throat, eyes (right eyes slightly swollen ) and face. It was then decided that epinephrine (859PM) be used but unfortunately the trainer box was removed so the epinephrine was not actually given. The BP documented was then 193/112 (0859PM). EMS  was then called as the epinephrine was administered per protocol. EMS arrived (0910 PM) and BP at that time was 230/112, pulse 70. Patient was started with heart monitor and IV. EMS then took her to the Emergency across the street with husband.

                                                Next day after shot-I have herpes and my mouth, tongue and genitals were broke out with blisters the worse I have ever had and bad cramps-still having the cramps that go with it a week later.  Worried about having the 2nd shot-my husband passed a yr. ago and I am alone.

This all occurred on the right side of my face.  I did not treat the pain or eruptions in any way except for regular dental care.  The symptoms healed/subsided after 5 days .  I have a small amount of residual sensation in my jaw near my ear but it is much better.

Next morning, about 14 hours later I woke up ( 5 AM ) and my hands were really swollen, with pain in my distal joints in particular, I could not even close my hands around a spoon to put sugar in my coffee. There was pain on palpation of my bones in my hands. There was pain in my knees and my ankles. Really weird, I have no arthritis at all. However, it was the very same reaction I had when I initially took Ceclor, an old antibiotic about 20 years ago.  4 /6 hours later it had all disappeared! 24 hours after the vaccine, when I had almost forgotten about the morning, I suddenly had fever (37.9) and moderate chills! It also started from nowhere as I was watching TV at the time. I took a Tylenol and went to bed. Next morning I was fine and felt wonderful. I am a physician myself and it was really surprising for me. The arm had no pain, nothing at all, but the chills were disturbing. I am fine and happy now. I have taken ALL the vaccines available and never had a reaction like this, including rabies, and each and every vaccine I had to take. I am absolutely fine and happy and thankful.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3247, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 26Jan2021 at 08:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a clinic.  Medical history included ongoing underactive thyroid, cataract surgery on 14Oct2020 and on 28Oct2020, and cholesterol (abnormal).  Concomitant medications included ongoing levothyroxine for underactive thyroid and ongoing rosuvastatin calcium for cholesterol.  The patient experienced nervousness, slight swelling/tingling in lips, dizziness, like she has a cough in her throat, swelling and soreness of her arm, tightness in her jaw, numbness in hand on 26Jan2021. The patient also had difficulty swallowing, had taste in her mouth, and dry mouth in Jan2021. The patient on the line calling about the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shot yesterday (26Jan2021) and was calling to report on the reaction that occurred. She initially stated she had slight swelling/tingling in lips, difficulty swallowing, numbness in hands, jaws became tight, and nervousness which she is still experiencing. She mentioned she took benadryl. She was wondering if she should go and get the second shot. The patient first experienced dizziness which lasted for a second and this occurred while waiting in the lobby for observation after getting the vaccine. Slight swelling and tingling in lips were noticed two minutes after the dizziness. It felt like a tingle sensation. She clarified she does not necessarily have difficulty swallowing.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room. She only called the doctors office, the doctor said not to come in and go tot he ER. She has No relevant family medical history that she would like to share. The severe allergic reaction, &#34;skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen&#34;, injection site pain, redness of the skin, itchiness, joint muscle pain and whole body was in pain was recovering. The event tiredness recovered with sequelae on 15Feb2021 and the event joint and muscle pain was recovered on 16Feb2021. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

This subsided in a few days. I was holding off on taking my Orencia infusions because I wasn&#39;t sure when I would be able to get the vaccine. Orencia dosing is every 4 weeks and I am supposed to take any vaccinations two weeks post infusion.  After my second vaccination, I had a full flare. Swollen joints, IBS symptoms, fatigue,fevers, decreased appetite.  I went to my rheumatologist and scheduled an infusion as soon as possible. I had to stop taking NSAIDs because my creatinine became abnormal. I had my Orencia 750mg on Februray 1, 2021, but continued to feel ill and started a prednisone

                                                Same onset of symptoms as first dose, but different symptoms this time ( 7-8 days after shot developed symptoms).  Trunk itches and belly fat feels like someone is squeezing it, swollen hands and feet.  This time had puffy eyes and lips,with neck and genitals itching.  Over my body an erythema that turns white when stroked.  On my right arm, where I received the shot, very large splotch approximately 3 inches by two inches (red and swollen.) Feeling of malaise and dizzy.  Stiff neck and swollen joints in fingers.  Visited outpatient clinic for check up.  Given Hydroxysine HCL 25mg x 3 per day. When I was  in my early 30s had an anaphylactic reaction to something I ate???  Went to ER for shot of epinephrine.  We never discovered what it was I was allergic to.

                                                Within one hour after injection my left side of face started to swell.  The swelling peaked within 24-48 hours and eventually affected my right side as well.  I continue to have a swollen face particularly on left side with whelps particularly near mouth.  I went the an emergency care  facility within the hour on the advice of my Dr.  At that time the swelling was not as bad as it would get.  I was told to take Benadryl the first night and it helped;  I was told I could take Zyrtec or the equivalent generic following the first day.  I continue to be on antihistamines and the swelling remains.  It has been 12 days since the injection.  I want to know if I can safely get my second shot.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

                                                I woke up the morning after receiving the second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, and the ball joint and toe of my left foot was swollen, red and painful. I ended up taking methylprednisolone (Medrol Dose Pac) for it. A few days after I completed that course of medication, I had another reaction where the left ankle did the same thing, got blood tests and the joint was aspirated; the doctor injected lidocaine and a corticosteroid into the joint, also the Medrol Pac meds again. Seems to be okay now. My doctor considers it a flare of inflammatory arthritis, auto-immune.

The Right Side of my TONGUE and LOWER JAW along the GUM LINE were EDEMATOUS and worsening as was my Right Cheek. I knew immediately what was occurring as I have a HISTORY of ANAPHYLACTIC Response to BEE STINGS and MUSHROOMS.  I have EPI PENS and BENADRYL with me 24/7. I am also a Registered Nurse. I immediately took 50mg of BENADRYL Orally at 0150 hours, and continued to monitor the progression of my symptoms and my vital signs. By 0330 the tingling in my face and jaw abated.  The Edema began to lessen at approximately 0610.  I DID NOT have to use one of my EPI PENS. I DID NOT make an Emergency Visit to the ER, nor to my physician. (pt also noted she attempted to send in four (4 ) VAERS Reporting Forms to know avail.  I kept receiving &#34;ERROR&#34; COULD NOT SEND&#34; messages and she called the VAERS telephone line 9 times, and left messages with no response).

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

                                                This was 2nd dose. Starting before I sat down in the observation area: Pressure and pain at back of neck, dizziness, difficulty swallowing. This persisted until 3/17. I had a similar reaction to the first dose. 3/15: Rash on face and neck. 3/16 Rash spread to chest and upper arms. 3/17 face swollen; headache, scratchy throat.  3/18: Symptoms subside by end of day, although skin still a little blotchy. I did tell the person who gave me the injection about my reaction to the first dose and she looked for the rapid response team to watch me, but she didn&#39;t find them. I suggest a sign in the waiting area indicating which symptoms are of concern (hard to distinguish immune response from allergy and/or anxiety attack.

The ringworm rash seemed to spread like wildfire on the third day and within a couple of days, both my legs were covered with the blotches.  I had continued using the tolnaftate but on Saturday the 13th of March I went to get medical advise at the local ER and was told to take Allegra and Clotrimazole-Betamethazone cream.  The rash got worse and I called Dr. and he told me to contniue to take the Allegra but stop the cream and start with Lotrimin because the Betamethazone in the cream counteracts the positive effects of the Clotrimazole.

Medical history included breast cancer from 1988 to an unknown date , ovarian cancer from 2015 to an unknown date , she has had lymph nodes removed from her right arm &#34;30 years ago&#34; from 1988 to an unknown date, pass out from unknown date to unknown date. Concomitant medication included olaparib (LYNPARZA) taken for ovarian cancer from Feb2020 at 150mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 1-2 tablets at night by mouth.She says she is a little person and couldn&#39;t tolerate the side effects of that, so she varies how many she takes based on her side effects. She says she is supposed to take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night. She says how she takes it is, she takes 150mg or one pill in the morning, then one or two at night depending on how she is doing. Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1, lot no: EL9264, route left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Past drug history included on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out. The patient reported approximately 15 hours after the shot, on 21Feb2021 she had muscle spasms almost to seizure amount of shaking, full body muscle spasms. She clarifies that her side effects didn&#39;t kick in until 02:30AM on 21Feb2021. She says at 07:00AM on 21Feb2021 she got up and went into the bathroom and passed out, and had a low blood sugar episode she supposed.  She crashed unconscious to the floor. She said that could be from the shot, but she is also a high risk patient, a cancer patient, and is on a maintenance chemo drug. She says on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out, so she doesn&#39;t know if that was related to the COVID shot or not. No testing had been done on high risk patients, so she thought maybe this could be a good heads up for something someone else may experience. Her side effects were on and off for several hours, the shaking and spasms would subside and then start again. She says that they went away, and then she got up and passed out, and her foot was all messed up, she doesn&#39;t know what she did when she fell, but she had it checked and it was not broken, it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. She says she thinks she fell backwards, and she thinks she caught her foot under the vanity. On unknown date, she experienced bruising of foot, fatigue, foot was all messed up/it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                70 y/o female of Asian descent developed a mild, pruritic, hive-like rash on her left arm and leg about 2 days (21 Jan 2021) after receipt of her 2nd BioNTech vaccine (injected in her left arm; no other vaccines given on that day). Patient did not self-treat. Rash continued on 26 Jan when patient was evaluated in Medical Center  ER  described as &#34;3 small wheals located on left upper and lower extremity with excoriations&#34;; she was treated with Benadryl 25 mg orally and the itching decreased and the rash significantly diminished. No other signs or symptoms concerning for allergic reaction. Patient also reports onset of muscle aches, starting within 48 hours of vaccine receipt; also reports onset of fatigue, headache, and feeling hot.  The headache and feeling hot resolved within 72 hours, but fatigue and muscle aches continued. Reports muscles hurt in her arms legs, and chest.  Around 22 Jan, patient began having diffuse joint pain in her extremities. The pain became significantly worse on Sun, 24 Jan. Patient self-treated with Ibuprofen with some relief. By 26 Jan, when patient sought evaluation at ER, she described the joint pain as &#34;unbearable&#34; and rated pain intensity as 9/10. In the ER, patient was afebrile and her exam noted: bilateral hand and wrist swelling (left&gt;right), but no redness or warmth at joints; full ROM, but pain increased with movements. Diagnosed as reactive arthritis and prescribed Tiger Balm and Lidocaine patches, with continued Ibuprofen recommended.  At follow-up appointment with patient&#39;s PCM on 29 Jan, she reported continued muscle and joint pains. She reported some relief with topical analgesics and Ibuprofen, but Ibuprofen upset her stomach, so was changed to Celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as needed. Topicals and Benadryl were renewed. (Benadryl helped rash, but patient ran out and had recurrence of pruritic rash.) Muscle pain continued in her extremities. Reported fair control of muscle pain with topical analgesics and Celecoxib. Reported having &#34;muscle spasms&#34; in her hands. Patient reported increased sensitivity  painful sensation when she touched something cold. Reported using a pot holder to hold a cold can of soda to reduce pain.  Joint pain primarily in hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, and knees. Reported swelling of hands and wrists resolved after about 2 weeks. She also had swelling of her left foot, which resolved. Reported some relief of joint pain with topical analgesics and Celecoxib, but joint pain interfering with sleep. Patient&#39;s fatigue continued. Spouse describes as decreased stamina. An example:  they used to go out to do errands over a 2-hour period and it would not impact patient&#39;s energy level; now, after 2 hours of minimal-to-moderate activity, patient is exhausted.  Follow-up with PCM on 8 and 18 Mar 2021  rash resolved, but generalized muscle aches and joint pains continue.  No localized joint swelling. Full ROM. Labs ordered (see below)  patient&#39;s Rheumatoid Factor was elevated; she is pending a Rheumatology evaluation (appointment on 17 April). No history of recent trauma or injury. No previous history of similar joint pain. No history of arthritis or Rheumatic disease.   Not previously diagnosed with COVID and never tested positive for COVID; was quarantined in 2020 after returning from being on a cruise ship. After 1st COVID vaccine in Dec, she experienced a headache and local redness and tenderness at vaccination site, lasting less than 3 days.

This 70-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6200, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Feb2021, 12:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). The patient was not pregnant. Medical history included colon polyps and diverticulosis. Allergies to medications, food, or other products included premarin, ambien and many seasonal allergies. Co-suspect medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) for diverticulitis. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included acebutolol hydrochloride (SECTRAL), allopurinol, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) and amitriptyline. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Jan2021, 13:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18 Mar2021, 4 weeks after second vaccine, the patient took Augmentin for recurring diverticulitis. For the last few years, the patient has taken the Augmentin once or twice a year to treat the problem (alternative to the flagyl/cipro regimine) and she have never had any problems. This time, on the 3rd day of the Augmentin, the patient broke out in large hives, (palm sized) and had swollen earlobes and a swollen palm on her right hand. The next day on 19Mar2021 she had swollen upper and lower lips. The patient took lots of Benadryl and Zyrtec, and by the 5th day her hives and horrendous itching went away. The patient does not know if the vaccine played any role in this at all. She just thought she should report since prior to the vaccine she never had a problem with Augmentin. The patient had absolutely no reaction at all to the Pfizer Covid vaccine itself after either of the doses. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. The outcome of all the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 70-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 IMMUNISATION. The patient also received ethinylestradiol, norelgestromin (XULANE, Lot Number: 1391558; Expiration Date: May2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified dateand ongoing (Lidocaine patches 5% apply as needed) for pain; paracetamol (TYLENOL ARTHRITIS, Lot Number: PAA062; Expiration Date: Sep2021), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing (Extended release, extra strength 8hours), 650mg, tablets by mouth as needed for pain; insulin degludec (TRESIBA, Lot Number: KZFN101; Expiration Date: Dec2022), via an unspecified route of administration from 27Feb2020 and ongoing (100ml/3mg, administer 14 units every day at night in stomach area) for diabetes mellitus. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ongoing diabetes mellitus, ongoing polycythaemia vera secondary, ongoing osteoarthritis, ongoing spinal fusion surgery, scoliosis, spasmodic dysphonia, pain, obesity she is obese and has a lot of weight to carry. Concomitant medication(s) included umeclidinium bromide, vilanterol trifenatate (ANORO ELLIPTA) taken for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; insulin (INSULIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took influenza and experienced pain in extremity, metformin hcl (Metformin HCL ER 500mg for 2 years and was having issues), jardiance and jardian and experienced drug ineffective and Glimepiride which put her in the hospital.On an unspecified date, the patient experienced a swollen lymph node under her left ear after the first dose, she has a bad back, her joints, her bones hurt, has lumbar pain, which is really bad anyway. The patient states she had a stupid question. Had her first Covid-19 vaccine since she was a senior on 08Feb2021. She was a diabetic. She didn&#39;t feel a thing when the lady gave her the Covid-19 vaccine she was really good and the facility was really good. Started then having every day after the shot a little bit of symptoms but was just trying to prepare herself for her 01Mar2021 symptoms because she has a bad back. One of her symptoms, it seemed like every one of her joints, her bones hurt. She hurts all the time anyway because she has degenerative joint disease and had a lumbar fusion but has never been in so much pain in her life that lasted about 4 days and was really intense. The patient mentions that she had other health issues, and not sure if her insulin and other things may interfere. Doesn&#39;t know if she has arthritis or she may get it in the future. Had lumbar pain, which was really bad anyway, but this pain was sunk down in the joints of her fingers, neck, feet, legs, just about all joints and she is obese and has a lot of weight to carry. It was really intense. Lymph nodes below her ears were swollen. Does feel a little better, but she always just has the pain.  Again, mentions she was trying to prepare for the second shot and from what she read the second shot was a huge shot. The first shot was like a primer and the second shot will be the one to help her really well. The patient enquired that would second shot make her side effects worse. Wants to be sure so she can buy groceries before because she was barely able to get out of bed because the pain was so severe. Normally uses Xulane patches (Lidocaine patch 5%) on her butt or take Tylenol. Puts those patches on her butt since it&#39;s big enough. If she can use things like that would that interact with the shot. The patient mentioned she lost a couple of inches due to history of scoliosis and has history of spasmodic dysphonia. Clarifies conditions before receiving Covid-19 vaccine. Again, mentions she always has the back, lumbar pains but they got worse than normal pains, it was elevated. It was worse 2 days after the vaccine and then hit a plateau and today she feels almost herself. Again, mentions the joint pains and she has Polycythemia vera secondary, which was a blood cell condition and has COPD. Mentions those conditions also before receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. No other vaccines received that day and none 4 weeks prior. States she only has had soreness in the arm with the flu shot she received back in Nov2020. Unable to provide NDC, Lot, or expiry for flu shot. One of her friends was a retired nurse and told her the line for the vaccine wasn&#39;t long that day and they were taking people age 70 an dover and she was finally cleared from the Pulmonologist and Endocrinologist. They didn&#39;t see any reason she shouldn&#39;t get it and left that decision up to her. The patient had an appointment next week for fasting blood work with the Endocrinologist. The patient was contacted to collect product details for Xulane patches and Tylenol after initial call. When providing product details for Xulane and Tylenol caller mentions print on Xulane is hard to see with her bifocals. The patient mentions has appointment next month for fasting bloodwork on 01Mar2021 and she has to see the endocrinologist next week on the 8th so she does not know if the units of her insulin will change. Then mentioned she was on Metformin HCL ER 500mg for 2 years and was having issues with that and they started her on samples of different kinds of things. Has been on Jardiance and Jardian. None of those samples worked. Was worse on the Jardiance and when on Glimepiride, which put her in the hospital, that should be outlawed. Unable to provide NDC, Lot, or expiry for samples, Metformin HCL ER, Glimepiride, Jardiance and Jardian. Caller provides spellings of product names. When providing insulin, Tresiba, details stated she used to give it in the thigh but it made her fat hurt. The Tresiba has been working the best. No further details provided. Also mentions she also has an emergency inhaler but does not provide any further details. The outcome of the event a swollen lymph node under her left ear after the first dose, her joints, her bones hurt, has lumbar pain, which is really bad anyway was not recovered. The outcome of event she has a bad back was unknown.

She said she started feeling better this past Saturday, on 01May2021, then on the following Sunday she was even &#34;better&#34;, and Monday through today, Friday she has not experienced the reported symptoms. She said her primary care doctor (PCP) has offered to increase her beta-blocker if her symptoms would worsen, and that her palpitation could be due to anxiety. She explained she disagreed with her PCP. She mentioned she has not experienced these symptoms when feeling anxious in the past. She added she cannot rely on her PCP and is attempting to change PCP. She explained her PCP recommended her to get the second dose of the vaccine and said, it&#39;s better than nothing or [she] won&#39;t be immunized.  She mentioned her cardiologist, whom she is scheduled to see on 13May2021 said: she should go to the ER if her symptoms worsen, and she should get the second dose &#34;if [she] feels comfortable&#34;.

She reported a lot of her family members had no side effect except for a sore arm after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

These side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection and should go away within a few days. patient asked if side effects from a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could be more intense.

Around 13:44 her left arm became sore. She wasn&#39;t sure, said maybe she shouldn&#39;t carry her handbag on that arm so she switched her handbag to her right arm. Sensation went from the injection site down to the elbow and it wasn&#39;t quite like a soreness; like sensation; then started to feel heavy around a little below injection site of left arm felt a little heavy maybe inch or so from where the needle was put in. She felt just kind of weird. She guesses a little bit later on is when left arm started to feel a little sore but wasn&#39;t anything bad like bad soreness; she could feel it but not like ouch. She recovered completely from these events, they didn&#39;t stay forever. By the time she was on the way home she felt soreness had gone away. She did have a swelling not at the injection site but from off the injection site to the back top part of the shoulder kind of a little numb; felt a little numb and swollen didn&#39;t last forever think it started 18Apr2021 and thinks event went away by the next day, 19Apr2021, recovered completely. Soreness of arm lasted a little bit when she got home it was hard to move her left arm up and down. She looked at the vaccine papers which showed those effects and advised to exercise the arm and apply ice; applying ice didn&#39;t do any good; but she worked in physical therapy so she started exercising the arm moving the arm and that.

Patient had vaccine because something just hit her across the head guess because family members were getting it. She woke that morning and wasn&#39;t sure what happened, woke up feeling heart palpitations and heart flutters. The day she called the Cardiologist she was feeling lousy and that is when the Cardiologist relayed the message that if it got worse to call back or go to the emergency room. Cardiologist initially told her to contact her primary care physician and she thought why she would call her primary care physician when it&#39;s a heart problem she experienced; but she did call the primary care physician. Cardiologist and Primary Care Physician told her basically what she needs to do, and it was up to her whether to get the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Each day it feels like her heart is getting back to normal, but it feels like her heart had been through the ringer with the heart palpitations and heart flutters. She reported these events have improved a lot but she is still not 100%, she would say probably 97% recovered at this time. It was an unknown if she will or will not be getting the second dose relative to these events. The outcome of events heart flutters, palpitations was recovering  and sore, swelling, hypoesthesia was recovered.   Additional information has been requested.

Treatment team Sepsis  Principal problem Discharge Summary    Inpatient Discharge Summary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admitting Provider:  Discharge Provider:     Admission Date: 3/26/2021     Discharge Date: 4/5/2021   Discharge Diagnosis Severe sepsis COVID-19 pneumonia Acute hypoxic respiratory failure Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with RVR   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission patient is an 70 y.o. female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation chronically anticoagulated with Xarelto, S/P ablation x3 at the Medical Center, and sinus bradycardia who presented to the ED for evaluation of general malaise, shortness of breath, loss of taste and smell, coughing, and shortness of breath and was found to have sepsis due to COVID-19 pneumonia in the ED.   Patient states that over the past week she has been extremely weak, with nausea, diarrhea, but denies vomiting. She also reports that her appetite has decreased and noted that the symptoms has worsened and as a result she presented to the ED for further evaluation.Patient denies abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or chest pain.   Upon further evaluation and tests in the ED, she was noted to have severe sepsis as indicated by vital signs and chest x-ray imaging indicating groundglass pneumonia typical of COVID-19 infection. She also had COVID-19 swab which returned  positive result. Additionally, patient was noted to be hypoxia with SPO2 of 88% requiring oxygen supplementation.    Hospital Course patient was admitted to a Hospital due to shortness of breath, with fatigue and weakness, and was found to have severe sepsis with endorgan damage of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.  Imaging study showed no evidence of PE, but did show evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.   Pulmonary was consulted, she was started on remdesivir with Decadron.  She had an increase in oxygen requirement to the maximum of 10 L via specialty nasal cannula during the admission.  With the treatment of remdesivir and Decadron she had improvement in her hypoxia, and was ultimately weaned to room air by the time of discharge.   She underwent a desaturation study on the day of discharge and determined that she did not need any supplemental oxygen.  She completed her entire steroid and remdesivir course during the admission.  She had no evidence of superimposed bacterial pneumonia.   Her hospitalization was complicated by atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, that improved with metoprolol administration.  This was thought to be precipitated by her severe hypoxia with acute illness.  She was kept on metoprolol 25 mg twice daily on discharge, and will need to follow-up with her cardiologist at  Medical Center to determine if she can come off of this again.  She will continue to take her Xarelto as previously prescribed.   She was medically stable for discharge on 4/5 in stable condition, and will need to follow-up with PCP within 7 days, with cardiology within 2 weeks at the hospital, and pulmonary within 2 weeks as well.

                                                hives; face swelling; itching; rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn&#39;t know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn&#39;t have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn&#39;t seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn&#39;t have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn&#39;t given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

Medical history included high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer survivor and allergic to walnuts. Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, herbal nos, levoglutamide, lysine, magnesium, manganese, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, tocopherol, zinc (AIRBORNE) for supplementation therapy, HCTZ for high blood pressure, vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN [VITAMINS NOS]) for supplementation therapy, rosuvastatin for high cholesterol. The patient received 1st dose of vaccine on Friday and on 17Jan2021 evening, experienced the following: &#34;swelling of right side of face, eyes swollen/puffy.&#34; She spoke with HCP office and was told to take Benadryl and Tylenol. She took the medication and the &#34;swelling went down&#34;. She said she woke up this morning and had &#34;puffy underneath eyes&#34;, &#34;like bags&#34;, and &#34;slight facial swelling.&#34; The patient ate at an Indian restaurant on 17Jan2021 at about 6:30-7:00pm and was unsure if her reaction was to the vaccine or food, since the food she ate could have been cooked with nut oil. She said that her eyes were still puffy and her face was still a little swollen. She went to see her doctor today 19Jan2021 and he was trying to figure out what could have caused this on his end. The patient said that the right side of her face was swollen and was itching. The left side did not appear to be swollen at all. Outcome of the event pruritus facial was unknown while recovering for the other events.

                                                Pt noted after approx 15 minutes a tingling/burning sensation of tongue At 4:45 pm.   No associated SOB, facial swelling.  She does have prior anaphylaxis reaction to pineapples for which she carries and epi Pen but has never needed to use.   Cardiac exam RRR Lungs CTA bilat HEENT, no visible erythema of face or tongue and no noteable facial swelling  She was agreeable to 25 mg dose of diphenhydramine and another 15 minute observation.    During this time, she began to feel anxious and a mild headache.  Vitals at that time were notable for bp 178/81, HR 101 and o2 sat 98%.  Still no SOB, facial swelling or other new complaint.  She felt improvement in anxiety within 5 minutes, and repeat vitals in 10 min with BP 152/83, HR 89 and O2 sats 96%  She still continued with mild sensation change of tongue, but no facial swelling.   She does have benedryl at home but I also sent her home with additional 25 mg dose in case she noted recurrent symptoms on the way home .  She understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable returning home- husband picked her up.    I will call her to check in this evening and in the morning and will provide updated recommendations regarding second dose of vaccination.     I spoke with patient at 8:09 pm - she was at home- feeling much better, however, she did take the second diphenhydramine on the way home, as she began to feel she was having some swelling between her eyes.  No SOB  Or trouble swallowing.  This improved with the second benedryl and has not recurred.    She will take an additional 50 mg benedryl before bed, and then she awakes before 6 am- if she has any residual symptoms she will take another dose.  Again, she understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable with this plan.    We also reviewed current CDC guidelines and she understands at this time we would not recommend she receive the second Vaccination.  She will continue to follow CDC in the event that this recommendation changes.  I will submit a VAERS report after following up with her in the morning.     ADDENDUM 2/3/21:  I spoke with patient again on 2/3/21 at 07:45 am. She is feeling almost completely back to baseline this morning, but planning to take 25 mg diphenhydramine this morning as well. She does note mild headache, which is not abnormal for her.  No residual tongue sensitivity or facial swelling.  She noted that when she got home last night, she felt very sleepy and sedated from the diphenhydramine and went to bed, and did not take an additional dose of diphenhydramine last night.  No SOB, trouble swallowing or any new complaint.  No urticaria or itching.    We reviewed current CDC recommendations to decline second vaccination given her moderate severe allergic symptoms within first 4 hours of first vaccination.  She will follow up with PCP or kidney specialist if she has any continued concern with ongoing symptoms or new issues.  She was very appreciative of the followup and care provided.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), intramuscularly on the left arm on 09Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes: diagnosed before 2000, the condition was controlled; ongoing blood pressure high: diagnosed about the same time as the diabetes (before 2000), the condition was controlled; breast cancer twice: first time she had breast cancer was in 2008, the second time was in 2017; and had surgery and lymph nodes were removed: four lymph nodes were removed on the side where the shot was done (left). There patient had no concomitant medications. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes, lymph nodes were really itchy and the itching is worse/worsened in Jan2021. The patient received the COVID vaccine 10 days ago (also reported as almost 2 weeks ago) and experienced swollen lymph nodes. The vaccine was given to her in the same arm where she had her lymph nodes removed. She added that within the last 2 days, her lymph nodes on one side were swelling and really itchy. She added that &#34;it&#39;s itchy to the point she would like to rip her arm off&#34;. The patient was scheduled to have her second dose on the 30th. It was explained to her that she shouldn&#39;t have a problem with getting the second dose, but the vaccine was injected into her left arm and that was the side where her lymph nodes were removed and now it was itchy. The swelling and itching started first thing in the morning on the 19Jan2021, she woke up with it. The itching was worse, or she doesn&#39;t know actually. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s worse or its just annoying because it has now been 2 days of it. The itching and swelling hasn&#39;t gotten any better. Initially she was thinking it was a bug bite. She was thinking it would be better today, but its not. She wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with her breast cancer. The consumer wanted to know how long it took for the swollen lymph nodes to go down and should she take the second dose of the vaccine. She also wanted to know if she should take BENADRYL or apply any ointment on the swollen lymph nodes. The adverse event did not require a visit to the emergency room or the physician office. No relevant tests were done. The patient has not recovered from the events.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  This 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK9231), via an unknown route, on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were provided. On 22Jan2021, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction. She went to the doctor and he was reluctant to give her steroids which was the normal way of treating the anaphylactic reactions because he said that the steroid would interfere with the effect of the vaccine. So, he gave her diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She had to go back to the emergency room later that day and they used epinephrine (EPIPEN) and she had to have an intravenous (IV) and other than that some medications, it had prednisolone in it. Then she had to go back yesterday and she had another IV and they sent her home with an EPIPEN. The event was assessed serious as medically significant. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination and started to receive methotrexate (ACCORD HEALTHCARE, lot number unknown, expiration date 12Nov2021) on an unspecified date (reported as seven years ago) at a dose of 17.5 mg weekly (seven tablets once a week) for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from an unspecified date. Historical vaccinations included &#34;every vaccine known. I&#39;ve had all my vaccines, flu whatever&#34;  (as reported) on unspecified dates. It was unknown if the patient had received any other vaccinationa in the fourteen days prior to this inoculation. Concomitant medications included folic acid (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). On 18Jan2021 (reported as about five days after the shot), the patient had just a little soreness and she thought that was one of the side effects that you have that with the vaccine. So, she didn&#39;t worry so much about it. But then it got progressively worse. And by the time just before she was supposed to get the second shot, it was really bad. But she thought that she was still going to get that second shot which was planned for &#34;02Feb2021 or 03Feb2021&#34; (also reported as on 02Feb2021) because she didn&#39;t want to not get it.  She was struggling with the pain before she got the second one. She mentioned that by the time she got her second dose, she was in an RA flare. She continued by saying that she had her blood work done, &#34;on Tuesday morning&#34;  because she was due for her RA exam in Mar and it was due, and her markers for ESR, and &#34;CR whatever&#34;  were more than double what they should be. Her Rheumatololgist saw her and when she went to the doctor her shoulders, her ankles, her elbows and everything were all hot with flare ups. Treatment included Prednisone 10mg every day which was given, according to the patient,  in order to &#34;calm down my joints and everything.&#34; The action taken with methotrexate was not reported. The clinical outcomes Rheumatoid Arthritis flare up, pain, condition aggravated, ESR increased and CRP increased were reported as unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Rheumatoid arthritis flare up, ESR increased, and CRP increased cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                48 hours after shot in left arm I started to have a earache on left side, traveled down the left side of face, into jaw area and down left side of my throat like tonsils and into neck area.  Into 72 hours after shot my face, neck and throat area started swelling.  At that time I went to ER for assistance due to the swelling and pain.  The ER after taking  review thought it a infected saliva gland and treated me for that.  As told by ER if no large progress contact my local Dr. and see ENT.  On Tues. (one week from Covid injection) I was in touch with my local  Dr. they had me come to their office for some care and scheduled me with a ENT.  They have been able to get the profuse swelling down out of the left side of my face, neck and throat.  I&#39;m scheduled for a CT scan on March 5, 2021 to see where the original problem started.  I&#39;m contacting  you for two reason&#39;s  1.  I have a March 10th. appointment scheduled I need to cancel and am having issues doing this.  Even in light of all this I want to reschedule for late April for my second shot and am not able to do that as well.   2.  Can you assist with any information if this has happened to other folks and if I should be clear to take my second dose.  This has been quite a nightmare and hard to bring under control.  I believe in the vaccine and this maybe just a quirk in how it happened but any information you can give me would be welcome.  I have looked on the website and it does say that there have been people who have also had symptoms like this from the shots where the side they get the shot on reacts.  Thanking you in advance for your time and assistance.

                                                This patient developed a severe, multisystem inflammatory syndrome after covid vaccination that necessitated hospitalization for 6 days. It involved skin (rash), liver (elevated bilirubin and asT/alt), bone marrow (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), cns (hallucinations, visual disturbance), and musculoskeletal system (synovitis). Inflammatory markers were markedly elevated with ferritin over 1000 and CRP over 100. COVID infection was definitively excluded.

                                                After waiting 30 minutes after my injection, I left the hospital and was driving home when I began to feel my face tingling and swelling. This was close to 45 minutes after the injection. I was not sure what I was feeling, but had a similar reaction to the first Shingles shot so I was monitoring what I felt. I went to a walk in clinic about 2 hours after this feeling began. The swelling was on the right side of my face from a midline of my top lip to my right cheek. The doctor I saw told me to take Benadryl and gave me scripts for a Medrol Dosepak and epi pens. I took the Benadryl and got through the evening. I took Benadryl on Saturday and stopped it on Sunday. My face was still puffy, but no worse. Sunday night, my face felt worse and I took the Benadryl again. Monday morning, my face was slightly more swollen. I decided to start the Medrol Dosepak. My face was not feeling good and my throat felt like I was swallowing a boulder when I ate making me think  that my throat might be closing up a bit. I decided to use the epi pen, gave myself the shot, got the shakes from the shot, and went to the emergency room as instructed on the pen. My blood pressure was very high arriving at the hospital which was from the epi pen. I was watched at the hospital, the epi pen had done it&#39;s work, and I went home 4 1/2 hours later. I have had continued puffiness in my face. I have been given Famotidine to add to the Benadryl as I had with the shingles vaccine reaction. This Wednesday after getting the shot on the previous Friday.

Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  15 days after 2nd dose of vaccine and having had no side effects beyond a sore arm, I suddenly had chills, fever, fatigue, and body aches and pains. Classic COVID symptoms, and I had to go out in public 2 days before, so got a COVID test the next day (3/13). Results were negative, so decided it must have been a very delayed reaction to the vaccine. Fever went away after a couple of days. On day 20 (3/17) another cold sore showed up (see my 1st vaccine report) but there have been none since. Now, 7 1/2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine, numerous pains come and go, most in places where I had old injuries that haven?t hurt for decades. Examples: broken collar bone from 1951, stress fracture in foot from 1971, knee injury from 1978, neuroma after surgery in 1985, hip injury around 1990. Also some new pains: stabbing pain in ankle bones and shin, very sore ribs on the left side (front and sometimes back), fingers (bone, not the joints). These come on suddenly, usually last minutes or a few hours, then go away, sometimes for days, then repeat. Also still somewhat fatigued, and chills have recurred regularly. I have not seen news reports of other delayed reactions like this.

Pain occurred with or without movement.  Knuckles are swollen on that  On day 4, pain moved from knuckle to the joint between knuckle and finger tip.  Pain occurs mostly with movement but not always, and is from mild to moderate pain. It is day 16 post vaccine, and I still have intermittent pain in the 3 fingers  where I hadn?t previously had any prior to vaccine. 30 hrs after 2nd vaccine, I also had a severe headache lasting about 1 1/2 hrs.

                                                71- year old woman with past medical significant for hypertension on 10 mg of Lisinopril daily for many years. She had her first dose of Pfizer vaccine two weeks prior to admission (3/11/21). After her vaccination, patient felt unwell and dizzy in the mornings. She felt persistent fatigue and had a decreased appetite. The week prior to admission she noticed a decrease in her urine output. She denied NSAID use. Her primary care physician ordered blood week and her Cr was found to be 16.54 and BUN of 163, phosphate of 17.5. Her last known Cr prior to her admission was 18 months prior and was 1.17. She was asked to present to the emergency room. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stones. Urinalysis showed 1&#43; protein, spec grav of 1.023 with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.09. Urine sediment was unremarkable. Her temperature was 95.6 and her BP was as low as 75/46 and she was put on a low dose of levo. CRP was 202.3. COVID was negative. CK wnl.  ANA &#43; to 1:160 (dsDNA, Smith, RNP, SS-A, SS-B all negative). Blood smear was negative. Cultures were all negative. Echo showed an EF of 68% with trivial pericardial effusion. Patient was oliguric, and then initiated on hemodialysis. Renal biopsy was performed.   The biopsy consists of one fragment which is stained with H&amp;E, PAS, Trichrome, Jones Silver, and HPS stains. Review of all stains reveals 12 glomeruli, one of which is globally sclerotic. The architecture of the kidney is well-preserved. There is  interstitial fibrosis with proportional atrophy involving 10% of the biopsy tissue. There is a focal interstitial infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes involving &lt;5% of the interstitium. The tubules show diffuse acute tubular injury.  Calcium oxalate  crystals are present in seven tubular profiles. The glomeruli show expansion of Bowman&#39;s capsule. The mesangium shows normal cellularity. The vessels show no abnormalities.   IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:   Frozen sections are stained for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, lambda, and fibrinogen. All immunofluorescence stains are negative.   ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:   Specimens are prepared for electron microscopy and semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue are reviewed prior to thin sectioning for ultrastructural examination. Electron microscopy demonstrates patent capillary loops. The glomerular architecture  demonstrates segmental corrugation of basement membranes with increase in lamina rara interna.  No subepithelial deposits and no intramembranous deposits are identified. The tubules show dilated mitochondria and injury. There is segmental effacement of  foot processes. There are no subendothelial deposits. Mesangial electron dense deposits are not identified.   Patient received three dialysis treatments and Creatinine began to improved down to 1.46 within 8 days.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 71-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), tamsulosin, and iron. The patient got her first injection on Saturday, 10Apr2021 at 1:30 pm in the afternoon around 7 o&#39;clock the same day she started to itch, it was mild across her breast and stomach but her thighs and bottom legs were turning red, swelling, hives there too, and she rubbed alcohol (treatment) on this to stop the itch, that seems to helped a little bit, but the swelling was not that bad today but the redness was still there. She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Medical history included shortness of breath, asthma. Concomitant medications included albuterol (SALBUTAMOL) and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (inhalation aerosol). Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 25Feb2021 at the age of 71 years for covid-19 immunisation and she did fine. Patient stated that lot number for shot 2 looked like EDOL71. It could be ENOL71. The lady didn&#39;t write it very well. It could be EN or ED. She was calling to report she had a terrible side effect and she want to document it in the data. She couldn&#39;t give that to computer right now, she didn&#39;t feel well, she had the Pfizer shot 1 and Pfizer shot 2. She had anaphylaxis at 30 minutes and almost she had crashed her car just after the highway. First shot was February 25, she did fine, the second shot was April 22nd and she had a horrible reaction at 30 min. Patient stated that the problem is they didn&#39;t asked her if she was short of breath or if she had any pulmonary complication and so on the second shot she didn&#39;t say anything and she forgot to say she has asthma and no one asked her. she forgot to say and so they had her sit in 15min observation and she was fine and she had gone out after she got her vaccination record card sign, she got in her car and 15min. Later while she was driving she went into anaphylaxis. She had to pull over, thank god she didn&#39;t hit anybody, she pulled over and parked and she had her inhaler with her so she used the inhaler and she got in the back seat for half an hour to make sure that she drove home, she did not call 911. Patient further stated that she wanted to put it in documentation, if someone is taking something for asthma that probably should not have the second shot one medication is not good enough, the second dose and she also woke up in the evening drenched with sweat and chills, completely sweat and that happened about 8 to 10 hours after the shot on 22Apr2021. After the shot at 12:15 pm and she had the sweat about 11 O&#39;clock at night when she had to lay down and she was shaking so badly she thought she was going to call 911, she was that sick. That&#39;s scary, patient stated &#34;I must, I did have crashed in 3 or 4 people during that.&#34; So, it was very dangerous to someone who has asthma. That was probably something in the medication that she was allergic to. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylaxis.

When I arrived at home the burning increased with redness  I reported this information on Tuesday 1/26/21 to the provider of the vaccine. I was told to take Benadryl which I did immediately.  On Wednesday, I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours. On Thursday, my face continued to burn with redness and a rash.  I then started to get a low grade fever and it appeared my face was swelling and then we decided to go to Urgent Care.  The Doctor said my face was swollen and gave me a 1/2 dose of a steroid shot and a prescription for steroid pills.   I saw my Primary Care Doctor 2/8/21 and he said I should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Discovered a lump about three inches to the left of my throat while I was on my way to my doctor&#39;s office for my annual wellness exam    when I  felt a sharp pain near that area.  I instinctively reached over and put my hand on the area and immediately felt a lump. My doctor examined me and asked me some questions about when I first felt the lump and how was I feeling, etc.  I told her I had my second vaccine three days prior.  She gave me a prescription for bloodwork which is part of my annual exam process along with an appointment to see me again on March 16th.   I had the bloodwork yesterday morning.

By Monday the lump had grown to 3.5cm. That day she saw a doctor who examined her and was uncertain if the lump was due to the vaccine. She had a CBC taken that day that came back normal. Nothing was prescribed.  Since Monday, the lump is still hard, slightly tender, and sometimes warm to the touch, but it has been getting smaller. Pt notes her temperature has been slightly higher than normal for her (~98.3&#39;) but otherwise she feels fine and the lump does not impede her swallowing, breathing, or talking.

                                                On March 12, I experienced some pain in left hand.  By the next day, my hand was somewhat swollen, stiff and I had trouble grasping items.  The pain was worse on March 14, to the point that I could barely move my hand.  My arm from below my elbow  was also sore.  I took Tylenol and, later, aspirin.  My hand was swollen and the veins appeared dark through the skin.  My hand felt cold and applying warm compresses helped ease the. pain.  By March 15, the pain started to go away and by March 16, my hand and arm were back to normal.

Then driving home she started feeling itchy, and could feel little hives in each ear.  She was then very lethargic that night and all the next day Sunday, and then first thing Monday morning was covered with a large hives and a rash.  She was covered from one end of her body to the other and into her joints where she was not able to bend her joints.  She tried to use cortisone, but that made it worse.  Also tried Benadryl lotion and Calamine lotion, which also did not help.  She then went to the doctor and he prescribed steroids.  She has had pain as if somebody was sticking needles in her.  In the past 2 days her lips are numb and swelled, and on the right cheek plus her two eyes there is a big swollen area and her eyes are burning.  Now her entire body is peeling as if she had a bad sunburn.   Now her blood sugar due to the steroids is from 250-475.  The site of the vaccine itself was ok.

                                                Lymph nodes under Right arm swelled and it was painful down my whole arm.  Swelling and pain was even into the right side of my breast.  I also had some loose stool.  These lasted about 2 weeks.  I used ice packs under my arm and on my breast and that helped quite a bit.  The swelling went down a bit every day but was still a bit painful.  I still have a bit of pain but nothing extreme like before.  I had no fever, nausea, or pain in any other part of my body.

I wore pajamas for days and did lymphatic massage, Chi massage, compression, and bandaging. I had a total weight gain of 7 pounds from the event. I have been able to lose 2 of those pounds only to have them return when I am not sitting for long periods with my legs raised. I continue to have swelling and burning in the genitals as well as the  constipation I usually develop with a lymphatic response. I have messaged with my physician to report the reaction

                                                the problem was a bloodclot; slight swelling of right foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 72-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure and allergy to tape. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; olmesartan; metformin; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to BNT162b2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 13Mar2021 15:00, the patient noticed slight swelling of right foot and on 14Mar2021, the swelling increased so the patient texted the nurse who arranged appointment. The nurse said to contact the doctor and the patient spoke with registered nurse (RN) on duty who told the patient to go to the emergency room (ER) because the symptoms indicated the problem was a blood clot. The ER doctor examined and ordered an ultrasound and the results confirmed blood clot. The patient was given a prescription for blood thinner to take for 21 days (times/day, 15mg) and was told to make an appointment with the primary doctor. The patient&#39;s doctor was on spring break and she was walked in to see another doctor who said swelling looked improved and showed her where the clots were located. The patient saw her primary doctor today and she ordered a visit with a hematologist as soon as possible (ASAP) because of concerns about possible underlying issues. The outcome of events, slight swelling of right foot and the problem was a blood clot was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8733, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 29Mar2021 11:45, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing latex allergy (developed welts where the straps met the skin) diagnosed 20-30 years ago; ongoing dye allergy (developed warm soreness to leg, tightness in the chest, could not breathe) diagnosed many years ago; sulphite allergy (diagnosed about 1975-1980; cannot eat processed foods, bleached foods, frozen pre-made foods; tries to eat only single item foods; last anaphylactic reaction after eating olive oil at a restaurant because it had sulphites in it; Mother was possibly allergic to sulphites; Son also allergic to sulphites); and blood pressure that runs low. The patient previously took epinephrine and experienced epinephrine allergy; ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and experienced Cipro Allergy (eyes closed, got puffy, couldn&#39;t breathe); amoxicillin for abscessed tooth and had a reaction because of the sulphites in it; epinephrine (EPIPEN) and experienced epinephrine allergy (does not use it anymore); plantago ovata (METAMUCIL) which she then found out the orange one had sulphites. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization and she experienced 104-degree temperature and was sick as a dog and she went to the emergency room (she had flu shot maybe 3 times). Ongoing concomitant medication included multivitamins. The patient got her first dose of BNT162B2 on 29Mar2021 at 11:45. On the same day, once she got home, she became really, really tired/wiped out tired; was so sleepy; experienced sore arm/her arm started to hurt; was nauseous; had sore throat/throat hurt; eyes half closed/eyes closing and puffy face. On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced elevated pulse/her pulse got too high/pulse was 165 beats per minute/climbed up to 195. Her heart rate was 194 at some point for a couple of minutes then stayed at 165 for a long time. She hoped she wasn&#39;t having a heart attack. She had tightness in her chest, wasn&#39;t feeling good and was coughing. She stayed in her bed to wait out her symptoms. These lasted for 10 minutes (as reported). She started meditating hoping her heart rate would decrease and it did after about 15-20 minutes. The patient also felt feverish/felt hotter than usual. Before she took the vaccine on 29Mar2021, her temperature was at 96. She stated that her temperature usually runs low as 95-06 degrees. She also felt like her sinuses were congested; was sore; had puffy, bubbled up arms, inflamed. The patient hoped it was not a blood clot she developed. At the time of the report, the patient stated that her heart rate was 61 beats per minute, earlier it was in the 70s; and her temperature was at 96.3. Her second dose is scheduled on 19Apr2021 and mentioned that if these were her reactions with the first dose, she is questioning getting the second dose. The outcome of &#34;blood clot&#34;, &#34;hoped she wasn&#39;t having a heart attack&#34;, &#34;Wasn&#39;t feeling well&#34;, &#34;Tightness in chest&#34;, cough, and sinuses congested was unknown. The patient recovered from &#34;Drenched in sweat/sweating/sweating like a dog in the middle of the night&#34;, and &#34;Elevated Pulse/high pulse/pulse was 165 beats per minute/climbed up to 195&#34; on 30Mar2021; and was recovering from &#34;Sore Arm/her arm started to hurt&#34;, and &#34;eyes half closed/eyes closing&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been obtained. Additional information is expected.

                                                She had the vaccine, when  she woke up the next day her arm was really sore and kept bending it, and thought that she was going to be okay.  Almost a week later it was swollen, parallel to it and big, beat red, and hot to touch.  Over the next few days she was getting more and more tired, but the arm started getting stiffer.  It kept getting  more and more read and spreading to the elbow and wrist.  When she got up over the weekend and kept putting it off thinking that it would go away and decided to touch it out.  Then it started getting numb going into her fingers.  On the following Saturday she could not move her arm up due to stiffness.  She had some heart flutters, was not feeling right and decided she needed to see her doctor.   She saw a NP and then she went to see her cardiologist the same day.  He did an EKG and told her that she was fine.  That is the provider that told her that whoever gave her the shot hit a blood vessel that caused all of her symptoms.  The swelling was starting to go down and did some tests for blood testing, which she states was all negative.   She went to an eye doctor who is now sending her to a neurologist.    She has now recovered from it completely now.

The day after having the second vaccination on March 3, the rash became much redder and the Achilles heel much more painful. The rash, swelling and pain lessened after several days. Tendon is still slightly swollen.

I called my dr. on April 9 and she  told me that although it would be a good choice, she could not give me a steroid pack because I had recently had a dental implant and that would not be good for bone growth.  So, she gave me Tramadol to take at night if needed to sleep  and Doxycycline, if pain continued more days.  It continued for 3 days, but started to feel better on April 11 after having started the doxycycline on April 10.

A 73-Year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, on 29Jan2021 (Lot Number: EN5318) at age of 72-year-old at SINGLE DOSE in Arm Right for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension from 2010 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  She was taking her regular prescribed medications which are primary for atrial fibrillation and hypertension, however she has been on these medications for years.The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 on 8Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3246) as SINGLE DOSE in Left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  8 or 9 days later after she received the first dose, she broke out in rash on her upper left chest and shoulder area. It spread, and she then had a patch in the small of her back and then, her legs from her knees to ankles broke out. She reports that after her 1st vaccination she developed a rash 1 week after the injection. Explaining that its a &#34;strange rash some of which I still have on my chest, the small of my back and from my knees to my ankles&#34;, The &#34;ones on my legs have never really resolved, its pretty ugly and the dermatologist said it looks like eczema&#34;. The doctor gave her some topical steroid cream &#34;Mometaesone&#34; for all of these areas. However, her legs are still not cleared up. She still has lesions there. It looks and is like eczema, but the eczema treatments are not working. For some reason instead of staying as little bumps, the bumps developed into some large, scaly patches. It&#39;s those scaly patches that are red and nasty looking which is what the dermatologist has been treating. She was also prescribed Ammonium Lactate lotion which kind of helps with the scaliness that the area produces. The patient received both doses of the COVID vaccine. Both shots were given around 1-2pm. The reaction to the second dose is far more troubling and problematic in all sorts of ways than the first dose. About 7 or 8 days after the second shot, she began to have joint pain in her elbows. She was told she has acute tendinitis and was given oral steroids to take and she was sent to physical therapy. She has had general 24HR a day intense pain in both arms. It&#39;s to the point she can&#39;t straighten her arms out completely, she can&#39;t bend them completely, especially early in the morning when she first wakes up and everything is kind of stiff. She can&#39;t even brush her teeth without having to prop her elbow on the edge of the sink. She can&#39;t brush her hair, wash her hair without pain. She has to get her partner to undo her bra because she can&#39;t. She was given a Medrol pack. With the second one, &#34;My elbows began to hurt, ortho did x-rays and said nothing was wrong with them, and that it may be tendonitis. PT who is a hand and extremity therapist said my swelling is strange and asked if I had Rheumatoid problems. She states she has to go back to dermatologist next week for them to look at the area again. In the mean time, she has taken oral steroids and topical steroids and not much has done any good. She has had reactions autoimmune disorders to both of her vaccinations, the reactions began about a week after getting vaccinated. It was stated that these symptoms are better than dying of COVID but its very unpleasant. She has had X-rays done but it showed there was nothing wrong with her joints. No one has done any blood test. The orthopedic people took X-rays because she told them her elbow hurts. She was told that there was nothing wrong with her elbows, but she does have all this other stuff going on. She clarifies she has tendonitis, tennis elbow, golf elbow- but the hasn&#39;t had anything to cause this, and she was told they are really, really bad. Her right wrist is swollen up twice its normal size as is her right elbow. It has been going on now since February, March, April. Her left arm is doing a little bit better but her right arm is pretty acute. She confirms this swelling is still ongoing and persisting in her right arm.  The AEs require a visit to Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. AE following prior vaccinations was No. She mentions she was in the military and she received many vaccines from cholera to small pox and beyond. She never had a reaction. The outcome of Joint swelling was not recovered, of left arm swelling was recovering, of other events were unknown.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

                                                I am a 72 year old woman in very good health. I received the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on March 8, 2021 and everything was fine. I then received the second vaccine on March 29, 2021.  The day after I received the 2nd Pfizer vaccine I developed scalp psoriasis. (I only had this once about 6 years ago). I fought it for 2 1/2 weeks. It cleared up on April 21, 2021.  That evening my right wrist  began to itch terribly. Within a couple hours my right hand and arm swelled and got red up to just below my elbow. I went to the doctor 2 days later on April 23, 2021. I had gotten poked by a cat claw the day this started and was told it was cellulitis even though cellulitis does not itch like that and there was no pain nor soreness. I have had cats for over 35 years and been poked, scratched, and bit many times with no reaction. Two hours after leaving the doctor?s office, the rash and swelling progressed up to the inside of my elbow. I went to emergency and was told again it was cellulitis. They gave me iv anitbiotics and sent me home with a prescription for amoxicilan. Three hours after returning home, my left hand started itching. It then also became inflamed and swollen like the right hand. The swelling went down within 2 days and I continued talking the prescription for the 7 days. I had a follow up visit with my doctor on April 30, 2021, and all looked well. Two days later the itching began again on my right arm in the bend of my elbow. This was May 3, 2021.  I went back to emergency and was admitted to the hospital where they were giving me iv vancomycin. I had no pain nor fever. On the 3rd day, May 5, 2021, my right knee and left foot began itching. Both areas then became inflamed and swelled.  I saw 6 doctors during this hospital stay and they were all perplexed. They sent an Infectious Disease Specialist who said it was a reaction to the original iv antibiotic that I was given on April 23, 2021, for what was diagnosed as cellulitis.  I was released on day 4, May 6, 2021.  I never felt comfortable with any of the diagnosis. I was never in any pain, had no fever, nor any other indications of cellulitis except for the rash and swelling. Cellulitis does not go from the right hand to the left hand, to the right elbow, to the right knee, to the left foot! I didn?t agree with the diagnosis of being allergic to the first antibiotic I was given. The only thing I have ever shown a reaction to is Tetnus. Granted we can develop allergies in life but this is a stretch.  Upon returning home I called a friend of mine who said that her husband had the same thing happen to him after the second Pfizer vaccine! He scratched the effected area so much he broke skin. He went his doctor and she was smart enough to guess it was a reaction to the vaccine but his scratching may have caused a bit of cellulitis. He was given an anibiotic ointment to use on his scratches and told to take Zyrtec during the day and Benadryl at night. That cleared him upI   I have to wonder now how any people are experiencing this after being vaccinated and their doctors are misdiagnosing it as cellulitis. My experience resulted in days of misery and probably around a $20K hospital bills for nothing. I think that people and doctors especially, need to know that the vaccine can cause this to happen so it can be treated correctly without what I was put through.  We are not being given all of the information that we should know. I realized no one wants to start a panic about being vaccinated but this is just WRONG. Wrong and causing a lot of unnecessary misery along with costing tens of thousands of dollars in unneeded medical costs. I can be reached by phone to discuss with more detail . Please give this serious consideration. Thank you!

Clinical course: Caller called after her first dose of the COVID vaccine because she had a question about a heart test she needed to have done and was it safe. She also had called about side effects she had from the first vaccine. She wanted to follow up with the second vaccine because she had some unusual problems with it. She got the vaccine. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She went to University . She asked questions from side effects after the first one. Caller doesn&#39;t have a reference number. She was reluctant to get the second knowing how sensitive she was to the first dose. She worked with her heart doctor after the symptoms she had after first dose which were heart related. They beefed up her heart medications for the second one. She is very sensitive to medications and vaccines in the past. She was in shock. With the second shot, everything was fine on the first day. That night she was fine as well. She got the shot Thursday 13 May 2021.On Friday she was pretty okay. She did have body aches and chills. On Saturday 15 May 2021, she had tingling in her hands, legs, and ankles. Her left hip was super sore enough that she couldn&#39;t stand on it. The glands in her neck were aching. They beefed up her heart medication, but her heart was beating like crazy. On day 3, Sunday, she was still having weird tingling and heart stayed stable. On Monday she did not feel herself. She felt bad but went to work. At that point she was not happy she took the COVID vaccine. Tuesday, 18 May 2021, her heart was really unstable. She was lightheaded. Her heart was beating back and forth extra hard. She had a hard time getting ready for work. She took readings on her apple watch. She went to leave for work but couldn&#39;t find her keys. She decided she would be fine. She was standing at her door trying to set the alarm when she woke up on the floor in the kitchen. She had blacked out in the kitchen. She came too on the floor, and her heart was going back and forth. Her heart doctor said don&#39;t go to the hospital. He thought it was a combination between the stress of the vaccine, and her extra heart medication. She is seeing her heart doctor today for follow up. This is the first time she has ever just completely blacked out. Her symptoms are ongoing, but much improved. She can finally stand now. She had body aches in specific places. There was nothing wrong in her left hip normally. The tingling in her hands has went away, but it is still in her knees and feet. It feels like she has neuropathy. It has improved but is bothersome. She is glad it is not seeming to be an ongoing thing. Second dose on 13May2021, She waited a week due to side effects from the first one because she was pretty sick. Most of the symptoms were on the left side of her body. She had numbness and tingling in her hands and feet. The passing out was not good. She was super disoriented . She didn&#39;t know if she hit her head or not. She is very sore. Her friend came over. Her shoulder and arm are bruised. The doctor said with COVID going on not to go to the ER. The doctor stayed in touch with her on Tuesday, and said he would see her Thursday morning, Today. She thinks she is okay. It was just a combination of everything. With the first vaccine she had arrhythmias and Afib for 3 days.  The doctor said he read that multiple patients from all the different COVID vaccine have experienced a flare up in their arrhythmias.

                                                she was having an anaphylactic reaction; feeling so bad; It was pained all over; she got a woozy after the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Feb2021 11:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes, ongoing blood pressure high, coronary artery disease, spinal stenosis, arthritis, Penicillin allergy (doesn&#39;t have the product that was back in 1969, Drug hypersensitivity), bee sting, shrimp, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing hypertension. Concomitant medication included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes; insulin detemir (LEVEMIR) taken for diabetes, candesartan taken for hypertension; nifedipine (PROCARDIA [NIFEDIPINE]) taken for hypertension; carvedilol taken for hypertension; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for cholesterol; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]); vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]); and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]). The patient previously took epipen for stung by a bee (stuck that EpiPen in her thigh). The patient experienced she was having an anaphylactic reaction, feeling so bad on 17Feb2021, she got a woozy after the vaccine and it was pained all over on 16Feb2021. Patient stated she received the first dose of the vaccine on 16Feb2021. Caller states she had a severe reaction so dramatic that she has decided that she is not going to take the second dose of the vaccine. When she went in they asked if she had an allergy.  She said bee sting, Penicillin, and shrimp. They responded and told her if she had a reaction they had an EpiPen there for her. She has not had an EpiPen injection since 1987. She did not remember what it was like. Back in 1987, she got stung by a bee. She felt so bad. She felt that if she closed her eyes she would die. Her daughter called 911 and they came, but they did not have the EpiPen. Her son called her family doctor who came over with the EpiPen. He said she was having a severe reaction to the bee sting. He saved her life. When she went in on Tuesday she got a woozy after the vaccine. It was not near as bad as what she experienced in 1987. She stayed there 45 minutes and they brought her water and a bagel. She drank the water but did not eat the bagel. She went home and was fine all night. The next morning about 8AM, she started feeling so bad. She felt worse than she did in 1987. She felt like she was going to die if she closed her eye. It did not dawn on her that she was having an anaphylactic reaction. Her friend sent her a text that had four versions of a scripture. The scripture said has different plans for her. She read that to herself and started to feel better. She attributed it to saving her life. She told her cardiologist she is 72 years old and has underlying conditions and she does not want to go through that again. In 1987 the doctor came in the house and the fireman was already there. The doctor came over to her and he just stuck that EpiPen in her thigh. Everything in the body went to the top of her head. She felt like if she could open her head she could let the pain and everything out. Feeling so bad: It lasted for about 15 to 30 minutes. Then caller clarified her friend texted her at 9:26AM, so it may have lasted an hour to an hour and a half. She ached all over. Her body felt dead. It was pained all over. Everything was trapped inside her head. She went to the cardiologist and all her numbers were fine. She told him she was not going to take another shot. She is going to go back for a stress test because she has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. She has an appointment with her primary care doctor, on 10Mar2021 and will see what he has to say. Time the Vaccination Was Given: her appointment was at 11:30AM. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The adverse events require a visit to Physician Office, She felt better and decided not to take the other shot. She ran it by her doctors. She has an appointment. She has not cancelled it yet. She wants to find out what the ramifications would be if she did not take the second one. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations: She does not have a spleen. She has had her flu shot. She has not had the shingles vaccination. It is not time for Pneumovax. She keeps up and follows her doctors. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included numbers: unknown results. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

                                                I have a partial cornea transplant (DMEK) in my right eye. That eye started itching the day after the injection. I had to increase the Lotemax drops to four/day to get it to stop. My eye surgeon says that it is not a sign of rejection. I also got a cold sore on my upper lip, which is highly unusual. I had reduce the Xeljanz to a half dose before the shot.

Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine she developed new numbness and swelling in her tongue, along with numbness in her extremities. She was given 0.3 mg epinephrine per protocol and was then advised to be seen in the emergency department. Her symptoms resolved once she arrived at the emergency department. She was observed for a period of two hours without worsening symptoms and was then discharged. presented to the ED following pfizer vaccine ingestion. received epinephrine IM prehospital for report of tongue swelling and and numbness at the time. She was improved at the time of presentation to the ED. Observed for several hours and discharged home without recrudescent sx. Although cannot find objective evidence of tongue swelling, administration of epi prehospital with report of improvement of symptoms is suggestive that this was a true anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.

                                                a sharp pain was coming from the side of my back and shooting to my left breast/ a muscle on the side going down of my back/ sharp pain when I make a turn or reach that goes to my breast; when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast; when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast; pain was either from something in her left shoulder, or the left side of her back, or a muscle; feeling a little down and out; she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982 ), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 23Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were on patient medical history and concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).The patient said she did good on Saturday, 23Jan2021, saying her left arm didn&#39;t get sore. She said she did good on Sunday, 24Jan2021. She stated &#34;I didn&#39;t get sore, but it just seemed like maybe a few days ago it seemed like a sharp pain was coming from the side of my back and shooting to my left breast (on 25Jan2021). It only does it when I am lying down and not when I am sitting down. I drank plenty of water and continue to drink plenty of water. Today, I am feeling a little down and out because of my breast (25Jan2021). My breast itself is not sore at all. It seems like maybe a muscle on the side going down of my back. There is a sharp pain when I make a turn or reach that goes to my breast. Well, if you have arthritis it could be that.&#34; She said it seemed when she moves or turns, she has a sharp pain in her left breast. The patient asked if the sharp pain she was experiencing in her left breast area were possibly her lymph nodes. She clarified her left breast was not sore, but the area behind her left breast has a pain go through it. She said it was just when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast. She said she normally doesn&#39;t sleep on her left side, but if she sleeps on her left side, the pain behind her left breast was better. She said she does not have big breasts and was not wearing a bra when she had the pain in her left breast area. She said she was wondering if the pain she has is from her lymph nodes or muscles in her back. She said the pain was either from something in her left shoulder, or the left side of her back, or a muscle. As treatment, patient reported that she has been holding her left breast area when she moves. She said holding the left breast area helps lessen the pain, but the pain was still there. She said she has been trying to troubleshoot her pain. She said she drinks coffee every day and thought maybe she was drinking too much caffeine. She said she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night, so she turns the heat off in her house at midnight, but her house was still warm (70 degrees) when she wakes up in the morning. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather got into her back and left shoulder. She said she checked her left breast for lumps and didn&#39;t find any lumps. She said the only thing left for her to do was to contact her gynecologist and go have a mammogram. She doesn&#39;t take any medicine. She said she does take something for sleep as needed, but she would have to be going without sleep for a long time before she would take that medicine. She reported she is otherwise a healthy person. She said people talk about hormones changes after when a person used to have a period, and she sometimes doesn&#39;t know if her pain would be because of that. She said she may have irritation in her breasts from wearing a bra that may be too tight, but the pain she was experiencing now was different from that pain. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of the events she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night and feeling a little down and out was unknown; and not recovered outcome for the other events.

                                                First dose of vaccine 1/7.  Had acupuncture on 1/26.  That evening began having migraine.  three days later and still having severe headache felt bumps on scalp.  three more days later still had headache and bumps in several places.  Forehead (hairline), eye brow, eyelid.   Went to emergency room in Fl.  The Dr. gave med a cocktail to get rid of headache and also diagnosed me with Shingles.   I don&#39;t know if this was the result of 1st dose vaccine or may have been triggered by the acupuncture.    I have not had Shingles before.

Did a telemed appointment with her physician who told her to take one dose of the Epi-Pen, Benadryl, Prednisone, Ventolin, and Singulair.  These medications have worn off, and wants her to take even more doses of the Prednisone, Benadryl and the inhaler.  She is still having symptoms, but improving.  She does not itch as badly.  Her arm is sore.

                                                When I cough it was blood in that cough couple of times; Left leg swell up from my feet to all the way up; When I woke up, I didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing; I was all confused; Feeling achy/ body ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID vaccine), lot no. EL347, via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a health department because she was at high risk and she was 73. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient had an injection done 2 weeks, not this last Friday, the Friday before that. They had to make her wait for half an hour before she left and she was okay. Then Saturday (23Jan2021), she started feeling achy but to she was okay. Then Sunday (24Jan2021), she had a very bad experience, she went and start watching TV and she fell asleep. When she woke up, she didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing. And she looked at the time on her TV and it said 6:45, she didn&#39;t know if it was am or pm. And it was dark outside and she didn&#39;t know if it was Monday or Sunday. She was all confused, she called someone to make sure what day and time and all and still she was still confused. And then she had to call her aunt and then she told her no it&#39;s Sunday and it&#39;s night time and so on. Then she got better. Then during the week she didn&#39;t have that much body ache, she expected that because that was in that papers. Then today is Sunday, Friday morning (29Jan2021) she got up and she coughed, when she coughed it was blood in that cough couple of times. Then her daughter came over and took her to the hospital (hospitalization details were not clarified). She had lab work the day they took her in the emergency room. At the hospital, they did all kind of tests, on top of that her leg, her left leg swelled up from her feet to all the way up, all the way up. They thought that it could have been some blood clot. And they took test and all and nothing, everything was okay. They couldn&#39;t find out why her whole leg was swollen. On top of that, they did chest x-ray and they did something else she can&#39;t remember, another test. And they took all kind of blood work and all. And they did to see if she had the virus, the COVID. And yesterday they called her from the hospital and they said that she didn&#39;t have the virus. And she asked them about the blood work and they told her if there was anything more than they would call her. So, she thinks all this came from that injection. She called because this was not guaranteed if this was from injection. When confirmed that COVID test was negative and blood work report was not out, she stated they haven&#39;t called her that meant her blood work was okay. The swollen leg has been gone down and blood once in a while she sees a little bit. They gave her 2 prescriptions, one was antibiotic and one is steroid. Due date for the next shot is 12Feb2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Got the vaccine and within 30-an hour she was seated, waiting and she developed a tingling/numbness on her bottom lip to the center of her lip.  It spread throughout the entire bottom lip.  Then it moved to the left hand corner of her mouth as well, and then moved up to the left side of her face to her eye, and then to the corner of the left hand of her head.  This is a tingly pressure, and it then developed into a hard headache concentrated in one spot.  She went into heavy sweating.  The pharmacist was watching her and came over to her, she was there for about an hour and a half.  She had a bottle of water trying to cool off, and her tongue was getting a bad taste in her mouth, and numbness in the back of her tongue.  The pharmacist gave her Benadryl to take and she sat there for a while and was starting to feel really shaky, and she thought she would go back to her apartment to get out of being around other people.  She was feeling weak to walk, and overwhelmingly tired.  Once she did get into her apartment she her taste buds felt dry.   After several days of this reaction, little by little it subsided, but the sweating and chills continue even up until today, 3/26/21.  She goes to bed dry and wakes up soaked from sweat due to profuse sweating.  She has been yawing a lot lately and if she does yawn she immediately has chills.  It&#39;s been back and forth with the chills/fever.  She can be perspiring on one end and the other end cold.  She tried to talk to her doctor but told her to seek out UC for her symptoms as he is too busy.    There is eye strain that is bothering her which leads her into wanting to sleep and sleeps for extended periods of time and really exhausted.  Has also had runny nose, hands and feet swelling.  Her right hand is kind of like a tingling/weakness sensation.

I took Prednisone and Naprosyn, wore wrist splint with no relief.  I then saw my Rheumatologist on April 12, 2021 at 7:45 a.m.  By that time, it finally started to improve so it was decided to let it run its course without further treatment with instruction if no improvement or symptoms worsen, to return for re-exam.

Great fatigue so I did not get out of bed for 48 hours.  Muscle pains in lower legs,  and then what I would describe as little lumps, singly and in groups, along down the length of my shin bones.  It looked like a drawing of the lymph system , from knee to ankle.  This disappeared by  April 1.  Fatigue was present for 2 more days..  Some mornings I still feel fatigue on arising.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

The clinical course was reported as follows:  Consumer reported that 2 hours after receiving the first vaccine dose, she experienced headache, fever, chills, nausea, and diarrhea. Fever &#34;went away&#34; by Monday (22Mar2021) morning. Consumer asked, will she have the same or worse symptoms in the second dose. She is not pregnant at the time of vaccination.

AM. Resumed ADLs Tues. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. No covid tested post vaccination. No other vaccine in four weeks. Her personal physician recommended she not receive second shot. There were two reasons. One was that she had COVID in early Dec2020, and she received the monoclonal antibodies. The side effects she had after first shot were robust. Based on that information, it was his medical opinion for her not to receive the second shot. She has not been able to get that opinion. Does Pfizer have any recommendation for getting second dose after having COVID and receiving monoclonal antibodies? She had the COVID prior to getting the vaccine. She was given the monoclonal antibodies on day 5 after symptoms and day 4 after the positive PCR test.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Dizziness started the next day and progressively got severe trying not to bump into things.  The dizziness lasted for a few weeks and progressed into weird feelings in her legs as if they were &#34;jelly&#34;.  She was losing feeling in them and had trouble walking.   She was also progressively losing feeling in her hands and had numbness.  On 4/2 she had a bad fall due to her legs totally giving out.  She was taken to the hospital and released for bad sprain and bruising.  We went to her primary doctor to report her condition also.  I asked him to report about her condition and he had no idea what the VAERS database was.  A week after the fall she wasn&#39;t getting any better.  She was losing control of more of her body.  On 4/19 an ambulance took her to Hospital  and they did tests for a week and couldn&#39;t find what it was.  When she was transfered to another hospital she was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  She was there for a week and is now in a nursing home and has no ability to walk or use her arms.

The patient presents with Nausea and vomiting. A 73 year old female with a history of UTI and DM was brought to the ED today due to having nausea and vomiting for the past couple of days. She was administered Zofran by EMS; they checked her BS which was 171. The patient states she has been sick since the eighth of this month, and has had diarrhea, dysuria, and  arm pain. She reports not taking her insulin since February due to her insurance no longer covering her. .  The onset was 3  days ago.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is unknown.  The degree at present is moderate.  The exacerbating factor is none.  The relieving factor is none.  Risk factors consist of diabetes mellitus. Therapy today: emergency medical services.  Associated symptoms: diarrhea.  4/30/21: A 73-year-old female, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 with chronic kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency from renal cell carcinoma and adrenalectomy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with portal hypertension, esophageal varices, has had nausea and vomiting for several days.  She did receive her second COVID-19 vaccination on April 8, and has had ongoing symptoms since that time, much worse in the 3 days prior to admission. An initial COVID screen was negative, but rechecking the PCR COVID test was positive.  Initially, she did not require any oxygen, but did require 2 L nasal cannula at night on the second night, at which time remdesivir and convalescent plasma were administered.  She was also given dexamethasone, but had marked rise in her blood sugar to greater than 400. The dexamethasone was tapered and stopped.  Glucose regulated with insulin.  The patient initially had severe anorexia, poor oral intake, but this slowly improved.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis has shown the small nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  There is some ascites and mild pleural effusions.  The patient had been receiving some IV fluids, and we would discontinue the Lasix because of low blood pressure.  There was no other obvious explanation for her poor oral intake or abdominal pain. The patient had IV access problems and eventually, despite the PICC line and midlines being attempted, we were unable to complete a successful IV to finish her CAP antibiotics or the remdesivir. The patient seemed to be doing better, oxygen is 98% on room air, blood pressure 98/63 and 116/60.  We are holding the Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.  The glucose has been running at 213, 154, and 202.  BUN at 35, creatinine 1.4.  WBC 11,700 and hemoglobin 11.5. The patient was seen on the day of discharge at 1100 hours, doing quite well, and will be discharged home with her family.  We have offered visiting nurses, but she feels that the family is there 24 hours a day.  She does not need any visiting nurses.  We have made some changes to her medications, and she will need to follow up with her primary doctor in the next week to see whether we need to restart Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Will be hydrocortisone 15 mg a.m., 5 mg evening, venlafaxine 37.5 daily, venlafaxine 150 mg at bedtime, rifaximin 550 mg b.i.d., Bactrim DS 1 daily, multivitamins daily, insulin glargine 35 units at bedtime, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, NovoLog 20 units before meals.  Again, we are holding Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.

                                                After 1st vaccine injection (3/4/21 L-arm), I developed a sudden and continuous itching of left arm, shoulder, left side toward my back that last about 1 and 1/2 days. I looked up COVID 19 symptoms and found that symptoms could arise after 3 to 7 days so I reported to my pharmacist but was not alarmed and neither was he. The soreness from the first injection (L arm) got a little worse with some swelling instead of better (like a flu shot w/o swelling ) but I was not really alarmed about that either at the time. I received my 2nd COVID 19 Injection 3/25/21 (Rt arm) and had mild soreness, swelling and fatigue (I sleep almost nonstop for 3 days) but nothing out of the ordinary with this 2nd vaccine. Then noticing the difference between the Left and Right arms, my left arm was more swollen and much more tender than the right arm. For the record and because joint pain is also a side effect of the vaccine, I noticed other changes to my left upper extremity but ignored these changes due to my chronic pain history until the pain became unbearable. They are: Sudden and severe pain in left thumb radiating up the inside of my arm/wrist; I was unable to grab or hold unto objects (cups, silverware, dishes, etc.). Off and on, this pain and swelling continued up into my left arm along with the periodic bouts of itching in my injection site. I mentioned and showed it to my pharmacist and he suggested I report it as soon as possible. Having trouble obtaining a readable copy of the VAERS form, I went to an Urgent Care Center after waking up and could not move my arm (slept on it all night). Because of my health history and a Rotator Cup injury in June 2016, they contributed my current problem to that shoulder injury; they mentioned nothing of my report about the symptoms after the COVID 19 Vaccine. I was sent for X-Rays and MRI of my left arm/shoulder and referred to an Orthopedic Surgeon (Dr.  who recommended a complete shoulder replacement. By the time of my appointment with him, I was using my arm with little to moderate pain, taking Protonics and Meloxicam and using ice packs as needed for pain (there were multiple days I went without pain meds but tenderness and swelling still apparent). I am a little skeptical about there diagnosis of it being related to my old rotator cup injury (6-2016) because, the pains are different: 1. the original injury resulted in a frozen arm with no movement until couple months of therapy, in which I regain full use of my arm until the first dose of my COVID 19 Vaccine (3/4/21). As mentioned because of my Chronic Pain History, I am not quick to seek medical attention unless the pain appears to me, to be out of the ordinary scope of my pain. Therefore, I am reporting this out of concern of the ongoing soreness/swelling in the L-Arm Vaccine Site ( much greater than rt arm) and wondering if this soreness/swelling and warm to touch, could be a reaction to the COVID 19 Injection, which could be causing an old injury to flare up (maybe inflammation). Lastly, following the development of the Pifzer and Moderna Vaccine, it was recently reported that some teenagers that received the vaccine had developed Myocarditis, inflammation of a heart muscle and/or inflammation around the Pericardium of the heart and were [complaining of chest pain]. At the age of 73, I have a healthy heart history without medications other than the baby asprin but have also felt these symptoms [in my chest and breast] since taking the vaccines. Some of the pain is sudden and forceful until it stop me in my tracks; I have increase my aspirin because of this.  I am a former smoker but quit Feb 2013. I have also had my yearly mammogram and had a normal reading.  In summary, I believe my symptoms might be a result of the vaccine as it relates to joint pain, swelling, and inflammation but don&#39;t understand why it is lasting so long. I am also following up with healthcare providers to make certain that I don&#39;t have other developing health issues. Therefore, I look forward to hearing from CDC and hope this information helps me, as well as, your efforts to perfect the vaccines and keeping the public safe.

Later on I realized that it didn&#39;t get smaller my leg started to get bigger. So I called  the doctor and they advised me to come in immediately to do an ultrasound. They later on told me that the swelling was  due to a blood clot that formed and they prescribed Xarelto 15 mg 2x day and with that prescription I didn&#39;t see any improvement so they prescribed me to do 20mg 1x day and I&#39;m just now seeing results now.

Reaction continued to get worse until day 12.  It is now day 15 and much improved but still present.  2. Noticed having some difficulty swallowing on the 3-4 day.  Did not have problems with swallowing foods,  only when trying to swallow small amounts of liquid , such as accumulated saliva.  I had to consciously engage muscles to gulp or get more liquid to get it down.   The problem is improved now at day 15.

                                                I had some of the listed side effects. i.e., pain and redness at injection site and fatigue. However, by Feb 21  noticed swelling under my armpit on the left side as well as somewhat swollen nodes in the left side of my neck. The swelling under my arm became worse over the next two days. When I raised my left arm I felt considerable pain. Over the next 2 days I also had swelling in my left forearm near bend in my elbow. I also had a rash the size of a patch above the injection site.  I looked this issue up online and found reports that approximately 16% of women who had received the 2nd Covid shot experienced swelling under the armpit. I contacted my doctor by e mail .  I switched from taking tylelnol to advil.  All side effects are gone except there is still a little swelling in armpit.  I contacted my Doctor and will see her on March 15th if the swelling is not gone.

Also, it was hurting under her arm when she was lifting. She experienced something like that before with a Flu vaccine. She noticed when she looked it up, the information states, yes.

Went to bed, and woke up and her arm is swollen, it&#39;s like she has a frozen shoulder, is pounding pain, extremely tight, difficult to move, can&#39;t move it, and very constricted which prevents her from using it.   The pain goes all the way down to her elbow.  She cannot use the left hand, and when she tries to move her arm at the elbow has excruciating pain.   She took 2 Tylenol which helped, but the pain comes back when it&#39;s time for more Tylenol and is also taking Ibuprofen but the symptoms are still there.  Just to lift her arm up to put on the arms of a chair is painful with no mobility in the arm.

                                                She received her 2nd vaccine and started feeling very chilled and tired around 6:30 that evening, started shaking and feeling like restlessness.  She went to bed and covered up under lots of covers, and just froze.  She put on extra clothes, layers of blankets and her legs felt swollen, painful.  She kept having to urinate a lot, could not sleep, was awake all night, her arm started hurting as well, could not lay on that side, and then started getting cold/hot flashes.  She felt as though her heart was racing, and her brain as well trying to figure out what was happening.  Her husband took her temperature in the morning and it was 101.9, which her normal is 97.9.  At that point she was exhausted from being up all night, and was frightening and couldn&#39;t stop trembling all night long into Saturday.  When day broke on Saturday shew as not able to get out of bed for the entire day.  She could not eat, had no appetite and drank water day.  On Sunday she felt a little better, ate breakfast and the rest of the day went okay other than being exhausted.  This morning, 3/22/21, she still feels lofty, is able to function and feels a little removed/foggy feeling.   She is still not feeling completely well, but is on her way.  Not steady on her feet yet.   She took some Bayer aspirin for the symptoms.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number EL9265, Expiration Date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 03-FEB-2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization.

She had arthritis in her knees and her knees started hurting real bad but she didn&#39;t think much of it then all of a sudden, everything started going, her arms, she could not raise her arms she couldn&#39;t make a fist. She couldn&#39;t do anything with her fingers. Her lymph node swelled and it made her throat hurt and her feet hurt, everything, all her joints in her body hurt. That was when she knew it wasn&#39;t arthritis when it was her shoulders and arms she knew she does not have arthritis there and it took her a while to figure it out. She felt bad and her husband was concerned about her and she told him maybe its the COVID shot and he didn&#39;t think it would be that, he thought it was just her arthritis and she got her paper out from the first shot and it listed joint pain, she had the joint pain, tiredness, and swollen gland. later it was relaxed a little. It was a whole week for her, she has a hard enough time with regular arthritis. It almost froze  her, it almost made her feel frozen. She was up all night she couldn&#39;t sleep, she was miserable she was up and down, up and down. She was cat napping, she would fall asleep and then it would wake her up. They haven&#39;t changed any meds and she didn&#39;t have any problem. Nothing was new it was not any medications that she has taken. She confirms that her lymph node in her neck was swollen and it made her throat hurt when she swallows, that was gone down now. It was starting to go away it is not all the way gone but she can live with it now. The outcome of event was recovering.  Description of complaint: The patient reported her experience after the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She reported that she had join pain all over. She says her doctor&#39;s office was closed because the doctor was under quarantine. She definitely would&#39;ve gone to see him to  beg him to give her something for pain because Aspirin was not doing it. No further information provided.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 2/10/21, approx 11:50 am.  I went home and in the early afternoon decided to take a nap in recliner.  When I work up &lt;2 hr later, my left hand was completely blue (like veins in my hand but all over).  Thinking that was really weird, a began to shake my hand.  It went back to normal skin color relatively quickly.  No other side effects from vaccine that day.  On 3/10/22 I saw my ob/gyn for annual check.  She said I had swollen lymph nodes under my left arm (injection arm) and they were finding that to be a side effect of Pfizer vaccine.  She noted that on mammogram orders.  I had no other side effects. NOTE:   Vaccine record card for 1st vaccine on 1/18/21 says my patient number

A 74-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm on 27Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient was diagnosed with glaucoma about a year or a little over a year, prediabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Concomitant medication(s) included simvastatin (SIMVASTATIN) 40 mg once daily taken for cholesterol, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) 20 mg once daily by mouth taken for blood pressure; metformin (METFORMIN) 30 mg once daily taken for diabetes; timolol (TIMOLOL) taken for diabetes, dorzolamide hydrochloride (DORZOLOMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE) taken for glaucoma. After vaccination from that day until now (11Feb2021), patient still has pain on the injection site. She wanted to know if that is usual. She is concerned because she had heard that the AEs from the second dose are worse than from the first dose. Patient family doctor didn&#39;t want to entertain her concern. Her doctor said that she should refer to the one who gave the vaccine which is from the County in (State). Patient couldn&#39;t believe her doctor wouldn&#39;t want to take care of me since he said my AE is related to the vaccine. This was the weirdest thing she had from her doctor.Patient called and stated that she was am a person who received the Pfizer vaccine 16 days ago and she was experiencing still sore muscles in the arm where it was given she could not bend my arm as far as she use to be able to she cannot flex it toward her shoulders and its she just talked to her doctor&#39;s office where she told them sahe was having some adverse effects from the shot. Patient was calling to see if got any same reports of peoples whose arms got stiff, muscles are stiff, can&#39;t flex, sore, even like she say she was now 16 days after the injection she think that&#39;s a little bit long to still be feeling something. Patient also mentioned she was beginning to wonder if she going to get rid of this soreness in her arm or is that something permanent. Patient explained further when she first got it she did experience localized pain, I did not experience fever, did experience though shivering or chills but kind of thought that was because it was chilly but it might have been from the vaccine now that she think about it but she was not sure mostly it was the soreness in my arm that&#39;s her main concern is this lingering soreness in the arm after 16 days she had the injection on the 27Jan. At end of call mentioned she had seen the general side effects and may have experienced a few more other than this one but this is the one that&#39;s still with her not being able to utilize my left arm like she was used to be able to do even just reaching up to a cabinet for something in a higher cabinet or something she can&#39;t do that without feeling she was going to drop what she was reaching for and its sore its sore to do it. Reaching for a skillet down below in a lower cabinet it&#39;s like no it&#39;s not going to work or getting a gallon of milk out of the refrigerator I almost dropped it. So she feel like what was going on here I should be over this by now she can&#39;t, with both arm she use to be able to bend at the elbow and touch my shoulder well she cannot still can with my right arm but with the left arm she can&#39;t do that. She like 2 inches from being able to touch my shoulder. Fixing her hair she can&#39;t reach back behind my head very easily its with pain and effort to brush and she was left handed so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have gotten it in my left arm here I am 16 days later and she still feel like I can&#39;t utilize my arm like she use to be able to not totally disabled but know its disability in it and its annoying the pain was annoying even taking Ibuprofen.Patient really didn&#39;t have much effects, a little bit of chills but they were having cold weather, she was from (State) so she might get a chill if she opens up the windows. She really had no significant adverse effects at first except soreness in the arm, she says of the things recanted on the internet, she didn&#39;t have fever, she may have had some chills but she was lethargic, she didn&#39;t feel like doing anything, so she guesses she would say tiredness for the first day or so but what bothers her is that was 27Jan and she still does not have full use of the arm in movement. The arm used to be able to, without hesitation, reach behind her head to brush her hair or reach to fix her necklaces those things she couldn&#39;t do and she would say oh goodness what is going on. She has pain if she tries to force it and she thought well she will exercise to limber it up. She is not having continual pain like if she leaves her arm down comfortably but trying to do activity like reaching up to her shoulder or her neck or behind her head. She couldn&#39;t do that she would say the last few days it has been a little bit better but there is still pain there. Her vaccine card is in her purse she is going to be going go to the appointment in a couple of days and it scares her because she don&#39;t want to have her arm on the other side hurt, if she gets she was going to ask them to put it on the other side but she doesn&#39;t want to go through this again and what if it is permanent and both arms are then disabled she would rather have one of them working than both of them. Prior to the injection, her arm had no problem. She states she cannot touch her shoulder anymore and is unable to reach behind her neck to latch a necklace. She states now, she feels discomfort in her forearm and not as much in the upper arm. She states sometimes the pain goes into her hand; she states while she is quietly watching tv, she notices some throbbing going into her hand. She&#39;s not affected by arthritis and things like that and she&#39;s had pretty good health. She has gotten the flu and pneumonia shot and any other injections with no problem. She had a comfortable initial stick when she received the COVID vaccine with no particular pain at the time of injection. She stated she did not want to do anything for 2 days and was really tired with a stiff and sore arm. She called the doctor after 2 weeks and was not able to get ahold of a doctor. Caller is wondering if there have been reports of duration of this side effect for this long and whether or not she should receive the second shot. The outcome of the events not resolved for injection site pain and myalgia and unknown for rest of the events.

                                                1st Dose: fever, aches, very painful joints, could not walk for one day due to severe knee pain. 2nd Dose: COVID arm, sharp stabbing pain beginning in left armpit to left breast nipple and entire breast, Dramatic increase in heart palpitations. Both of the latter two symptoms lasted until April 1st @ 1pm when the both subsided at the same time. I visited my breast care center and 6  weeks after the vaccination an ultrasound was completed revealing a swollen lymph node at level 3 - still within normal limits. A second ultrasound is scheduled 1 month after the first ultrasound. No further palpitations other than what I usually experience - very few.

The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history was reported as none. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was not provided), administered on left arm on 17Mar2021 03:30PM as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. There were no concomitant medications. It was roughly 3 days after the second shot (10Apr2021) that the patient experienced severe leg pain in the morning. She was unable to walk for about an hour after waking up. Her physician did blood test and her c-reactive protein was 283. Her white blood cell count was also very high. She was nauseous and unable to eat. The extreme leg pain has since subsided but she still cannot eat. She has lost 17lbs. It has been a month of this and she&#39;s had every test known to man. The patient was hospitalized for 1 day due to severe leg pain, unable to walk and white blood cell count high on an unspecified date. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 antibody test (Nasal swab): negative on 21Apr2021. The outcome of severe leg pain, unable to walk and white blood cell count high was not recovered; and unknown for the other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported events  and the use of  BNT162B2 seems unlikely. The limited information available precludes a more meaningful assessment. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                She got her vaccine, had no reaction.  She told them that she had a problem with apples and they made her stay for an additional 30  minutes, and was feeling okay and they went home.  Then about 3-4 weeks and she woke up one morning, and her mouth was swollen like she had an overdose of Botox all the way around.  Then it seemed like it was moving and half of her lip swelling was gone.  She got on Benadryl right away and then she thought maybe she had eaten something that she was allergic to, had some fruit thinking that maybe it was in a container of fruit as that&#39;s reaction she had with applies.  They called the doctor and he wasn&#39;t in, but a NP saw her and she gave her a shot of steroids and put her on the steroid dose pack.  It took about 4-5 days and then it started clearing up and it was gone.  Then all of a sudden 3 weeks later her face started swelling up, the jaw area was swelling up and it moved around.  She went to the ER and was given another prescription for the steroid dose pack and was told to take Benadryl.  Then it went away again.  Then it started happening another day, her left eye was closing up completely and the eyebrow went all the way up and was swollen.  For the first month or so it was in her face.  They went to visit some friends in Arizona for a week and she was fine.  Then, she started with her forehead swelling and she thought it may have been he sun, but she does not stay in the sun long as she covers her head, this lasted about 2 days and went away.  Then they went home and she called him again and said that she had the reaction again on her face and her forehead and the top of her head in her hairline.  In between this she saw an allergist and tested her and said that she had no allergy to apples, other fruits and nuts, and informed her that her blood work was fine.  Then again, just recently 4 days ago she then broke into a rash, her forehead was rosy and her chest was red and itching.  She saw her doctor and he gave her another allergist for her to see and referred her then, but has not seen that doctor yet.  The rash seems to be gone at this time, no swelling at this time, but feels terrible. She has had 4-5 outbreaks since the vaccine, and they continue to keep happening, but in different areas every time.   She is okay for today.

Her arm was sore for 24 hours. A week later her arm was swollen and had a red area and it itched. She called Pfizer a week ago yesterday. She didn&#39;t know why it was so long for that reaction. They told her it could be seven to eight days for that reaction. It was like that for 4 days. Yesterday morning she woke up and it was itching and swollen, but it was not as swollen as it was previously. There was a pinkish red area. It came back again after 2 weeks. Her concern is whether she can get the vaccine. She could get it in the other arm. She is supposed to get the second vaccine on 18Mar2021 considering her recurrence of injection site swelling and soreness.

She got a letter yesterday from Pfizer that said she filed a complaint. She doesn&#39;t consider it a complaint, but considers it a concern. Reference number: 5709643.

That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

                                                I had two symptoms that are normal, they were on the list of side effects, I had soreness on my left arm, I couldn&#39;t sleep on my left arm due to this soreness. This started the day the soreness started. The following day and up till now I felt very tired and like I needed to take a nap. Due to work I have not been able to nap. On Sunday I noticed I had a fever blister on the right side of face, under my lip by my chin. It looked like a herpes blister. I rarely get them unless there is a serious stressor to my body or if my body is emotionally stressed. Valacyclozir I took 4 of those in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening after noticing them. I put a cream on the blister. On Tuesday or Wednesday 3 or 4 days after the vaccine I felt a pain in my gum by back two teeth, the gums were very painful when I brushed my teeth or put my tongue on it.  I went to the dentist Friday the 22nd, however the dentist said it was intraoral herpes that he believes it is looked to the vaccine. Dr. believes the COVID vaccine activated the dormant herpes in my system . He said says it is located over the Greater Palatine Foramen.  The herpes on my chin went away. I still feel light sensitivity and fatigued. Dr recommended to see my dermatologist. Either the 22nd or 23rd I had a virutal appointment with my dermatologist. She recommended I take 4 Valacyclozir in the AM and PM. And then 1 day for 10 days. Both doctors recommended not getting the 2nd dose until the herpes vaccine goes away. Once it goes away they suggested taking the Valacyclozir before taking the 2nd dose. I am still not feeling normal. My dentist said he was going to consult a group of dentists to see if any other dentists have seen the correlation between the COVID vaccine and activating the herpes virus.  I plan to consult my PCP about if I should delay the 2nd dose.

                                                I began feeling deeply fatigued and achy about six hours after the vaccination and went to bed.  The aches and fatigue continued the next day and evening and, additionally, I had a swelling in my left wrist of the arm that I had the shot in.  That swelling was painful; it  was about an inch across and looked like it contained fluid.  All those symptoms continued for two more days and then the swelling began to subside and is now gone..  Today, the morning of the fifth day after the vaccination, I awoke at 3 a.m. with severe body aches, took two Tylenol and eventually was able to sleep again.  I am feeling better but very, very tired and have some bodyaches and headache but not as severe.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

                                                Had my 2nd dose last Saturday, Feb. 20, at Hospital, Toledo, Ohio.  Had both injections in my left arm.  Noticed my left arm was sore at the injection site and now my arm is red and a bit swollen from my shoulder to my elbow, plus a little itchy but no rash.  Was taking Tylenol and icing it until my friend told me not to ice it.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 75-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included reverse total shoulder replacement on 26Jan2021, cardiomyopathy from an unknown date, and type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received her shingles shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and flu shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both in Oct2020 for immunization and had no reactions.  On 05Feb2021 at 16:00, the patient experienced hives and itching. On 05Feb2020, the patient had blotches, blistering, swollen hands, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands. The clinical course was as follows: She had absolutely no problem at the time of the injection, no soreness with it she was fine and then she had welts starting with 2-3 then all over her body, that were itching terribly. They stared on the left wrist, both hands. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); but it did not help. The patient then went to the emergency room (ER). By the time she got to the ER, the hives moved up to her abdomen and she was covered in big blistery looking raisings and few small raises on her trunk and arms. The hives were concentrated from her fingers to her elbow, and then there were other blotches on her elbows to her fingers that were real concentrated. She stayed at the hospital for 3 hours, but she was not admitted. At the ER, she received pantoprazole (PROTONIX), diphenhydramine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine (ATARAX) and prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient also stated that her hands were so swollen after getting the dose of the vaccine that she couldn&#39;t get them closed and she had cracking creases with serous fluid coming out of both hands. The swelling went down a little bit the next day; but she still had the blotches. She said the itch was tolerated. However, the blistering started again. Her doctor put her on a sliding scale of prednisone and diphenhydramine at 25 mg every 6 hours. The clinical outcome of the swelling hands was recovering; while that of the blotches and blisters were not recovered. The clinical outcomes of the hives, itching, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands were unknown. The patient assessed the events to be medically significant as she had never experienced anything like this.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine facility type was reported as the &#34;doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.&#34; Relevant medical history included high blood pressure, but it was controlled blood pressure/hypertension; asthma, for which she was not taking medication at the time of the report, because it was under control; non allergic rhinitis; pre diabetes; and a little overweight. The patient further stated that she had just general medical history, which she had everything under control. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and metformin. The patient previously took to iodine, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromycin, for which the patient had known allergies to all of it. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient stated that on 12Jan2021 at 10:30, she had adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine; she had severe allergic reaction within about 30 minutes and then they call the paramedic she ended up and they gave her a shot, which she did not know if it was prednisone. It was further reported that she took her inhaler too as they said she was wheezing, which she didn&#39;t really feel in her lungs. The patient just felt that what happen was she went to the car as they said to wait 15 minutes as written, and she always follow the rules and the whole thing they said, she waited 30 minutes, so she went down side of her car then she figured that she could just drive off drive home. So, she was in car sitting or waiting for the last 30 minutes and all of a sudden she felt right through her chest like through her right side kind of going into her left; it was weird like she could feel going into her body, then suddenly her heart start beating really fast, and then she pulled down the vizor and looked in the rearview mirror and her face was all red, so she go back to the site. That&#39;s how she transpired and then, that&#39;s how the reaction was. It was further reported that the patient waited 15 minutes in the office, then went to car to wait additional 15 minutes, and suddenly felt strange sensation in her chest and her heart started beating very rapidly. She pulled down the visor in car and saw her face growing red and swelling slightly and her breathing was becoming labored. She had read on side effects on information she was given on departure stating symptoms of an allergic reaction. She returned to the facility at which time she was treated. The adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no investigation assessment. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included that the patient was given a shot of 125 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), but another report said they gave her prednisone so they were kind of conflicting in the report, but it was a shot, and also cetirizine (ZYRTEC) and famotidine (PEPCID), and her inhaler for wheezing. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.

The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

                                                At 12:30a.m. I awoke after the shot to shooting pain on the left side of my head that would last for seconds and continue every few minutes.  My arm was hurting a lot also, but I expected that.  I took an Ibuprophen but it continued now coming every 10 minutes.  My son told me to take 3 ibuprofen at a time every 4 hours that allowed me to go back to sleep.  When I awoke I continued the ibuprofen but in the afternoon I was getting the shooting pains in my left ear.  SO I continued the ibuprofen.  On Sunday m72 hours after the shot my arm was so swollen and red with pain and itching.  I called my doctor and she said to take ibuprofen and come in if it is not better on Monday.

                                                arthritis; fingers on right were all swollen; she could barely move her arm; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient.  A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 10:40 (at the age of 75-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included arthritis from an unknown date, renal cancer since 07Dec2020 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation since 2006 and ongoing,  partial nephrectomy on 06 Jan2021. She specified that she has an arthritis flare up about once a year and normally takes a Medrol dose pack.  The patient&#39;s historical vaccines included an unspecified flu vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) on an unspecified date about ten years ago after which she had to go to the Emergency Room for right arm redness, swelling at the injection site and face swelling on right side. She did not get another flu shot for 10 years but did get one this year in Nov2020. Concomitant medication included metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), flecainide acetate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reports that she experienced a light headache. She clarified that she is in an unspecified program which includes an e-diary. As part of that program (app) she was sent a text every day for a week asking if she had any side effects; a couple times she had a headache.  On the eighth day (03Feb2021) she had a reaction where her right hand and wrist was painful and swollen. Caller states she couldn&#39;t move her hand without pain. Caller states she put ice on her hand Wednesday evening and this helped a little.  When ice was on her hand it helped with the pain but when it was removed it came back. She also reported fingers on right were all swollen and that she does have arthritis.  She further described the events as on Wednesday she started getting a little pain in her right wrist joint. She does have arthritis, but this pain was stronger, and her hand and fingers on right were all swollen in comparison to her other hand, and her knuckles seemed bigger. States that the pain got very strong and by the next morning she could barely move her arm; even though it was only her wrist that hurt, moving any part of her arm made her wrist her more, so she started icing it and took Tylenol for Arthritis 650mg Extended Release; she took it twice, one each time and reported that it probably didn&#39;t work. Caller clarifies statement about it probably not working; stating that she didn&#39;t notice a difference after taking the Tylenol.  She asked if these events, occurring eight days after the vaccine could be vaccine side effects or is this just a flare up on her arthritis that is unrelated to the vaccine. She added that she had been doing a lot of &#34;chopping&#34; while cooking on the night that this happened so that may have caused the flare up. She has a Medrol pack on hand for things like this (4mg tablets). She started it today and took two tablets before breakfast and one tablet at lunch. She states that it has already made a difference in her pain. She stated her concern, however, which is that she found that taking a steroid could affect the vaccine if taken before getting the vaccine, and right now she is in-between the two doses.  Her second dose is scheduled for 16Feb2021. She inquired as to if she can finish this dose pack without messing up the vaccine. The clinical outcome of headache was reported as recovered. The clinical outcomes of  hand swelling, wrist pain, hand pain and swelling of wrists were reported as not recovered. The clinical outcomes of arthritis flare up, swelling of fingers and could not move her arm were unknown.

I haven&#39;t had a cold sore in many, many years and have only gotten one if I have been in the sun too long or have a high fever.  I called the doctor on call the following morning  and asked for a prescription of acyclovir. Starting it that late resulted in not stopping the progression of the cold sore. Also had runny nose (haven&#39;t had a cold since masking started last year), and a red swollen arm..still red and swollen two days later and a terrible headache (started the day after injection and still bad today which is two days after).

As later confirmed that the vaccination card contains incorrect information, this Lot number belongs to a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, instead of Moderna&#39;s vaccine (as documented). Agent mentioned the patient &#34;had some side effects from the vaccine&#34;. The patient explained that the vaccination center was administering COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, the documentation error may have repeated in other patients.  Patient stated that &#34;when I talked to the girl am I getting a Moderna and my son heard her say yes, and I said - Okay. Now that day they are doing second shot on Moderna and the first shots on the Pfizer. Here she was telling me twice that I have got Moderna, but it&#39;s written on card here that I got a Pfizer. She actually put me on Moderna time frame not on Pfizer. I should have had the shot if I was on Pfizer. I think she was thinking that it was Moderna shot and that my time laps would, the question is, I am out 30 some days&#34;. The patient stated she had some side effects after her shot. She did have some fever, the little bit of chills, the headache. She did get a lump under her arm of the site where the shot was given. And that&#39;s fine, she knew that a lymph node was down more there than it was other. She had already talked to her doctor and was told that when she was going next Monday to get the other shot, just shoot the other arm. So, that&#39;s rectified. Patient stated probably right after, her arm about 4-5 days, after, maybe up to a week, she got a feeling of warm herself, but after 3 to 4 days her arm started getting sore, she noticed the lump coming under her left arm where she (incomplete sentence). Treatment included patient had hot water on it. She was not doing much anymore. She was taking Tylenol for probably a week or week and half between here, and that probably did help. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

                                                cellulitis; Bacterial skin infection; right arm where I got the injection turning all red and swollen; arm swelling; bursitis; Muscle pain; joint pain in elbow; the bruise have been flamed; Feeling hot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) at the age of 75-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic type 2 for probably 13-14 years, sleep apnea for 20 years (2001), arthritis in 2005 (probably 12-14 years), and blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medications included metformin, sertraline, alprazolam, sitagliptin (JANUVIA), oxybutynin, insulin glargine (LANTUS), lisinopril for blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure), and cortisone for arthritis. The patient received the vaccine on 13Mar2021 in the afternoon and within 24 to 30 hours, the next day (14Mar2021), her right arm, where the vaccine was administered turned all red and swollen and her elbow also hurt. She went to the emergency room because she felt it was a reaction to the vaccine. They told her that it was a bacterial skin infection, an adverse effect of an initial encounter to the vaccine, arm swelling and bursitis caused by that, muscle pain and join pain in elbow and then she guessed it was like cellulitis. They gave her ROCEPHIN at the emergency room and then a couple days later, it wasn&#39;t getting any better and it was all the way down to her wrist. She went to immediate care center and received an antibiotic. She was also given 2 more prescription of antibiotics and told that it had to be administered with the antibiotics to get rid of the reactions. It has finally pretty much cleared up with the antibiotics if they hadn&#39;t put her in an immediate care and put her on intravenous medications. They were really concerned because it was going to get into sepsis or something. At first, the patient thought that it was just inflamed, then it was skin infection and then adverse effect from the initial encounter of the vaccine. She had been on the antibiotics for 10 days when it finally cleared, but the elbow was still sore and it hurts a lot, but the fluid was drained by an orthopedic doctor. She was given 2 different types of antibiotics plus a shot into her buttocks. It&#39;s a little sore because she was informed that &#34;the bruise have been flamed&#34; on Mar2021. When she went to emergency, first they give her 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched antibiotic to DURICEF and to BACTRIM DS, and advised to continue monitoring and if swelling and redness was progressive or worse, then go to emergency room again. She went to emergency room on 16Mar2021, the medicine given was doxycycline and then she was seen by an orthopedic physician today where the fluid was drained from her elbow but swelling and redness was progressively getting worst and she was feeling hot on Mar2021. So, she went to the immediate care. Overall, consistent to cellulitis of right upper arm strongly includes to go to the ER but the patient had something else and had to go right then. And then, she was given 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched to DURACEF and BACTRIM. She came back to the ER on the same day. It was kind of 2 things, like the redness and skin infection which currently was cellulitis. Doxycycline was what they told her to get, that&#39;s what they gave her at the emergency room, doxycycline hyclate. And then said to follow-up with her primary care which she did and that was on 17Mar2021. She looked at it and then they told her to see an orthopedic surgeon and she saw him on the 18Mar2021. They just thought that the antibiotics, that&#39;s why he gave her 2 different prescriptions plus the shot in the buttocks because he said if this will not be cured with the antibiotics, she&#39;ll end up in a hospital. And then it was raft and it took her 10 days to recover. And he marked little black dots to show where wasn&#39;t and if it goes beyond that then call us because it was spreading. The outcome of the events bruise and feeling hot was unknown, not recovered for joint pain, and recovered on 24Mar2021 for all other events. The events required emergency room visit/ physician office visit.

A 75-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Feb2021 around 10:30 (Lot number/NDC number/Expiry date: Unknown) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization (preventative). The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 administered in left arm on 17Jan2021 around 12:00 PM as single dose for Covid-19 immunization and experienced under her arm hurt terribly under the muscle and tetanus vaccine (TETANUS SHOT). Caller stated that &#34;she was already done with the 2 doses of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. She said that she experienced side effects after getting the vaccine. She was experiencing pain in her arm and that 3 weeks after her second dose the pain went to her other arm. Every time she wanted to sit down she was having trouble going up as her glute muscle started hurting. She could not sleep, experiencing pain when lying down that felt like everything hurts as she could not bend down to pick something up. They also gave her blood test which they saw that her ESR was elevated as well as her CRP. She was asked about the same reports as that and what medication she should be taking. DSU: E-transmitting DSU as the caller ended the line before she could offer to transfer. Was not able to ask for her zip code and offer survey as caller ended the line. Clinical Trials Experience included: Table 4: Study 2, Frequency and Percentages of Participants with Solicited Systemic Reactions, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose. Participants 56 Years of Age and Older. Reactogenicity Subset of the Safety Population. Caller was the patient that wanted to know who to write or talk to about having an adverse reaction after the Covid vaccine. Caller did not explain reaction to agent. Caller was asking what to do about the reaction and agent provided number. Height: She thought she was shrunk. Reported she finally got her HCP to order blood tests for her. She finally took the necessary blood tests. Confirmed product as Pfizer Covid19 vaccine. She took the first vaccine and under her arm hurt terribly under the muscle and it lasted 2 or 3 days and then it went away. When she took the second vaccine the same thing happened, and her arm hurting lasted about 3 or 4 days. She had a very high tolerance to pain and tend to ignore things. It gave her a problem like she could not reach, it hurt when tried to reach things. About 2 or 3 weeks after the second dose both of her arms felt the same way, under the arms muscles when driving it hurt her under both of her arms. It was ongoing, it was terrible, and it got worse. She started documenting it. About 3 weeks ago, when she sat down, she could not get up, underneath her backside and the thigh muscles hurt. It was ongoing and everything seems to be getting worse. Reaching was terrible, she was not sleeping. She was having a terrible, terrible pain under her arm when she asleep and she went from bed to couch. She read that it might help to try to use a pillow when trying to get up. Stated that, the only way she could get up from bed was if she leans on a pillow. In the morning it was the worse and she could not get out of bed, like she did not have the strength to get out of bed. She was then walking, and she walked through it, her behind, it hurt. She was scared since it was gravitating from her upper arm to her lower arm. Reported that, it seems to be the same thing with her legs and could not bend down to pick something up. Everyone kept telling her it was from driving. She did not have her vaccination card to provide lot, expiration date or dosage for either dose. First dose was administered on 17Jan2021 around 12:00 PM, administered in left arm. Second dose administered on 07Feb2021 around 10:30, administered in left arm&#34;. Treatment included &#34;tried going into jacuzzi and Epsom salt baths but nothing helps. One time in the jacuzzi it seemed to get better but then the same thing happened the next day. She did not take any prescriptions. She was now concerned that the back of her neck, near the top of her back feels stiff now too. She was not sure if pain was radiating. What was crazy is that her arm pain was only for a short time prior and that was weeks before. She did not realize the pain was gravitating that it was moving. Hoping we can come up with a cure, did not want it to go on forever, it was scary. She was vey tiny. She had high cabinets and she was used to climbing 6-foot ladders to put things away and now cannot reach it. When she tried to climb a ladder now it was scary it hurt and she cannot go up high enough. The pain started moving and she called the doctor and he told her to take blood test to see what it showed. Provides results as C-reactive protein was up. CRP was up. ESR was elevated. Her husband who was a pharmacist told her those results show inflammation in the body. Adverse events following prior vaccinations: No, she did not take vaccines, never took shingles, flu, or pneumonia vaccine. She only got what she needed as a child and the last shot she had was about 10 years ago, it was a tetanus shot. Seriousness was reported as no. Outcome of the event ESR was elevated as well as her CRP was unknown, whereas other events was not recovered.  Information regarding the lot/batch number has been requested.
