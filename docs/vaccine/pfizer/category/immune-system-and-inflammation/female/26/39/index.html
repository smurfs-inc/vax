I took Tylenol and Benadryl and it relieved the fever/headache/body aches/joint pain, however the lymph nodes in my left axillary remained swollen. I continue to take Tylenol for the fever/body aches/pains without relief for the swollen and painful axillary lymph nodes. Warm  compresses do help to relieve the pain temporarily but they remain painfully swollen. On 01/08/21 I called my doctors office to ask if it was normal to experience such painfully swollen axillary lymph nodes to which they stated ?we don?t know, it is too soon for us to tell what?s normal and what isn?t normal right now.? They did not offer any suggestions to relieve the pain or swelling. The morning of 01/09/2021 , I called Employee Health at my hospital (my place of work and also where I received the vaccine) and they also stated they didn?t know if this was a normal reaction due to the newness of the vaccine. A couple hours later, employee health emailed me a link to the VAERS reporting website and asked me to file a report.

                                                Patient developed angioedema of her eyelids after COVID-19 vaccination.  She received her Covid vaccine on 1/10/2021 at 11:30 AM.  She received the Pfizer vaccine.  She works at a nursing home.  She had some fatigue and tiredness during the day but woke up on the second day without any symptoms.  On 1/30/2021, she developed bilateral eyelid swelling.  The swelling is mild to moderate intensity involving the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally with a prickly burning sensation associated with pruritus.  The reaction lasted less than a day and resolved without any skin desquamation, scarring or bruising.  She denies any hives anywhere else.  She does not have a large local reaction at the injection site.  She denies respiratory complaints, GI symptoms, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, wheezing, swelling of her throat or other symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis.  She used Benadryl with significant improvement.   She had a significant reaction after influenza vaccination consisting of swelling of her face and her eyelids with development of dry patches bilaterally within 2 days, resolving with skin desquamation.  The reaction lasted for 1 week.  She received her influenza vaccination in October 20, 2020.   She was seen in our office in 2012 for bilateral eyelid angioedema with associated urticaria shortly after swimming in the pool.  She was given oral antihistamines ?Zyrtec once daily? with significant improvement as well as prevention of this reaction.  She has not had this reaction  for more than 6 years.

A 26-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number= ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: cephalosporins, coconut. Other medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at time of 05:00 AM, the patient experienced blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine and continuing into day 4 DOST vaccine, swollen lymph nodes under bilateral arms that had not decreased, chills and sweating, headache. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post vaccination which included COVID nasal swab test and COVID PCR test, both were negative on 14Jan2021. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 2 minutes after injection, I had a sudden rush of warmth throughout my body starting in my abdomen then causing my pulse to feel like it was pounding out of my neck. Got light headed. EMS came and my blood pressure raised to 155/95 and my pulse was up in the 150s and I was shaking.  Started to go down but felt crappy for over 2 hours. Happened again 30seconds after the second injection. Pulse up to almost 160. 02 stats stayed normal. Post first injection had sore arm and lots of fatigue and brain fog. Following the second injection 12 hours post started having nausea, and diarrhea. Continued to have joint pain, muscle aches, headaches for days, and my lymph nodes swelled up and were extremely painful.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after injection (about 7pm) I had some common symptoms. I began to develop a mild fever of 100.3, body aches, headache, swollen arm. These persisted throughout the night. I treated with Tylenol as recommended. I got a LOT of sleep and  fever and headache persisted until about noon the next day. By 4pm I was feeling good again except my lymph nodes under my left arm are swollen and are tender and painful.  I am treating the swollen lymph node pain with Tylenol. Over all the fever only lasted less than 24 hours with plenty of sleep.   It also is worth noting that my first dose I had zero side effects. These side effects from the second dose seem harmless enough and tolerable as they don&#39;t last long.

A 26-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 19Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON) for contraceptive implant. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 29Dec2020. The patient reported a side effect from receiving the vaccine, lymph nodes on her arms got swollen to &#34;softball size&#34; since 19Jan2021 when she received the second dose of the vaccine and wants to know if this was normal. She understands that the arm was going to hurt, but she was noticing that her forearm hurts super bad and it a bit swollen, just on the side of the forearm its swollen, but under that arm her lymph nodes are swollen, she can barely pick up the arm and it just hurts on 20Jan2021. She noticed yesterday (19Jan2021), the lymph nodes were really tender, she would push it and it would hurt. Then when she got home from work, she lifted the arm to look at it, and she could see the swollen lymph nodes, the longer she kept the arm up, she could see the lymph nodes getting bigger. She wants to know how long this will last. She was talking to her mom and she was freaking out saying that people are dying from covid and the swollen lymph nodes, and that&#39;s why she has called today. She also stated that her left side swollen lymph nodes was worsened on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event swollen lymph nodes was not recovered, left forearm hurting and swelling and forearm hurts super bad was recovering while other events were unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my COVID19 vaccines on 12/31/2020 and 1/21/2021. On 2/3/2021 I woke up with pain, swelling, redness, and decreased range of motion in my R elbow at the site where I had hardware (wires, pins, tension band) placed during a surgical repair of my olecranon process in 2013. I have never had any issues with this elbow since the surgery, and no illnesses/dental work/medication changes in the months before this. The only change was getting my COVID vaccine. I went to see my PCP Dr. who advised me to go to the ER due to fear of a potential infection based on these symptoms. I went to the ER and after extensive testing they ruled out this being an infectious cause, though I was put on PO doxycycline as a precaution. An orthopedic specialist came to see me and determined that my body is essentially rejecting the hardware and I need to have surgery to have it removed. Since then, the swelling has decreased, however I still have persistent pain in my elbow along the site where the hardware is inserted and limited mobility due to pain with certain movements that put tension on this joint. I will need to have surgery eventually to have the hardware removed but am hoping to wait a couple months so that I can complete nursing school. I was advised to report any potential side effects from this vaccine and am choosing to do so as I do not know of any other reason this could be happening.

Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications.

The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

Patient was monitored by staff from thereafter.  At 11:52am a second dose of 25mg diphenhydramine was given to patient due to possibly lip swelling reported by nurse. Patient denied shortness of breath or chest pain.  By 12:12pm marked lip and face swelling reported by nurse monitoring patient. Again patient denied shortness of breath/wheeze/chest pain. However, we advised patient that lip/face swelling is considered anaphylaxis and because symptoms were  progressing and not mitigated by diphenhydramine epinephrine would be advised. Epinephrine 0.3mg via auto injector pen was administered to patient on left outer thigh and 911 was called.  EMS arrived at 12:22pm and took patient to  local emergency department.

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

The chest pain made it unbearable to move and lasted about 2 minutes. As my husband and I were ready to go to the hospital, the pain subsided. It did not come back for the remainder of the night or the next two days, but I still have minor chest soreness lingering.

                                                Three days after both doses of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine, I experienced hand pain throughout the night that traveled up my forearms. On a scale from 1-10 the pain was about a 7.  After the first dose, the pain went away in the morning and I was fine. On the third day after the second dose, I woke up with a rash all over my body and again had pain throughout the night only this time I woke up with swollen hands. It?s now been two weeks since my second dose and I am still experiencing hand pain, though improving. My hands feel sore and tight.

I also noticed at about 30 hours when I was showering that I had swollen lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my left armpit when I raised my arm above my head. Now, 45 hours later I feel more like myself but the sore arm and swollen lymph nodes still persist.

A 27-year-old female patient, not pregnant, received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm, on 04Feb2021 16:15, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included having had fillers before. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) on an unknown date at 27-years-old for covid-19 immunization. The vaccine was received at the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She stated having had fillers before and now where she&#39;s had the fillers, she was swollen and it&#39;s very painful. This was also besides the fever, body aches, and chills she has. As for the lot number of the vaccine, she was too sick to get out of bed to look for it. All the adverse events happened on 05Feb2021. The outcome of all the adverse events was unknown. The patient has not been COVID-19-tested post-vaccination.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

                                                At 11:00 pm I had an extremely intense seizure that caused me to convulse on the floor while arching my back. My partner thought I was dying as it was much more intense and extreme then normal. I am still having increased seizures in both pain and severity daily. Typically my seizures last 20 minutes and are from 4-5 in discomfort in pain out of ten. Now they are around 7, even a week later. The first severe seizure was a 10 level pain and diabling.   I also got severe swelling in my arm of the site, extreme pain in the my arm lasting four days, and two large cold sores. Typically my cold sores small and last for two days. Mine are still active and gave me a fat lip. I also have extreme fatigue but could be caused by the increased seizures and pain of them.   I been unable to perform my normal duties and responsibilities, which my seizures typically do not interfere with.

                                                Cold sores lip; Swollen Left Arm; Seizures; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 27-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) at age of 27 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (To not die from Covid). Medical history included functional neurological disorder from Nov2019 and ongoing. There was not any history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were not any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no adverse events following prior vaccinations (she did not have any vaccines since she got the seizure disorder). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The vaccination was given: 12:15, kept 30 minutes because of disorder (24 hour clock). The patient experienced seizures from 19Mar2021 to 24Mar2021, swollen left arm from 20Mar2021 to 23Mar2021, Cold sores lip from 21Mar2021 and ongoing. Cold sores lip was reported as worsened. The patient stated that she had a seizure disorder and a lot of people online were saying that they had questions about seizures and the vaccine on the epilepsy site, but there wasn&#39;t much information. She had seizures for four days after her first dose. She did not have epilepsy, she had functional neurological disorder.  She normally had seizures that cause her to freeze or fall or have a kick. She stated that this time though, she had the ones that most people get, falling on the floor and convulsing.  She would be getting the second one but she wanted to let us know. She stated she got that Covid weight. She had seven seizures over four days. She was back to her normal with her disorder and she was not losing consciousness. She also reported a swollen left arm. She reported getting 2 cold sores. She got them when her immune system struggling. She had two on lip and that had never happened. She stated they were really inflamed and it looked like someone punched her in the lip. She usually had them for a week. She got them once a year if she was really sick, had a fever or the flu. The patient Took 2 Ativan as treatment. She stated that it kind of helped but not really. She took it on 20Mar2021. She also took alcohol because it usually lowered the seizure threshold and she won&#39;t get any but it wasn&#39;t helping. The patient was having an increase and change in type of seizures after receiving the first Covid vaccine. She had an increase in her normal seizures. They were normally 3-4 minutes and she medicates them away. Those started around 16:00. She stated they then got too powerful and too many for too long around 18:00. At 20:00 she had seizures where she would lose consciousness and fall to the ground. She had 6-7 of those. She stated that each day they were getting weaker and weaker. She stated the one at 20:00 was 10/10 painful and scary and people thought she was dying but she was not. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She stateds that they were in a different state, they went to an island and decided if she had second one that night then would go but she didn&#39;t. She stated that she was not supposed to go [to the emergency room] unless they last 5 minutes or longer and hers lasted 3 minutes.  The outcome of event seizures was recovered on 24Mar2021. The outcome of event swollen left arm was recovered on 23Mar2021. The outcome of event Cold sores lip was not recovered.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

                                                Woke with up chest, arm and jaw pain on 03/21/2021. Presented to the ED. Her initial EKG was negative for any acute changes but her troponin was elevated. Cardiology was consulted. Her echo was negative for cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. But after her troponin continued to rise she was taken to the cath lab to look for ischemia. Her cardiac angiography was negative for obstructive disease, and coronary arteries were completely normal. Had low magnesium and potassium- so started on oral supplementation. Discharged on 03/22/2021 with nitroglycerin (which was not helpful and made her feel worse/nauseated) and to follow up with outpatient cardiac MRI and cardiology. This imaging revealed significant myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis.   04/01/2021 Per Cardiology: -Given that the patient had covid 19 back in November 2019 I believe she may have had a low yield subacute myocardial infection at that time that was somehow exacerbated by her 1st covid vaccine. Therefore, after some consideration and careful discussion I am advising against the 2nd vaccine at this time.  -No physical exercise for 6 months given her current myocarditis and family hx of sudden cardiac death -May trial PRN NSAIDS for pain relief -Recommend birth control and no pregnancy until at least after her follow up cMRI  -Follow up in 6 months with cMRI prior

                                                This is a 27 y.o. female with a PMH of hypothyroidism, obesity, and chronic migraines who presented to Lakeside ED on 4/13/21 for evaluation of chest pain. In the ED, her troponin was elevated at 1.73. EKG showed NSR with nonspecific t-wave abnormality. CTA chest and CXR were negative for acute findings. She was given 325 mg aspirin and cardiology was consulted. HMS was asked to admit for ongoing evaluation and management.    Her troponin was trended and peaked at 9.59, trended down to 8.18 on the day of discharge.  Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF at 62% and no wall motion abnormalities. Her CRP was elevated at 25.5. Cardiac MRI 4/14 showed evidence of epicardial delayed enhancement consistent with myocarditis, no evidence of myocardial infarction. She was diagnosed with myocarditis, possibly related to recent Pfizer COVID vaccination (vs other viral etiologies). ID was consulted and added on labs to rule out a mild case of MIS-A as well.  Labs pending at time of d/c (ferritin, d dimer, CRP/ESR, COVID total AB, and IL-6).  Depending on results, PCP may consider outpatient referral to rheumatology.    Discussed with her to only have mild to moderate physical activity for the next 12 weeks, avoid or limit alcohol, and limit caffeine intake. F/u with cardiology in 2-3 weeks, and PCP in 1 week.

I had extreme swelling and hardening in the areas where I have HA fillers - lips and tear troughs. Both Restylane products. Ended up going to the ER at 2 AM and receiving angioedema/anaphylaxis protocol. IV benedryl, famotidine, and solumedrol. Was put on prednisone and hydroxyzine for at home care for the next 3 days after event. Swelling went down by the next afternoon.

I also developed blisters ( almost like herpes like) on the R side of my nose and on the inside of my nose. I never had blisters in my life, or herpes like blisters on my face. Now on 1/5/21, the blisters are starting to dry, but are still there. I as ask to contact you guys to see if I can get my second dose.

The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

                                                Day after vaccine : mild shortness of breath, sensation of swelling in my throat/neck area. Took Benadryl 50mg before bedtime.  2 days after vaccine: woke up with voice changes, coughing/choking with speaking. Used epipen once, felt full relief for about 1-2 hours. Trouble speaking again. Then went to ER, had epipen again twice, over two hours, Benadryl 50IV and Pepcid and steroids. Sitting in the ER now debating admission. Likely being admitted., home epipen are too expensive to treat q2h by myself.

                                                I got the COVID Pfizer vaccine and experienced warmth in my chest with the first vaccine. It went away after one day and was tolerable. I also developed a lump under my right armpit with the first dose that slowly went away. It was painful, but the pain was tolerable. With the second vaccine, I also got the chest warmth and chest pressure for 2 days. I did not seek help as it was also tolerable. I also developed the lump under my armpit with the 2nd dose, this time I still have it and it is more painful and bigger. I have been taking naproxen for the pain.

Established care with me 1/14/2021 and noted to have 3/6 systolic murmur.  Patient (who is a PA) states it is significantly louder than it was prior to vaccination.

I took Benadryl and hour after the incident. The EMS monitored me while It was happening and since I was still breathing ok  I decided to leave and get Benadryl since they didn&#39;t have any.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number requested) in the hospital via intramuscular route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose on the right deltoid for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  The patient medical history was not reported and there were no concomitant medications. The patient was previously administered a flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced sore arm. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was reported that the patient developed supraclavicular lymphnode swelling on 11Jan2021 and was calling to see if this is normal or if it was something others have experienced. She noticed that last week or about 5 days (also reported as 11Jan2021) after receiving the vaccine her supraclavicular lymph node was swollen.  She stated that it was just that one lymph node on the same side that she received the injection. She added that the lymph node is not as painful, but is still tender and is mobile. She said that it is tender if she pushes on it. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Lymph nodes became enlarged again to 8-10 mm in diameter the day following 2nd vaccine dose and again gradually decreased in size and still around pea sized currently. Made future appointment with my PCP after initial symptoms, was scheduled 1.5 weeks out for 1/22/2021. Contacted my work and PCP prior to appointment on 1/20/2021 to discuss improving symptoms, was reassured that as size of lymph nodes were decreasing, no further lab/diagnostic testing needed at that time so 1/22/2021 visit was canceled since I was about to receive the 2nd dose on 1/23/2021 so symptom monitoring was recommended. Was seen by my PCP for annual physical 2/10/2021 where lymph nodes were palpable, small in size. Continued monitoring was recommended at that time.

Had overwhelming fatigue. 12/27 worsening tongue sores and thrush, had another appointment where given nystatin. At this appointment was diagnosed with an immune over response to the COVID-19 vaccine. The thrush still was not improving and extremely painful. Was started on Fluconazole for 14 days after another appointment on 12/29. No history of thrush, have good oral hygiene and follow all recommendations to prevent thrush with my inhaler.

                                                Next morning, I woke up with severe positional headache (headache with standing or sitting up, resolved completely with ibuprofen and tylenol within 20 minutes). The next morning I also had a sore left deltoid, and soreness extending into my left chest and shoulder, which diminished throughout the day after ibuprofen and tylenol. I also had a left swollen armpit, which I interpreted as swollen lymph nodes. My left armpit was sore and was visibly swollen compared to the right. The left lymph node is still visibly swollen as I report this (approximatley 36 hours after vaccine administration), and is sore but less sore than initially.   Of note, when I received the first vaccine in this series, my left deltoid was more sore than with the second administration, but soreness was limited to the deltoid and resolved within 3 days.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EL1284/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration in the right arm, on 30-DEC-2020 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 29 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Relevant medical history was none. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On an unknown date, the patient experienced right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy - five freely mobile lymph nodes, tender to palpation, roughly 1 cm in size. The patient did not receive treatment for the event right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The outcome of the event right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was not recovered. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

On Friday, 1/8, I also experienced headache for the entire day, and I was fatigued for much of the day.   I noted clavicular lymph nodes as well.  About 18-20 hours after vaccination, I developed soreness in my back, and about 24 hours after vaccination, I noted some myalgia in the left leg.  These symptoms were responsive to acetaminophen.  The headache, clavicular lymph nodes, arm soreness, and myalgias were resolved by the time I woke up on 1/9.  Finally, I noted development of an axillary lymph node during the evening of 1/8, about 28 hours after vaccination.  This axillary node persisted until Monday, 1/11.

Pain limited daily activity to the right arm. Pain decreased for about 12 hours and then the pain returned again around 06:00, Thursday 1/14/2021 with lymph node larger than previous day. Area is tender and painful with every day movements. Will consult with primary health care provider if pain/swelling does not improve or gets worse.

A 29-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold sores. Concomitant medication included valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) from 2009 and ongoing for cold sores, ongoing fluticasone propionate (FLONASE ALLERGY RELIEF), ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (BLISOVI FE 1/20) from 2006 and ongoing for birth control. The patient previously received first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899) on 15Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fever and body aches. The reporter wanted to verify if it was an interaction. She didn&#39;t feel like it was a drug interaction. She was questioning if there could be a drug interaction. She took Valtrex for cold sores on her face. She received her second dose of the COVID vaccine yesterday on 06Jan2021. Today 07Jan2021, she got a cold sore this morning and took Valtrex. She was wondering if the Valtrex, being an antiviral, could affect the vaccine in any way. She got the cold sores randomly anyway. They come on because of stress. She has a history with them. Caller didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine through work. This time for second dose she developed body aches only. She received the vaccine yesterday 06Jan2021, and developed body aches today 07Jan2021. They have worsened as the day went on, but she was at work. Since she was home now and not moving around as much they weren&#39;t as bad. She got the vaccine because she worked in a nursing home. She was an essential worker who was at high risk. The outcome of events was unknown.

Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.

I didn&#39;t call my doctor at that point because I read that it was a side effect. Dull/always there pain at that point. On the 15th, shooting pains - this lasted two days. It started getting better again by the 17th. It was resolved by the 18th.  14-17th - Swelling that I could feel and see and that also went back to normal by the 18th. It was just tender to touch for a little while after that....after it didn&#39;t hurt to move I didn&#39;t pay as much attention to it.

From my neck, to my armpit, to my low back and in my groin, i have swelling in spots up and down my left side. I had a fever starting 24hr after the injection. This lasted until today and was treated with OTC IBUPROFEN. The ibuprofen has had no effect on the swelling or pain in nodes. Aches, chills, and joint pain are other secondary complaints/effects with more milder level of pain.  It?s been 3 days since injection and the swelling in my lymph nodes does not seem to be getting better.

Swelling has caused the tattoos to swell up. Smaller rash bumps can be seen on top of tattoos that look different from the large welts. Primarily only on tattoos.  OTC Topical cortisone cream has not relieved itching or welts. Prescription Topical Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1% has not made any changes.

                                                About 36 hours after shot, my lymph nodes in my left arm pit became swollen and painful. This progressed to the lymph nodes around my chest and neck, and I developed a lump of swollen lymph nodes on the back of my neck about 48 hours after my shot that lasted about a day. My lymph nodes in my chest arm and underarm stayed swollen for about a week.   About 48 hours after my shot, I began experience minor muscle spasms in my right foot, then in the arm muscle where I was injected. Throughout that day and the next week, I experienced minor muscle spasms throughout my entire body. They were  most prominent on my left side of my body where I got the injection. I also felt weakness and tingling in my left arm for about a week. The muscle spasms throughout my body and weakness in my left arm continued slowly subsided over about 3 weeks after my shot. They were minor spasms, but were persistent across the three weeks.

On 3/6/21 I started experiencing  slight pain in my axillary region. Pain was probably 3 of 10. Stayed at this pain level until 3/8, when it started to increase and to date pain is increasing and there is a large lump in my under my arm. Lifting my arm above my shoulder increases pain. Pain also wraps around to my shoulder area. I have never had any pain in or around this region until after the vaccine.

The left side of my face was not affected and there was no respiratory involvement. In the following few hours, my right eye had transient pain and my cheek felt swollen. The next day, I had chills, arm soreness, mild headache at times, and while my facial symptoms were still present, they had improved. The second day I only had mild numbness and tingling on my face with some lip tingling. Day three, four, and five I had slight numbness of the right side of my face and tingling lips, no further symptoms. As of day 6, I have slight eye pressure around my right eye and mild lip tingling.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

It all started when I was working at ER when I started to feel cold like it was in an ice bath and numbness in both feet. I went to discharge my patients when I realized ascending numbness and coldness from the feet was traveling upward. Within 5 hours (around midnight) I went to hospital due to having severe weakness to where I couldn?t walk and loss of bladder control. I was rushed to MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I also had blood work done and a lumbar puncture. I was admitted for a couple days to watching the ascending weakness and loss of feeling. My MRIs came back clear from any diseases such as transverse myelitis, MS, etc. My LP showed mild elevated protein at 54 (normal range 15-45), one tube elevated lymphocytes 100% (range 40-80%) and one tube elevated monocytes 50% (range 15-45%). Also CK-MB w/reflex was 352 (range 26-140). I was discharged on 2/26 at 5:30pm with a diagnosis of bilateral leg weakness and numbness. From this point on I was wheelchair bound at home and being cared for 24/7. After discharge some additional random symptoms started such as chills with no fever to where I slept in sweat pants and sweat shirts, leg spasms/ twitches, leg heaviness, severe lower back and hip pain, a loss of sensation while going pee or poo but not incontinent, and things like drop foot with the severe weakness and numbness . On 2/3/22 I started with double vision, blurry vision and pain behind my right eye. I went to ER and had repeat MRIs of brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar with and without contrast and basic blood work and was sent home to follow up with Dr. on 2/9 and was discharged home. By 2/8 my strength started to get worse to where I couldn?t lift my kids. Finally saw Dr. neurology and MS specialist 2/9, he ran detailed neuro exams from head to toe, looked at both scans from both hospitals, all the blood work and LP results. He reported that I had severe hyper reflexes in both legs and Hoffman?s sign in both hands. My feet were completely numb and cold to where I couldn?t feel them or walk. Literally felt like everyday I was standing in a ice cold bath with no feeling of touch hot or cold sensation or pin pricks. He realized my loss of sensation was from my bra line down and included tingling in my hands and weakness in my arms. I was able to get up for the first time with a walker and take a few steps with assistance at this time. He then sent me to ER to be admitted and see their neuromuscular team to get further treatment. Upon arrival via wheelchair I was brought back to see the ER Doctor and re-did a neuro exam, some blood work and contacted the neurology team to come see me. I was then admitted to the hospital step down ICU under Dr with strict monitoring. On 2/10/21 The neuro team ordered another set of MRI of brain, cervical and thoracic with and without contrast due to a change in condition again since my last visit to hospital. They reviewed and compared studies with no changes. They scheduled me for MRI lumbar on 2/11/21 with and without contrast which came back no changes from previous MRI as well as another LP which everything that was off before was now normal. Everyday I would work with PT, OT and speech. I had no changes in speech and slowly got some strength back, and was able walk using a walker. I was then discharged home on 2/13 mid afternoon and was told I would do home health and follow up with their neurologist and Neuromusclar team once everything was resulted back. On 2/19/21 I saw my primary doctors office (nurse practitioner) where she checked up on the status of me, took me officially off work and on state disability, filled out paperwork for work and a handicapped pass. On 2/25/21 followed up with neurology, and discussed all my imaging and blood work. All CSF fluid came back normal, all labs were fine and wanted me to get an EMG to look for nerve damage. She also wanted a follow up with cardiology as my resting heart rate was 110-120 and would spike to 160s. On 3/1/21 Home health was started for physical therapy for strengthening and working on sensation for both legs. At this point I had almost full strength in my arms, still tingling in my hands and constant numbness and cold feeling in both feet and knees with severe sensitivity to cold, wind or touch on my legs. I had Home health twice a week every week for 2-3 weeks then started outpatient physical therapy which has been twice a week for 1.5 hours. On 3/5 I saw cardiology and was placed on a holt monitor for 48 hour monitoring. On 3/9 I had my EMG with Dr. and had a follow up with Dr. for 35 tubes of blood he had drawn for multiple diseases which both blood work and EMG came back negative. On 3/16 symptoms started to change from numbness to severe hypersensitivity to touch, severe shooting nerve pains, burning sensations, non stop tingling in hands, issues with temperatures either hot or cold, and swelling of both legs. On 3/17 I saw rheumatology that looked into everything said it was not lupus related as none of my inflammatory markers or lupus DNA strands were elevated and no lupus symptoms like rashes, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, hair loss or joint pain. He ordered more blood work and confirmed it was not a lupus flare up. He suggested doing a small nerve fiber biopsies. On 3/19/21 saw spinal orthopedics who reassured it has nothing to do with my spine, prescribed gabapentin for all the nerve pain and told me that neurology is who should be following me. On 3/26 I had an echocardiogram done due to the leg swelling and heart rates which came back negative for any heart problems and was told since the tachycardia is getting better to just continue watching it and was prescribed trazodone 25mg to help with sleep due to severe nerve pains, spasms and severe back and hip pains at night. On 4/1/21 was followed up again with neurology. Ordered small nerve fiber biopsy for may 18th, increased the gabapentin to 300 mg- 3 times a day and had me wean off cymbalta. I am still dealing with tingling, burning hot and cold sensitivities in both legs, still tingling in hands all day but strength is back to full. I am scheduled to hopefully return to work 5/30/2021 after being off since 1/24/2021.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 30Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The reporter is not related to a study or program. Concomitant medications included unspecified medication (She does take other medications but does not know the significance). On 30Mar2021, the physician stated that, the patient developed immediate right-side neck pressure, skin and jaw tingling, and swollen lymph nodes. She did not have any trouble breathing and did not have any hives. These events were considered as medically significant. The pharmacist gave her 2 Benadryl and she stayed there for an hour. She said she does not think the Benadryl did anything for her. The physician stated that the patient went home and slept off the immediate reaction she experienced and had fatigue for 3 days. The patient had fatigue for 3 days and no other problems. The physician inquired on advisable information for the second dose. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported serious events cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Clinical course: the patient was asking for advice because she had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine 1 week ago and had a really bad reaction and had to go to the hospital. It has been a week now and the symptoms are continuously getting worse. It sounds like the side effects were all expected. She felt like she had the flu yesterday. She is really achy, her lymph nodes in her underarm area are really swollen, and it hurts to move her arm. She is familiar that these symptoms are expected, but it has been a week. She wants to know if she should see a physician or if there is something she should do. Event details: The flu like feeling was not until 6 days after she got the first shot. It is not as bad but she does have aches and congestion. Her lymph nodes are really swollen and she has a headache and tiredness. She had symptoms before, that was just the start of the flu like feeling. On the day of the shot she went to the hospital because she completely lost her vision and had chest pain. She got the shot on Monday, 12Apr2021. She had numbness in her face, vision loss, and chest pain. From there she went to the hospital and that subsided. It was just like total exhaustion and body aches for the next couple of days. She lost her vision for 5 minutes total. The numbness to her face was right after the shot and is all gone now. The achiness is pretty bad now. It differs per day but her symptoms have probably gotten a little worse as time has gone on. She had slight pain in her lymph nodes and they weren&#39;t really swollen. It got progressively worse to now they are very swollen and it hurts to move her arm. It was the same arm where the shot was given. The headache is off and on. It started around Thursday 15Apr2021. It is sporadic when she gets it. It hasn&#39;t gone away. The tiredness has been the same since she got the shot. When she went to the hospital she went to the ER. She was not admitted. She spent 4 to 5 hours there. Treatment: In the ER she just had an IV (intravenous). Other than that they did a bunch of lab work. She had no medicine or anything. Investigations: They did a chest X-ray and lab work in the ER. Emergency Room Visit required for events completely lost her vision, chest pain, numbness in her face, felt like she had the flu.

Not much longer and the hives/itching spread down my back and chest. Face became swollen. Benadryl cream was initially attempted, but only briefly subsided the itching and reaction continued spreading. I took oral quick release Benadryl and was able to prevent the reaction from continuing. I had to take a secondary Benadryl dose a few hours later and extreme joint pain accompanied the allergic reaction.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

At that point, I started to get very dizzy and lightheaded. Every time I opened my eyes, everything was spinning. This lasted four about 3-4 hours. I kept breaking out into sweats. I had a horrible headache for about 4 days straight. I am still continuing to having headaches. I am still having hot flashes and dizziness episodes at times that go away after about a few minutes. Two days ago, I stated to developing swelling in my hands with achy joints which has not gone away.

                                                periorbital edema, lip swelling Narrative: ED note: This is a 29 year old employee who got her COVID vaccine yesterday. This morning she noticed facial puffiness, mostly around her eyes. No swelling of lips, toungue, no trouble swallowing or speaking, no swelling of throat, no SOB, no n/v or dizziness. Here she had some mild periorbital puffiness that I would not be aware of if she did not point it out to me. There is no swelling of her lips, airway and no SOB or problems with her voice. Her symptoms are improving in the ER. I think it is unlikely that this delayed symptom is related to the vaccine, however, she also states she had some swelling of the right side of her lip yesterday (none today), so I&#39;m going to prescribe her an epi-pen.

                                                Incredible arm/shoulder/lymph node pain starting 10 hours post-vaccination lasting about 60 hours. About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two &#34;attacks&#34;.  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of &#34;foggy&#34; 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these &#34;attacks&#34;, not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours. It is currently about 70 hours post-vaccination and most symptoms except moderate arm soreness are gone. During both attacks, BP and temperature were normal, heart rate slightly elevated (80-85 bpm).  Other non-severe effects included fatigue,  slight chills/flush.

I was so tired and sleepy I slept almost all day for the first 48 hrs after. Developed fever between 100.5-101 which lasted about 18hrs which did require me to have to call into work the following day.  2/3 I developed swelling and pain in the lymph nodes under my right arm and breast.  The swelling subsided within 4days but I still have some tenderness to date.  I took tylenol and ibuprophen for the first 48 hours to help with all the symptoms.

My face felt &#34;buzzy&#34; but didn&#39;t swell and I did not have significant itching. I have had similar reactions in the past to cleaning products and pesticides and usually take a benadryl, though I do carry an epipen and had one with me at the time. Instead of going back in the convention center for medical attention I took a benadryl and waited in the parking garage for about an hour and felt the throat restriction ease a bit. About 10 hours later around 8pm the tightness came back suddenly over about 10 minutes and I took another benadryl. The next morning around 7am I had one more round of tightening and took one more benadryl, and it stopped after that. I told my doctor about it a few days later.

                                                After having the second Pfizer COVID 19 shot on 2/13 I noticed about a 1 inch swollen left cervical (neck) lymph node. It wasn?t overly tender to the touch but it was mildly sensitive. I took a picture of it and contacted my OBGYN who thought since it was on the side my vaccine was given (left arm) and appeared one day after vaccination that it was likely due to the vaccine and to keep an eye on it, she was not concerned. I kept track of it for several days and the size started to decrease over the next 2-3 weeks approximately. It is now essentially gone. There may be very very small swelling noted if I side bend my head to the right to make the lymph node on the left side of my neck pop out but it is extremely mild. I?ve had no pain or issue in the area. At the time of the vaccine I was 21 weeks pregnant. My due date is approaching.

Within 12 hours, the itching got much worse and my three toes started to swell. The itch was bad enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep, but I wouldn&#39;t say there was much pain. I noticed a cut in between a couple of my toes and a small blister. I thought it was Athlete&#39;s foot until a colleague told me about COVID toes. I&#39;ve been taking Benadyrl and using athlete&#39;s foot products (Lotrimin) that have been helping with the itch. Going on day 5 with some reduction in swelling.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

My arm was extremely sore for more than a week. I could barely fully extend my entire arm and I developed a lump in the pit of my arm pit. Both my tricep and  bicep mussels were tender. I also experienced headaches and tinnitus. The soreness of my arm and lump have gone away however I still have headaches and tinnitus to this day.

Was in severe pain in neck with difficulty swallowing.  Went to urgent care and was given muscle relaxers. Pain continued for 3 weeks after, severe still. Began chiropractor visits, no improvement. Had MRI completed, showed golf ball sized lymph node swelling in neck on side of severe pain. Went to ENT for course of steroids with mild improvement. Still having mild to moderate neck pain everyday and it has been 2 months since vaccine. Would never get this type of vaccine again, and I am a medical professional who usually trusts them.

This was controlled 3 hours later by tylenol. For the next 36 hours post symptom onset my sinuses were still affected, my muscles felt very weak and the glands in my neck felt swollen. Everything has resolved except the swollen glands in my neck and my sinsuses being dry and painful.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

                                                After my first dose, the only symptom I had was soreness at the injection site lasting 1 day. 12 hours after my second vaccine, I developed muscle aches and chills that were gone the following morning when I woke up. 3 days after receiving my second dose, I developed hives and swelling on my entire body that progressed over 2 days. I also started to have some swelling in my throat by 4 days after the second dose and ended up going to immediate care for a steroid injection which began to provide relief by the next morning.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiration date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included testing positive for COVID in Apr2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced soreness. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient called in regards to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She received her first vaccine last Thursday, 07Jan2021. She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. She didn&#39;t expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn&#39;t have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it&#39;s not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn&#39;t have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy. She doesn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or anything. It&#39;s not a major reaction, just a little bit of a rash/itchiness in her chest and neck area. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 10Jan2021, for lymphadenopathy and rash was recovering, for pruritus was not recovered and for feeling hot was unknown.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

I had malaise a few hours after the shot. 12 hours after the shot, this turned into a fever that would peak at 103 within the next 12 hours. Fever was accompanied by severe chills, moderate headache, moderate muscle aches, mild joint aches, and mild nausea. I also had a swollen lymph node under my armpit ipsilateral to the injection, the diameter of a baseball. Discomfort from the lymph node was mild. The fever and chills were so bad that I couldn&#39;t do any daily activities and stayed in bed all day. I called a nurses line to ask them if I could take something for the discomfort and they advised Tylenol, so I took 1000 mg. Tylenol did bring down the fever to 101 and the fever rose back to 103, 9 hours after Tylenol. All the aforementioned symptoms lasted for 3 days, and the severe symptoms decreased in severity to &#34;moderate&#34; after about 36 hours.

                                                Within thirty minutes of administration I started feeling itchy around injection site then all over my entire body.  I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

                                                At around 5pm, I developed low grade fever. Lasted for an hour or so then went away. In the middle of the night, I developed a high grade fever (101.4), which was gone by the time I woke up. Later in the day a low grade fever returned and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck became enlarged. I called out of work for the next day, Monday, and completed the employee covid testing survey. Monday morning the lymph nodes in my neck were about the size of a golf ball and I was incredibly fatigued. Got tested for COVID (came back negative) and remained with an intermittent low grade fever, fatigue, headache, and sore throat for the remainder.

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

A 31-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Feb2021 at 13:15, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Patient did not have known allergies and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included piroxicam (PAXIL) and lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE). Patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient experienced light cough on 11Feb2021 at 14:45 with outcome of recovering, shortness of breath on 11Feb2021  with outcome of recovering, anaphylaxis on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, lost voice entirely on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. The events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. The patient was hospitalized due to the events in Feb2021 for 1 day. Events were considered life threatening. Clinical course: light cough after half an hour from vaccination. Within 2 to 3 hours had lost voice entirely and was suffering from shortness of breath. Her primary physician told her to go to the emergency room or he was calling an ambulance because he said it sounded like anaphylaxis and that her life was in danger. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with intravenous (IV) Decadron Pepcid and epinephrine. She received the 2nd dose on 21Feb2021 at 01:15 PM.

                                                About 10 days after receiving the 1st injection of the COVID-19 Pfizer-Biontech injection, I noticed a significant lump on my left collarbone that was palpable - had not been there in the weeks prior. It was somewhat tender to the touch and would move. My PCP examined the lump and ordered a neck ultrasound for the supraclavicular mass which found &#34;mildly prominent lymph nodes in the supraclavicular region without frank lymphadenopathy and one small lymph node that measures approximately 4mm in short axis diameter that is not clearly demonstrating a fatty hilum but is smoothly marginated with a hypoechoic cortex.&#34; PCP then ordered Lactate Dehydrogenase test on 02/12/2021 which was slightly elevated at 629 IU/L (WNL considered as 313- 618 IU/L). Additional labs ordered and collected on 02/13/2021 for LD Isoenzymes, Ferritin and Iron/Transferrin - all within normal limits.  I received my 2nd injection on 02/05/2021. Then the following week the lump was even larger and more prominent and somewhat painful. Reported to my PCP who referred me to a ENT Head/Neck specialist and examined it without concern. Had follow-up appointment 2 weeks later and specialist still not concerned due to the lymphnode becoming smaller in size.  I can still palpate the lymphnode (as of 03/06/2021) but it is much smaller. Plan to wait until 6 weeks after 2nd vaccine injection and then will pursue further follow-up if still palpable.

When I stood up and unfolded mi arm I felt a shooting pain along mi arm all the way to my fingers( don&#39;t remember exactly which fingers) and I started to feel my arm get hot from the site of injection towards my fingers. It lasted for about 1 to 2 minutes. And I had a residual shooting pain for about 5 minutes, coming and going. Then at 9 pm I had my fingers completely swollen, I couldn&#39;t take my rings off. I still have my hand swollen. My arm has the normal pain that the injections is supposed to give, I can&#39;t raise my arm quite well without having pain on it.

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

It took hours just to get out of bed this morning, I felt so unwell.  I took 1000 mg of tylenol before bed on the day I received the vaccine (1/19), but I still woke up with fever. I continued to take 1000 mg throughout the day every 6 hours, which did help. Most symptoms resolved by 1/21 but I continue with fatigue and painful left axillary lymphadenopathy. The node is still really swollen and tender.

A 32-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), hypothyroidism and anxiety. Past drug history included allergy to cefprozil (CEFZIL). Relevant concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). On 12Jan2021, the patient had tachycardia, facial flushing, fatigue, arm pain and swelling. The events required a physician office visit. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 14Jan2021, the patient underwent a COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) which resulted positive. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 12Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 14Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

It did lower temporarily but went right back up and lasted 24 hours. I also had nausea, swollen glands, headache, and body aches.      24 hours after the start of symptoms, my fever has subsided. I still have a slight head ache and general malaise, but I am able to work today.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL3302; Expiration date was not reported) on 04Feb2021 (10:00) at a single dose on the left arm, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy/drug store (not a military facility). The patient did not have relevant medical history. Concomitant medication included ongoing amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient previously took a flu shot a couple of months ago, and had no reaction. On 04Feb2021 (10:00), the pharmacy reportedly screwed up, and gave the patient an entire vial of BNT162B2 instead of one dose. The patient was not feeling any side effects then. In Feb2021, the patient had a giant red circle/rash; and she was really swollen, inflamed and in pain (reported as &#34;painful&#34;). The patient did not receive any treatment for the giant red circle/rash and pain. The outcome of the events was recovering for &#39;giant red circle/rash&#39;, &#39;really swollen&#39;, &#39;inflamed&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;gave the patient an entire vial of BNT162B2 instead of one dose&#39;. The reporter had asked about whether she should receive the second dose.  Follow-up (08Feb2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient) included: reporter information, suspect vaccine details and new events (&#39;giant red circle/rash&#39;, &#39;really swollen&#39;, &#39;inflamed&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;).

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday, February 26th, 2021, around 10:20am.  I was fine throughout the day. I was also fine all day on Saturday, February 27th, 2021. Sunday, February 28th, 2021 at 1:30am, I woke up from sleep with double vision, dizziness, and lightheadedness. I went to use my bathroom, and began to feel week. I was still very lightheaded, and weak. I felt as though I was going to faint. My ears started to feel really warm, and I then vomited. I started feeling lightheaded and weak once again, and then suddenly had diarrhea. I was so dizzy, but managed to head to my bed to sleep. Every single day since, I have been dizzy and losing my balance. I wake up, walk around, and sleep dizzy. Then on Friday, March 5th, 2021 I developed a large lump directly under my armpit. I could not take the dizziness any longer and I went to the ER on Monday, March 8th. I was then diagnosed with vertigo and told that I most likely had lymphodenopathy.  Till this day, I am still having dizziness and will be seeing an ENT doctor. I also still have the lump under my armpit. My next dose is, March 19th, 2021.

                                                I had excruciating pain during the injection, which progressively worsened afterward reaching 10/10 L shoulder pain within several hours of the injection. The L shoulder pain was so bad that I could not sleep that night, and the L shoulder pain was unrelieved with OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen. I also noticed a new swollen lymph node under my left armpit the next morning. The L shoulder pain slightly decreased within 48 hours, but I have continued to have limited ROM of my left shoulder, a steady achey pain of my L shoulder, popping and crunching of my L shoulder with movement of my L shoulder, and difficulty abducting or flexing my L arm past 90 degrees since the injection. 2 weeks post-injection I saw an orthopedist who said my symptoms were caused from the vaccine injection and known as SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). He said I was injected too high, leading to injection of the vaccine material into my subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, causing persistent inflammation of the soft tissue leading to bursitis. He had to perform an US guided Toradol injection to attempt to calm down the inflammation caused from the injection.  I have a 4-week follow up with the orthopedist in April. He indicated that an MRI may be required to further evaluate my shoulder.

Upon waking the following morning, I had body aches, headaches, and chills.  The 2nd day after receiving the vaccine, one of my lymph nodes, along my left collar bone (left arm injection) became swollen. Now is the third day and I have woken up with a headache. Still don?t feel completely back to normal.  No treatment taken to date. Going to see my PCP on 3/23.

                                                I developed skin irritation and rash on my chest, neck,  torso, arms, back, legs, pelvic region Thursday evening, three days after receiving vaccine. This include severe itching, redness, inflammation, and visible red bumps. The symptoms are not getting better, so I visited  the Dr.. I was tested for COVID to make sure I was not exposed after the vaccine, and the results were negative for COVID. She prescribed me prescription strength cream, because the Cortisone cream, in combination with Zyrtec and Benadryl  are not working. She did not want to give me anything stronger due to concerns of hindering the effect of the vaccine. It appears to be a mild allergic reaction, but is extremely unpleasant. I cannot stop scratching no matter how hard a try and it is all over my body.

Went away after a few hours, and elevating my foot was enough to keep the swelling down in the meantime. I take amlodipine and used to have a problem with ankle swelling when I was on a much higher dose of it, so I was thinking the drugs may be interacting. I did not accidentally take a second dose of amlodipine or anything yesterday, just my usual 5mg that has never caused ankle swelling before.

The day after the dose of the vaccine I had a headache and body aches with severe back pain in my lower and mid back. My arm became swollen to the size of a baseball around the site of injection. It was a lump on the side of my arm and my arm was numb every once in a while. My arm was very painful and swollen and itchy. I had the issues with my arm for 10 to 14 days after each dose of the vaccine. I have been having severe backache and like something is sitting on my chest.

                                                The day after the dose of the vaccine I had a headache and body aches with severe back pain in my lower and mid back. My arm became swollen to the size of a baseball around the site of injection. It was a lump on the side of my arm and my arm was numb like maybe a nerve was damaged. My arm was very painful and swollen and itchy. I had the issues with my arm for 10 to 14 days after each dose of the vaccine. I have been having severe backache and like something is sitting on my chest. I still very fatigued after 10 weeks and I have severe back ache. I have been using Lidocaine for the pain and Naproxen and a muscle relaxer at times.

                                                The day after the second dose I felt sweaty hot and nauseous. I was still really sleepy on the third day. My eye started hurting and I could hear a buzzing sound in both ears. It got worse and worse by day six and I was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. It was really painful underneath my eye on the inside corner with swelling on the top lid. The Steroids seemed to help the problem with my eye. The doctor suspected Bells Palsy. On week two I was prescribed steroids from Lymphadenopathy. I still have the ringing in my ears which is increasing after it had subsided for a little time. I also felt pressure in my ears which is very uncomfortable. Whenever I stop taking the Steroids the ringing in my ears returns like Tinnitus. I plan to reach out to a doctor again because the ringing in my ears has returned after it had improved but was still present after 10 weeks. I did not have any of the same symptoms after the same dose. I have seen a lot of professionals.

This 32-year-old female patient (No pregnant) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: ER8737) on 05Apr2021 06:15 PM at single dose on Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was Immunocompromised, chronic migraines. Known allergies: Just seasonal allergies. Wheat and soy allergy, restricted diet. Concomitant medications (in two weeks) included fluticasone propionate (FLONASE) for allergies (nasal spray), mirtazapine (REMERON). No other vaccine in four weeks. Patient stated that I had the normal side effects of numbness and soreness in my left arm from 05Apr2021. Three days later I had allergy symptoms manifest, Thursday (the shot was on a Monday), and had to go get allergy medication. My throat felt restricted, I was having difficulty breathing, and my body felt like it was swelling up everywhere. I had hives and raised bumps and bruising on my left arm where the shot went in from 09Apr2021 ( reported as 08Apr2021 12:00 PM). Swelling noticeably went down after the allergy medication and breathing returned to normal. On Tuesday, 13Apr2021, after about three days of flu-like symptoms (nauseau, tiredness, body aches), I was admitted to the ER with a complex migraine and parathesia in my right arm, though the shot was in my left arm, and the migraine was in my left side of my head. I feel that this was an allergic reaction that happened belatedly and is a much stronger reaction than anyone else I have seen take the same dose and the same vaccine. AE resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was Allergy medication from 08Apr2021 to 13Apr2021 two IV&#39;s &#43; Benadryl. Outcome of the event was Recovering. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

I went to my PCP the next day, and they took pictures.   It&#39;s been two weeks and I am still managing intermittent pain in my left shoulder and arm. It has become more painful in the last 3 days. 5/5.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

                                                At the same day I felt my neck hurting all the way to my elbow. As the days progressed the pain got worse and I started feeling a bump on my neck. My whole left side from my neck to my elbow I would feel tremendous pain.  Days passed and nothing would get better so I spoke with my supervisor and she recommended me to go to the ER where they did some labs (blood work).  About 2 weeks later the pain in my left side subsided but the swelling on my neck and the &#34;bump&#34; never went away, although not painful. I received the second dose on 01/04/2021 and the same pain returned from my neck down to my elbow and the neck is swollen again and in pain. I decided not to go to the ER for the second dose and did not obtain medical help so far.

A 33-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included patient had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received COVID Vaccine on 18Dec2020 and ended up on Christmas she went to take a bath that was on 24Dec2020 or 25Dec2020 and noticed that her legs were all swollen and she was not used to that at all having swollen legs. She did work on her feet but she wasn&#39;t working on her feet for that week, so she just didn&#39;t know what was causing the swelling and within the last couple of days in Dec2020 she had a quick heart rate like her pulse, it&#39;s not that high but for she it was high it was like 112, 115 as her resting heart rate, so it&#39;s just been having like heart palpitations kind of, she just wanted to report that and kind of see if other people were getting that as a symptom possibly from vaccine. She had in her past had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. She had swollen legs like edema, so she was just hoping. And then the patient stated that she wasn&#39;t tired at the starting, so she wasn&#39;t tired the same day&#39; (could not be clarified further). No treatment was received for all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

The dr. Gave me 50 mg benedryl, and a shot of epinephrine.  After wards 911 was called, my heart rate was eventually brought down with the epinephrine as my symptoms began to be controlled. An inhaler was administered because I was short of breath. 3 hours later I was stabilized. I then was recommended to go to urgent care rather the emergency room since the wait was 13 hours to be monitored at the local hospital MLK. I went to urgent care near my home at Hoag hospital and they monitored me and gave me a steroid injection IM. I was discharged with an epi pen just in case abs to take benedryl every 6 hours .

It was very mild and resolved within 1 day.  On 1/4/21, she noticed L axillary lymphadenopathy returned. On 1/5/21, it had spread to her right axillary lymph node.

She still has swelling and tenderness at both axillary lymph nodes today 1/11/21. Severity is moderate in that it is painful, but not debilitating.

Which is still a little swollen but improving; pain at injection site/painfulness at the injection site; shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included immunosuppression. Concomitant medication included ongoing vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for immunosuppresion. The patient got a couple of the side effects listed. She developed painfulness at the injection site, and it was red a couple of days. She is wondering if she needs to be worried about getting the second one. It was pretty painful that night. It was pretty painful for the next day. If someone barely brushed up against it, it was very painful. Two days later, her husband noticed her shoulder was very red. And then she realized there was a defined red mark where the injections was. The pain is fine now. She didn&#39;t get a rash or have trouble breathing. She did have a swollen lymph node a couple of days later. Which is still a little swollen but improving. She does take an immunosuppressant. The outcome of the events pain at injection site and shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was recovered, while recovering for the event swollen lymph node a couple of days later was recovering.

                                                It started about 20 minutes after vaccination. I started to feel a rush of heat like a hot flash and my heart was racing while I was driving home. My cheeks and lips were swelled up. My tongue was starting to swell but I could still breathe. I was wheezing so I took a Benadryl and then took another four hours later. I felt very light headed for the rest of the day. The light headedness and dizziness stayed for a few days with a headache. I did not have second dose on the recommendation of my doctor. I ended up contracted Covid-19 three weeks after the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the first vaccine, started experiencing a little neck pain and swelling on and off for 2 month since first vaccination on December 30th. After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

                                                throat swelling; uvula swelling; facial swelling; tongue swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A non-pregnant 33-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in right arm on 08Apr2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 33 years old) (Lot Number: EW0150, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included diabetes, HTN heart failure, migraine, and hypertension (HTN). Concomitant medications included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO PROVERA) taken from 07Apr2021 to an unspecified stop date; omeprazole (PRILOSEC); clarithromycin (CLARITIN); allopurinol (ELAVIL); magnesium; venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR); warfarin sodium (COUMADIN); digoxin; metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR); torsemide; acyclovir; aspirin; topiramate (TOPAMAX); insulin aspart (NOVOLOG); and atorvastatin.  The patient previously took bactrim and experienced allergies.  The patient experienced throat swelling, uvula swelling, facial swelling, and tongue swelling on 08Apr2021 at 10:00 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient received epinephirine, solumedrol, Pepcid, and Benadryl for the events.  It was unknown if the patient has COVID prior to vaccination and unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The patient is recovering from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pharyngeal swelling, enlarged uvula, swelling face and swollen tongue cannot be excluded. While a diagnosis was not provided, the clinical picture and treatment received by the patient point to the likelihood of an allergic reaction. The information available in this report is limited. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Extreme fatigue a couple hours after receive, maybe around  2p. Took a nap for maybe 2 hours, face started to feel itchy and tight. Around 8pm I look in the mirror and I notice my face looked a little puffy, and tiny bumps around my nose and mouth.  The next morning, around 5am, my eyelids and lips were noticeable swollen and the hives (tiny bumps) were covering my face, it was itchy mostly around my nose and mouth. I took Zyrtec every day for three days. The swelling went down after the second day, the hives (tiny bumps) cleared up around day three, my skin  was completely normal after about a week. On April 13, I started to feel fatigued ( same way I did after I got the vaccine on the 3rd),  the next morning my eyelid and lips were swollen and hives and itchness returned. I contacted doctor and he suggested taking Allegra 24 during the day and Benadryl at night ) if I?m itchy. He almost prescribed prednisone for 3 days,but only take  if my face was still swelling the next day.  On the 14th, my face was still swelling so I started the prednisone. It took about 4 days for my face to clear up completely

Four days after the vaccine I had very tender lymph nodes on the left ear area. Today marks two weeks exactly since I received the vaccine and two days ago I noticed slight increase in numbness on the left cheek again which again, is slowly improving.  However, I also wear Invisalign at sometimes notice that I bite my cheek while asleep. I also wear N95 masks four days of the week which are quite tight on the face.   The injection site (Left deltoid) was moderately sore for the first few days and still two weeks later has minor soreness the comes and goes.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

Normal is 110s/60s-70s. No anxiety feelings.  -0740 throat started to have increased mucous production. Had the tickle and tightness in throat. Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it. Didn&#39;t want to take that when I knew I was about to get it in the ER and knowing self hadn&#39;t progressed that far. Felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

A 34-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot: EJ1685, expiry date: Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, anxiety. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) for asthma, venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) for anxiety. The patient had noticed redness and swelling around the injection site. It doesn&#39;t seem like an infection but a typical reaction. This happened to the patient on day 8 post vaccination (06Jan2021). She also reported itchiness, injection site and armpit swelling since last night (06Jan2021). She had her vaccine on 29Dec2020 and then the last night (06Jan2021) it started itching and it is a little swollen. It is like the injection site reaction but she did not know it was normal this far after getting it. Like she was just curious that sort of reaction is normal this far after getting the vaccine. Events outcome was unknown.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine at approximately 9:15am on Thursday, January 14, 2021 in my right arm.  Almost immediately, I felt a pain go down to my wrist and across my chest. We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

                                                First day after, 23rd, arm was pretty sore. 24th it was fine. Going in to the 25th - getting difficult to walk; joints were very rigid. Both hips and both knees and ankles -whole lower body very rigid. Muscles were really tight and tense. It felt like all muscles were engaged stiff and wouldn&#39;t relax. Joints wouldn&#39;t bend (butt on down). I couldn&#39;t walk. During the day on 25th those symptoms still persisted but could walk a little - very challenging - couldn&#39;t ambulate well and it was painful to walk. Day of 26th and symptoms could still persisted and seemed like the morning wasn&#39;t as bad but by evening it was really bad again. I didn&#39;t equate it to the vaccine because on the 24th I felt fine. 28th I tried to work but left early to go to Dr because I had trouble walking that entire shift.  Dr ran tests - Lyme Disease and CBC and SED rate and Rapid Strep test and Antistreptolycin - if any antibody in body for strep; rheutomoid factor ; TSH; C reactive protein; Uric Acid; pathology for Lyme Serology  IG/IGG; ANA with Pathology - all was C reactive proteins was elevated - Put on Prednisone Pack and that made it better until most symptoms resolved and I felt like I could move again. I ran out on a Sunday and by Monday I back to not being able to move again. Got blood drawn Wednesday (Jan 6, 2021). And they rechecked CBC, SED rate; C reactive proteins and rheumotoid factor; CCP antibodies; and they did a comprehensive metabolic panel. And those were all normal except C reactive proteins was elevated but not as much as initial test. A week later added CK test - tested for muscle breakdown and that was normal  Jan 6, 2021 - meloxicam was prescribed and that managed most of my symptoms but I can only use Tylenol with and not Ibuprofen (which doesn&#39;t work as well).    Urgent care initially went to.

                                                On 1/16/2020 the patient was noted to have erythema on her hand which she noted was pruritic. She noted additional swelling and discomfort and 2 days later area was raised, red/purple and noted as painful and itchy. She sought out help from a physician who noted the area as possible cellulitis and prescribed cephalexin. 2 days later the patient reported to Urgent Care noting more pain and worsening swelling at the site on her Right palm. It was also noted she had a swollen, red lesion on the Right side of her back adjacent to her right scapula.  The patient was diagnosed with shingles and was started on Valtrex.  Due to timeline and closeness to vaccination dose, consideration of an immune modulated reaction.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

                                                On Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and swollen lymph nodes in my neck/collarbone area. As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

After about 20 minutes my face and lips became numb, my cheeks turned red and hot to the touch, my face started to swell and it felt like my blood pressure dropped, I became dizzy. I took 50mg of Benadryl within 30 minutes of the initial onset of symptoms. All symptoms were gone within an hour of taking the benadryl. Over the next couple hours I experienced discomfort/soreness at the injection site and that tattoo on the same arm as the injection site became raised, hot and itchy. As of 3/3/2021 the only symptom remaining is the soreness at the injection site.

Soon started a high fever of 103.6. Also had body aches, headache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, left lymph nodes in left arm pit are visible swollen and painful . The pain was so severe that I could not stop moving my legs. On a scale of 1-10, my overall pain level was at a 7. If I had not just had the COVID vaccine, I would have gone to the emergency room with how bad the symptoms were. The next morning all of the symptoms had subsided except for the swollen lymph nodes in my left arm pit. They are still visibly swollen, aching, and painful to the touch. They are so swollen they are restricting movement of my arm.

                                                Horrible headache started a few hours after injection with nausea, but backed off by next morning. By Saturday, the headache was back with the nausea and I began feeling very itchy. When I woke on Sunday, I had hives and a rash all over my face and most of my left side, which is the side I got my shot. Called Dr Monday and was sent to urgent care, who then sent me to the ER. Heart rate was high, hives, rash, headaches, nausea, swollen eyes and face, swollen lymph nodes

Unkown if related. It?s very rare for me to vomit.  Unable to get around well. Right knee pain which caused limping and not being about to walk at times. (Previous history of knee pain, but not for years). As of now I still have these symptoms besides chest pain and vomiting.

Discomfort and feeling of swelling continued through Sunday evening. Monday (3/15/21) patient began using compression stocking and elevating leg, which eased some discomfort. Slight swelling, discomfort, and heat in the leg continued throughout entire week. DVT presumed. Contacted physician. Treatment for DVT and treatment dosage (Fondaparinux 7.5mg) commenced Wednesday (3/17/21) through to date. Discomfort has dissipated but slight swelling still remains. Appears to be getting better each day, although a very slow progression. Patient history of antiphospholipid syndrome has been managed for over fifteen years with blood thinners. Onset of a clotting event always followed a justifiable cause. No spontaneous/unexplainable clotting events to date. Patient otherwise healthy without any other current event which could explain a blood clot following vaccination.

                                                This reaction has occurred twice since my first vaccination.  One at 9 days post vaccine and the other at 20 days post vaccine.   Sudden onset of a hot, swollen, mildly itchy red lacy rash over several areas of the body starting with the face. My face turned bright red and splotchy and was very hot. Then it spread to my neck and chest, then my arms, elbows, and hands, then to my stomach and thighs and butt. I took 2 Benadryl within ten minutes of each reaction starting and the rash slowly disappeared over the next 30 minutes after taking the medicine. No residual rash was left after the reaction.   The rash appeared on an empty stomach both times and without any environmental triggers. No other trigger has been identified.  No other bodily systems were involved in the reaction other than the skin.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

Her lungs remained CTA and she was otherwise as before.  The emergency room only gave famotidine 20 mg to her and discharged her with an EpiPen to use at home (they specifically felt she did not need it in the ER), but gave her oral cetirizine 10 mg to take daily for the next few days.  I asked her how she felt upon discharge from the ER and she felt fine/normal.

Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

                                                swollen lymph node, right side of neck; caused pain when swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professoonal (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Dec2020 11:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic asthma and allergy to animal dander, mold, pollen. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR), and OTC vitamins. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took erythromycin and experienced drug allergy to erythromycin. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. 1 day after vaccination, on 30Dec2020 08:00, the patient woke up with swollen lymph node, right side of neck.

She has numbness and loss of sensation in whole left side of body, limp and sluggish.  Went to ER 01/18/20 and they thought was overload of immune system.  They suggested her to report.  Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

The following day (01/23) I felt tired throughout the day. I went to work and when I got home my whole body began to ache (especially my legs) and my lymph nodes were swollen again. This morning (01/24) I woke up physically feeling warm but I was heat seeking and had a fever of 100.8F and was dizzy. Currently my temperature is 98.6 and aside from a mild headache and a very sore left arm/axillary area I feel better.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

                                                I am a 35yo G2P1, was 29 weeks pregnant at the time of vaccination (due 3/25/21), completely normal pregnancy so far. CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

By 24 hours post-vaccine, I developed a fever of 100.8, a headache, and swollen lymph nodes.  By 36 hours, my fever broke, diarrhea discontinued, and the headache subsided.  The body aches, nausea, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes continue to inhibit my ability to perform ADLs and I was unable to work today.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

That night I had chills, fever, full body joint pain, nausea, heavy head feeling, muscle pain and left arm pain at injection site.  The next day I had severe painful swollen lymph nodes to left clavicle and under left arm. Second night I had ongoing fever, chills, muscle pain, fatigue and overall feeling under the weather.  7 days after I had right leg pain from thigh to ankle.  Till today I still have generalized fatigue and swollen lymph nodes (although they are smaller that before)

                                                I got the shot on a Friday night at 5pm. I experience the arm pain in my left arm through out the top of my arm , by the end of  that night. By Saturday evening most of the pain was gone from that site. Late Saturday night I started noticing some pain in the arm pit on the left arm, didn&#39;t think much about it. By Sunday mid morning the pain was just getting more severe. Started to pay close attention to the side effects of the vaccine to realize that I most likely had swollen lymph nodes. The pain continued through the following Wednesday, when the pain started to not be as bad. I still to this day have some pain in the lymph nodes. I have contacted my doctor and was told to just monitor the site to make sure nothing is worse. That these reactions are common. I also have some soreness in my upper arm under where the shot was given, that I&#39;m not sure if it is from the shot or the muscle compensating from the soreness of the swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wed night 1/31/21 at 5:50pm. I had no prior recent illnesses prior to getting the shot. About 24 hours later, developed fevers/chills, body aches, headaches, and fatigue, and a notable pain in the front of neck -- felt like tender thyroid. Temp was 100.3F on Thursday night 1/14. Took ibuprofen and went to bed. Next day felt fine, went to work, but symptoms returned on Friday night without fever. Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.

                                                about a 1.5 weeks after first dose, I noticed my left hand felt swollen but didn&#39;t look swollen. I felt joint pain in my body but mostly my finger joints and wrist.  Left hand strength had become weak and couldn&#39;t put any weight in it or grip. After 12 hrs the swollen feeling went away.  The next day I noticed my index finger on left hand was very swollen but my hand didn&#39;t feel swollen like the day before.  2 days later I noticed my middle finger on the left hand was swollen. After 12 hours, the swelling is gone.  The next week I notice my middle finger on the right hand was swollen.  My hands are unable to make a fist when swollen feeling.  Now both of my hands are swollen.  A hot shower helps and sometime Motrin.

                                                3 days after the first dose was received, rashes developed under my chin and necks area with itching, and stinging sensation.  The symptoms went away a couple days later.  The same symptoms would appear a couple more times spacing out about 2- 3 weeks after the initial reaction.  Then on 2/17/2021, the same symptoms appear again but this time it would spread out to my entire neck and also my face. Symptoms included facial swelling, redness, blisters, along with stinging, burning, and itching sensation.  I did not crossed my mind that it was a reaction, but come to think of it, all of these happened after the vaccinations.  I did seek medical treatment on 2/18/21 and was treated with steroid pack. Although the medication treatment regime had completed, I still have symptoms of itchiness under my chin and neck as well as the rashes are still visible.

After second dose of Pfizer symptoms did not really develop immediately but noticed 3 weeks after symptoms returned. The symptoms seem to come and go and do not know if they have fully resolved yet.

                                                On 2/26/21 my left eye started to itch, burn, and the eye felt drier than normal. On 2/27/21 there was a noticeable red patch on the eyelid with small scaly looking spots, I assumed it to be a patch of dry skin. There was a 30 minute period of intense tingling pain and shooting/stabbing intermittent pain. There was also some numbness later on that day. Also on 2/27/21 I noticed a large lymphnode swelling on my jawline adjacent to my left ear. On 3/1/21 I saw my primary care provider and was diagnosed with shingles. After reviewing the preliminary symptoms of shingles, I had been experiencing abnormal fatigue and stomach upset for about 5 days prior to the eruption.

A 35-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 14:30 (2:30 PM) at single dose on left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is hospital. No history of previous immunization and no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect, also reported as &#34;Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None&#34;. Medical history included ongoing Vitamin D deficiency for quite a few years.  Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) from Oct2020 and ongoing at 50000 IU gel cap, once weekly for Vitamin D deficiency. Patient is scheduled to receive the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021 but reported side effects from her first shot including bruising near the injection site, shortness of breath, muscle tenderness and elevated heart rate (main concern). Upon contacting her HCP, she mentioned that this may be a side effect of her anxiety medications and asked &#34;Should she take the second dose?&#34;. Approximately 22hours (13Jan2021) after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. COVID-19 vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy, also experienced blood pressure increased, shortness of breath and Clammy, all on 13Jan2021. The patient was pale on 13Dec2020. Patient noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) that the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender (onset reported as &#34;Jan2021&#34;). Patient became sweaty on 14Jan2021. It was further reported that patient received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021 2:30PM . She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site. She said her COVID-19 Vaccine was given a lot higher than she thinks the vaccine should have been given. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy. Her heart rate and blood pressure shot up, and she had pretty bad shortness of breath. Patient said that the medical doctor and nurse practitioner (where she works) told her she gave herself a panic attack. She said that the medical doctor, who she works for, told her to go home, and to contact her primary care doctor if she doesn&#39;t feel better. Patient left work and went home. Patient clarified her heart rate was in the 120s, and she usually has a heart rate in the 80s. She said she was pale and clammy, too. Patient stated that she went to bed when she got home from work on 13Jan2021, and woke up the next morning (Thursday, 14Jan2021), and got ready for work. She said as she was getting dressed for work, she felt her pulse rate go up, and she became sweaty, and clammy. She said she called her work, and her boss (medical doctor) told her to take some Tylenol and rest, and to call her primary care doctor if she was not feeling better. Patient said that her primary care doctor said she was having anxiety, and started her on medicine. She said the medicine helped, but her heart rate was still 112-115. She said she noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender. She said all the muscles in her left arm were tender, as well. She said her left arm muscles were still aching. She said she had bruising on her left arm, and noticed she had bruising (more than usual) throughout the rest of her body. She said she has no idea if the bruising is a coincidence, or if the bruising is related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned that her left axillary lymph nodes were swollen for a good week and a half, but the swelling improved and was gone now. She said her heart rate was still elevated at 106-110 when she last checked her heart rate an hour and half ago.

She said it will be 3 weeks from tomorrow (03Feb2021) she has been taking the Buspar 7.5mg and reported everyone seems to think she has anxiety, or she was crazy. Events did not require emergency room visit but patient visited physician office. There were no relevant tests. Outcome of muscles in her left arm were tender/aching, was not recovered, for axillary lymph nodes swelling and tender was recovered in 2021, for heart rate was elevated, Shortness of breath/breathing discomfort was recovering while for other events was unknown.

Then I went to the ER and they have me a steroid and  Pepcid. I went home, and I was still very itchy. Then I went to urgent care and they repeated the treatment and I was fine by the 3rd day. I went to see my allergist and he wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to the vaccine. I was instructed to take the 2nd dose, but to take meds first. I took antihistamines before 2nd dose and I was fine.

When I woke up the next day, I was in some discomfort around my collarbone and felts a small lump. I waited until Wednesday and did a virtual visit with a doctor and they said it is probably the lymph nodes. There has been no change in the size of the lump nor has it moved to a new spot.

The only reason I did not use my Epipen was the fact that I could still breathe through this, even if it was a bit labored. I should add that my reaction began 1.5 hours after I was vaccinated. I?ve been managing having life threatening allergies since I was a child, but this reaction resembled nothing I?ve ever experienced.  After using 50 mg of Benadryl, my symptoms were manageable. The pain at the injection site lasted for five days and caused intermittent numbness to my pinky finger and up my neck.

On the fifth day I had a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and a migraine like headache followed by the chills. These symptoms repeated two to four times daily for four days. I also had low grade abdominal cramping which is ongoing. I am unsure whether this is contractions or abdominal problems. I communicated with my Obstetrician and my GI doctor. My water broke at 21 weeks, but I did not lose the baby. I am currently 22 weeks pregnant and on bed rest.  I was hospitalized for four days.

This consumer reported events for mother (self) and child. This is the maternal report.   A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Apr2021 12:15, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a drug store. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no prior COVID-19 and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. Concomitant medication included minerals nos, vitamins nos (PRENATAL VITAMINS). The patient did not received other vaccines in four weeks. On 07Apr2021 at 03:00, the patient went to the bathroom and felt fine. She sat on the toilet and all of a sudden felt dizzy and nauseous. Next thing she knew, she woke up on the floor and had a huge bump on her head near her left eye. She passed out and hit her head on the tile in the bathroom. Her left eye was half swollen shut, her eyelid and under eye were black, was very swollen all over her head and eye and was in lots of pain. She went to the emergency room around 04:30. All tests, CT scan and blood work came back normal. She was told that it was most likely caused by the vaccine. Treatment for the events included &#34;CT scan, bloodwork, IV fluids&#34; (as reported). She was hoping that Pfizer will pay for her ER visit since the events were vaccine reactions. She reported that she was still in lots of pain and was not taking pain meds because she was breastfeeding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician office visits. The outcome of pain was not recovered. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021442302 Baby case

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

                                                Injection received at 0815. At 0900 I started getting diaphoretic, clammy, nauseas and my face was flushed. At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

Flushing of hands; Dizziness; Fatigue; Legs became heavy; Joint stiffness of hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ 1685), intramuscular on the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 AM in a hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies of seasonal allergies, cats, and metals; migraines, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and angioedema. The patient was not pregnant and did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination and did not test positive to COVID post vaccination (also reported as not been tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination). Concomitant medication included propranolol, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), and sertraline (reported as other medications in two weeks). On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID 19, brand: Pfizer) lot no: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had no relevant medical history and no known allergies. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination, last menstrual date was on 05Oct2020, delivery date will be on 12Jun2021, gestation period: 11.  Concomitant medication includes daily multivitamin. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 30Dec2020 04:00 am, 7 days after vaccine (as reported), a large mass appeared in right axilla. The mass was painful to touch. Overnight mass more than doubled in size on 31Dec2020 the mass took up her entire arm pit, went to immediate care and was given antibiotics. The mass decreased in size but has not gone away. She followed up with primary care. She had bloodwork and ultrasound of axilla and right breast. Blood work was normal. Ultrasound showed a few enlarged and abnormal lymph nodes believed to be reactive in nature. Largest lymph node as of 08Dec2020 2.5 x 0.9 x 2.2 cm. The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Later in the evening I had the same feeling in my left leg and in my cheeks, lips, tongue and teeth. I felt like I had been numbed at the dentist, but was coming out of the numbness. It was like when the numbness is mostly gone and you&#39;re left with that tingling sensation, and your face feels puffy. It was basically that feeling in my face, left leg, and left arm. Those sensations are mostly gone today (the second day following), but not quite.

A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 11Jan2021 15:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chronic allergies, gastritis, and walnut allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), metformin, loratadine (CLARITINE), spironolactone, and calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 21Dec2020 15:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related but I figured I should report just in case. I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine. 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough. By sudden onset, I mean I had no desire to cough and over about 30 min I developed the severe need to cough. My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks. I&#39;ve never experienced such a violent cough with so much sudden sputum production. I am using an Albuterol inhalor to help chest tightness.&#34; Clinical outcome of chest discomfort was unknown while for the other events was not recovered.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

However at 7pm I could feel something strange spreading across my face.  My left side of my face became numb and swollen.  I went to urgent care the next day and they said I had inflammation in my facial nerve and prescribed me prednisone.  I&#39;ll be on the prednisone for another 8 days, tapering.  My face and head have continued to be numb and swollen.  Today for the first time, it feels a little better.  Today is a week since I received the vaccine.

                                                I received my vaccine at 1:10pm. As I was waiting afterwards, I started getting really itchy around 1:25pm. I have a lot of medicinal allergies and this is my normal response when I have a reaction. The itching gradually got worse and some swelling started as well. Around 1:45pm my throat started swelling and I was having trouble swallowing. This continued to get worse, so I stopped at the ER on my way home. I was given Benadryl in an IV and observed for 2 hours. The swelling in my throat went down by 2:45, but the itchiness continued until around 5pm. That evening, the only symptom left was fatigue.

At 7 minutes after my vaccination,  I approached EMS to report my symptoms to EMS. EMS did an exam and said my lymnode on my left side was a little swollen. Pharmacist took my name and number for contact information. Benadryl (25 mg) was given to me from the Giant Eagle Pharmacist  after seeing EMS at 8:55 AM. Waited an additional 30 minutes with EMS to monitor symptoms. Symptoms decreased in severity after Benadryl  (25 mg) was given.  ?Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;

It was non painful at first, but now it is tender. It is roughly the size of an egg/golf ball. I also have tenderness on my chest  above my right breast but on the pectoralis muscle. Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

This has been occurring since after receiving the first vaccine, with increased severity after the second.  The symptoms last from 20-2 hours after exposure and then resolve.

A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported) (at 36 years of age), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included multiple sclerosis (MS) and allergy to nickel. Concomitant medication included interferon beta-1a (AVONEX), buprenorphine hydrochloride, naloxone hydrochloride (SUBOXONE), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), and bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN). The patient previously took REGLAN [metoclopramide] and experienced allergy. Historical vaccine included PFIZER BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE first dose (at 36 years of age) on 02JAN2021 08:30 AM via unknown route of administration in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant. She had not had other vaccine in four weeks prior to covid vaccine. She had no covid prior vaccination and she was not tested for covid post vaccination. The patient experienced swelling of the lymph nodes (mid neck/clavicle area) in the same arm as the injection on 25Jan2021 with outcome of recovering. There was no treatment received for the events. The event resulted to Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.  Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.

Second day my whole body felt stiff.  Third day I started getting shortness of breath.  Fourth day I woke up with swollen itchy eyes and ears as well as a sore throat.  It started to become even harder to breath.  I took allergy medicine, Allegra and zertex and felt some immediate relief.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

                                                Covid toes, red tender slightly swollen toes with mild purple discoloration at the tip of toes, developed 3 days after receiving the first vaccine dosage in the series.  I have tested negative for covid as of 1/10/21.  It was initially thought that I had a skin infection from clipping my nails too short and was prescribed doxyclycline. I saw an improvement within a few days on the antibiotic but them saw a reappearance of the covid toes presenting symptoms on 1/8/21. I have since been told by a physician that I likely have covid toes and not a bacterial infection. I was told to take baby asprin and that is helping to reduce the symptoms.   In the past few weeks I have had no symptoms of Covid besides the appearance of covid toes. I understand that covid toes are often a latent symptom and that the timing of the appearance of this symptom could be coincidental. I am mildly concerned that the first vaccine dosage could have caused a flair up of a potential previous covid infection or could have caused the red covid toes symptom itself.

A 37-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 19Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included celiac, anxiety depression, ADHD, cold sores sometimes, secondary infertility, seasonal allergies, sulfa allergy.

Then on my third day (22Jan2021) she woke up and still had the left armpit pain and swelling and now she was getting intermittent sharp zapping pains on her left side of her external Obliques. She could not find anything online about the armpit pain and swelling and the Obliques pain. She was a nurse also and just wanted reassurance her that this was normal she was gonna get better. No treatment was received for the events. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a hospital.

About 10 days after the first injection, I felt a tingling in my lip and a cold sore erupted. Then another! I&#39;ve never had 2 at the same time. One on the top lip and one on the bottom. I haven&#39;t had a cold sore in 15 years. I had my 2nd titer on February 3rd. On February 15th I had another eruption of another cold sore.  I didn&#39;t think the first recurrence of a cold sore was linked to the vaccine, but the timing of the 2nd one is beyond coincidental, which is why I&#39;m reporting it. Abreva is not helping too much. I haven&#39;t had a herpes breakout since 2006.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination the entire left hand side of my face went numb as if I&#39;d had a dental procedure (I was injected on the left side). The nurses on site looked me over and said I was ok to go home at the end of my wait time.  The effect faded as the day went on and was gone the next morning. I was vaccinated on a Tuesday morning and on the following Thursday morning I woke up with swelling covering almost my entire bicep area on the side I was vaccinated. The area is about 8 inches by 4 inches. It is swollen, red, hard to the touch, painful and mildly itchy.  As of today (Friday) it has gotten a couple of inches bigger and not improved at all.

                                                Day of vaccine (Tues 3/9): Mild headache, injection site soreness.  I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s related, but I couldn&#39;t really focus on work-related tasks - I don&#39;t know if it was just the nervousness of waiting for side effects or what.  Day after vaccine (Wed 3/10): Mild headache that came and went through the day (I took acetaminophen in the early evening), tiredness, injection site soreness (noticed bruise forming), and felt &#34;off&#34; - not quite nauseated, but not normal self.  Same lack of focus/productivity.  Two days after vaccine (Thur 3/11): No headache, injection site soreness waning (but bruise is bigger), not as tired, better focus, but in the evening, I felt a hard rounded node above my collarbone (about two fingers wide).  Freaked out, Googled it, saw swollen lymph nodes on side of vaccine site is somewhat typical.  Appears to be my left supraclavicular lymph node and if you look hard enough, you can visibly see the left side is slightly swollen.  I cannot feel any other swollen lymph nodes.  Today (Fri 3/12):  Bruised injection site, and this swollen, hard lymph node is quite sore.  Other than that, I feel fine at the moment.

About  01:00, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain. I had hives all over me. Hives were spreading all over my body: hair; arm with the injection; we called 9-1-1 I went to the hospital. They gave me some meds through IV. By that time, I had taken Bendryl and I was there about 4 hours with IV. I felt better but hives didn&#39;t subside. That Sunday afternoon they started getting worse again and I went back to the hospital  (16th)and they gave me rounds of something through IV.  On 17th, I went back to hospital - they gave me another shot for the hives. I worked on the 18th - but was they said I should go home because I didn&#39;t look well. My lip started swelling that night. On the 19th, I went to my doctor and the Dr, used an epi-pen on me and gave me a shot of something for the  welts still on my body. They still didn&#39;t go away.  Symptoms have calmed down - but I still have spots on me. I am on Prilosec and anti-itch - Atarax and some others.

She was given 25 mg cap Benadryl PO and assistance was called when her heart rate reached 150 BPM about a minute later and further climbed to 188 BPM. She was transported to the Emergency Department where she was administered epinephrine, lorazepam, methylprednisolone, racepinephrine, and lactated ringers. She spent several hours in the Emergency Department and was discharged home but returned later that night at 06:00 PM for return of symptoms (tachycardia: 185 BPM, anxiety) and was administered Benadryl, solumedrol, Pepcid, Ativan, and Lactated Ringers. She was diagnosed with acute allergic reaction, nascent anaphylaxis, and panic attack. She went home again after this second ED visit.  On Monday, 1/4/21, the patient reported to Employee Health with resumption of symptoms. Calming techniques were discussed and she went to a quiet area for 15 minutes to compose herself. Employee Health Nurse referred patient to Employee Assistance Program for anxiety care.

I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

Collarbone areas are visibly different due to swelling. Most symptoms resolved within 36 hours of second dose of Pfizer vaccine. However, swollen lymph node in left clavicle area has continued to get more painful and swollen. Will seek medical treatment if this does not resolve.

                                                The day after I had the shot, i started to itch on my left arm , around the area I had the shot,,and then it developed into a rash like situation on both arms...the itching was so intense and then i noticed tiny bumps  and black and blue spots along my right and left arm.  It then spread to my thighs and upper chest area. I also had tightness in my throat and i took some Benadryll over the weekend hoping it would go away but it didn&#39;t. It got worse. On Monday, it was swollen on both arms and looked more like hives, red itchy with tiny bumps. On Tuesday, I went to my PCP who indicated it may have been an allergic reaction from the vaccine. She gave me Medrol and that is what I have been taking. Today the itching is a little less intense ..

I slept fairly well on Thursday evening. When I woke up on Friday morning, I had a pounding headache and my body ached. I was still sluggish and tired. Later that morning I also felt very nauseous. Pain relievers did not seem to help relieve any of my symptoms. I also had chills throughout the day. My arm and armpit hurt very bad throughout the day as well. Friday evening I did not sleep well. I was sweating and my body ached all over. Nothing seemed to provide relief. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I still had chills, body aches and a headache.  Pain relievers did seem to help. By about 2pm I started feeling better and like myself again.   Today is Monday and I do still have a sore arm and armpit. My armpit is swollen.

Wasn&#39;t any better and lost my taste and smell for 3 days. Went to the Clinic, was tested for Covid-19 and the flu both negative. Went back to the Clinic and had chest x-ray, diagnosed with right middle lobe pneumonia.  Sent home with doxycycline and zofran. Took the Medication as directed. Still feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and still winded and extremely tired after doing the slightest bit of house work, whether it would be sweeping the floor, doing dishes, or laundry. I get extremely after doing one activity. I still have not driven.

                                                I had terrible insomnia and the worst headache Wednesday night. When I finally went to sleep I tossed and turned and was cold and hot. I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

                                                On Tuesday the 29th I noticed I had an enlarged Lymph node on my left clavicle.  I wanted my Doctor to check it out, it didn&#39;t hurt but was 2cm, I did  concern me. It is gone now.  My Doctor said it looked like was caused from the vaccine and didn&#39;t look cancerous. She ordered some  bloodwork, chest x-ray , CBC and everything came back negative. It went away in about two weeks.

The knot and size keeps increasing for nearly a full week-still has a fever, hot to the touch, and very hard. The injection site is not sore. I&#39;m now at day 17 and I still have a golf ball size knot that I&#39;m very concerned about. It does not have a fever and the red swelling has gone away.

                                                The night of the side effects were normal, over all fatigue.  The next day my top, left upper lip started to go numb and swell, because of the timeline of the event and the lack of any other symptom I was not thinking allergic reaction, but took a benedryl just in case.  I feel asleep and woke up a couple hour later and the top upper lip swelling had started to go down, but my bottom lip had swollen and looked like a sausage.  At this point it was pretty late at night and figured the ER had bigger problems to deal with and this was either going to be better by morning or worse and would deal with it then.  When I woke up the next day I had some submental pain, but the swelling in my lip had gone down considerable.  At this point I noticed I had considerable pain in my collar bone, I felt the area, noticed a mass, went to the mirror and saw what looked like a golf ball under my skin at my collar bone.  My lymph nodes were completely swollen.  I went to urgent care who instructed me to follow up with my PCP if it didn&#39;t go down in a week, my PCP told me we would follow up with an ultrasound if it didn&#39;t go down in a month.  At this point this is getting ridiculous.  I understand that swollen lymph nodes are a side effect, but it should not be for a month.  This is causing me discomfort and gets worse the more I move around and on top of that I have been getting numbness in my left arm and hand which is what side the swollen lymph node is on.

She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

                                                Employee received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on January 18th at about 2pm.  By 6 pm, she noticed that she had bilateral swelling of lymph nodes in neck by the clavicle bone (more prominent on right hand side - same side as injection).  She also experienced difficulty swallowing and went to the ER at 9pm.  At the ER she received solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and was discharged with hydroxyzine, Pepcid, solumedrol dosepak, zofran and epi-pen. At this time she was diagnosed with angioedema.  Swelling persisted and she contacted an allergist who prescribed additional antihistamines.  The allergist advised to her take Zyrtec or Claritin in addition to hydroxyzine day and night. The swelling continued to persist and two weeks later after returning to work for one day, she experienced feeling hot and flushed on right side, increased swelling and difficulty swallowing again and returned to ER on 1/25/21 and was treated with solumedrol and hydroxyzine and was discharged with solumedrol dosepak in addition to continuing antihistamines.  Upon returning to allergist, she was advised to take 4 zyrtec, 4 Claritin, Pepcid 40mg bid and hydroxyzine 10mg at bedtime.  PCP referred her to oncologist. After CT, oncologist diagnosed condition as bilateral lymphadenopathy and to return in 3 months for follow up.  PMH significant for ALL as a child (8 yrs), went into remission at 13yrs. PMH also includes DM2.

I started to rub the arm. My arm became swollen, red, hard, warm to touch, itchy and painful to move. Later that night, I also felt something in my left forearm. I started using a cold pack. Morning of March 6th: right deltoid has not changed. Now alternating between heat and cold on arm. Evening of March 6th: left forearm feels like a sore muscle after exercising. I began to flex my wrist to stretch the muscle. My left forearm then became swollen, red, hard, warm to touch, itchy and painful to move.  Morning of March 7th: Went to urgent care. I was prescribed a cream and antibiotics and told to take an allergy pill. Morning of March 8th:  Right deltoid has lessened is swelling, redness, pain and itchy feeling.  I started to feel the sore muscle feeling in both calf muscles and right forearm. I did not stretch the muscle and it has not produced the same reaction.

I went to see my PCP and a CT scan of the right upper extremity was ordered. My CT scan diagnosis was lymphadenopathy. They then performed an U/S guided biopsy of my right upper extremity which was inconclusive. Since my report was  inconclusive, I now have to get a repeat biopsy and I am scheduled for 04-01-2021.  On 03-31-2021, I was also be going in for a marker place to demonstrate area concern for further diagnosis.

The pain in my back when clearing the throat shifted towards my spine, then started to radiate outward.  All symptoms gone except for soreness in the arm and the feeling in my cheeks. It feels like when you?ve been numbed by the dentist, and that numb tingly fades, but your mouth doesn?t feel awake.

                                                (note: I had no reaction to the first dose)  13 hours after receiving my second dose I had been in bed for a couple of hours unable to get comfortable because I felt weird. That?s when my ankles and feet began to itch. I checked for mosquito bites, none were there but I noticed that my ankles and feet were swollen. I applied a lotion recommended eczema  thinking my skin might be dry. Over the next hour the itching got worse and spread up my calves. That?s when I noticed that my tongue felt weird and kinda poofy. I?m used to occasional dry mouth due to my meds, but this was nothing like that. It freaked me out so I got up took Allegra hoping that on top of the Zyrtec I?d taken hours before would help. Since I was restless and desperately needed sleep  I took 1/2 of a 15mg trazadone tablet. That did the trip. No itching and I was able to sleep. Now I?ve been in bed all day with flu-like symptoms, I?m miserable and I?ve missed work. Unless I awake tomorrow morning feeling magically better I?ll miss work again.  The itching and swollen tongue  really freaked me out, hence my report today.

A 39-year-old female patient (nurse) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL8982, expiration date was unknown, NDC number), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 38 years on 18Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date were not reported) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) when she was 8 years old, but had been in remission since she was 13. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The pharmacy manager reported that the patient, who was one of her employees at the hospital, received her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 18Jan2021 and on an unspecified date had experienced lymphadenopathy afterwards that was still ongoing. The reporter described it as &#34;very impressive swelling&#34; at the base of neck that got inflamed when the patient got hot or stressed out, causing impacts on her swallowing. The reporter stated that the patient had gone to the emergency room twice, where it had been described as angioedema on an unspecified date and had also seen an allergist, who described it as a &#34;robust immune response.&#34; The reporter was concerned about the ongoing nature of this lymphadenopathy and would like any information that would help to treat this. The reporter also stated that the patient had gone through &#34;medical procedures and computerized tomography (CT) scans&#34; with unknown results on an unspecified date and would like to know if the patient would be eligible for the Program because of the event. The patient was in the group that got the vaccine first. The patient still had impressive lymphadenopathy and it was persisting. At first it was interfering with the patient&#39;s swallowing, but it was still occasionally interfering with her swallowing. The reporter was wondering if there was any more in house data that had been reported on this. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of angioedema, which included that the patient had been prescribed antihistamines, such as cetirizine (ZYRTEC), fexofenadine (ALLEGRA), hydroxyzine, famotidine (PEPCID), and methylprednisolone (MEDROL) dose packs. The patient was not recovered from the event &#34;lymphadenopathy,&#34; while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of angioedema, lymphadenopathy and other events  due to temporal relationship.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I woke up with severe abdominal pain. Diagnosed as appendicitis. The surgeon noted that it was severely gangrenous upon removal.  Please note that while one of the causes can just be from hardened fecal matter, I do not have any issues with bowel movements, am regular, and have soft bowel movements.   I did become quite ill with headache, nausea, aches for two and a half days after the second vaccine, and that was my only known illness occurring before the appendicitis. As a virus can cause appendicitis, I wonder if my reaction to vaccine led to this as is was 18 days after the shot. While is was not an immediate event, I would imagine it can take time for an appendix to be affected to the point mine was before it became acute.

                                                After initial dose of vaccine, eczema patch begun spreading up my arms (had only previously had it on my hands).  Some mild lymph node swelling and general fatigue between the first and second vaccine dose. After the second dose I had severe lymph node swelling (up to a baseball size lump under my arm). Within a week of the second dose, I was treated for a sinus infection (though had no symptoms such as congestion) with antibiotics and steroids. After going off steroids, the eczema rash that had occurred after the first shot cropped up again and spread from my scalp to my knees and was extremely itchy. I also had painful, swollen lymph nodes from my ears to collar bone. I was not wheezy, but was coughing and had a tight feeling in my chest frequently. I had to do 2 rounds of steroids, increase antihistamine doseage, and begin a steroid cream (topical). I also had to decrease my immunotherapy doseage significantly because I had more severe responses to my injections. My skin finally cleared after about 4 months though I am still having to take increased medication dosages and decreased immunotherapy doseages.

A 38-year-old [non-pregnant] adult female received the second dose of BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot unknown and expiry information not provided) as a single dose via unspecified route in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 10:00 (at 38-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Autoimmune Hashimoto&#39;s, penicillin allergy and known allergies to gluten, soy, dairy, wheat, malt and eggs. Concomitant medications sans therapy dates included levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT) for thyroid; and liothyronine sodium (CYTOMEL) for thyroid. The patient previously received Covid-19 immunisation with first dose of BNT162b2 (Lot unknown) in left arm on 30Mar2021 at 10:00 (at 38-years-old). The patient denied COVID-19 prior to the vaccine and the patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient denied receiving any other vaccine within four weeks prior to this vaccine. On 20Apr2021 at 12:00, reported as about one- and one-half hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient began to experience vaginal pain. The patient reported that she also experienced swollen lymph nodes under arm pit to enlarge, still have neck pain on left side where injection was administered. The patient explained that her labia majora are swollen, and the skin is sensitive to touch. The patient explained that she went to the emergency room (ER) because she could not walk or urinate as her vulva was irritated. The patient reported that the only thing that she did this week was get vaccinated and the ER diagnosis said she had an acquired disorder of genital organ and advised an obstetrical /gynecological consultation. The patient stated she never had this problem. The patient assessed the events serious (Disability or permanent damage). Relevant testing included a negative post-vaccination COVID-19 test via nasal swab on 20Oct2020 (as reported). There was unspecified treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events vaginal pain, swollen lymph nodes under arm pit to enlarge, neck pain on left side, labia majora are swollen, skin is sensitive to touch, vulva was irritated, was not recovered.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and  BNT162b2  vaccine cannot be completely excluded.

                                                Around 24 hours post COVID vaccination into her left delt,  she woke up with severe left shoulder and neck muscle pain. She got in touch with her provider and was treated with valium and Celebrex. She reported about 2 cm swelling and fatigue. Thirty hours post vaccination, she had pain and swelling and could barely move. Dr. needed to take valium and Celebrex though for those 48 hours, and would have gone to the ER if they had not helped (the pain was that debilitating)

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This is similar to the symptoms that I experience when I had fifths disease.

I had onset of fever, chills and body aches starting a 230 pm day after vaccine. My baby started having fever 2 hours later. I direct fed him about one hour and a half after receiving the vaccine. He had fever Max of 101.7 and has continued to have after 72hours. He had change in the stool consistency and smell  but not diarrhea. He had decrease intake today but otherwise asymptomatic. I?m a pediatrician. His physician exam is normal except for tiny lymph nodes palpable in his axila and inguinal área. Today I checked his urine dip and was negative. No other testing has been completed. Fever has been control easily with Tylenol and the last 2 doses I have chosen to give Motrin. Baby is well appearing, active and playful otherwise. No history of contacts. We have no social contact with anybody for months, no grocery shopping, use N95 when seeing patients but I?m mostly Telehealth. My 5 yo is virtual student and does not have any symptoms. My husband has received first dose Covid and is also asymptomatic. I don?t have any reason to think there is any other etiology rather than my vaccine administration. My symptoms resolved after 30hours. I only had mild arm pain with first dose and baby was completely asymptomatic

Then on Saturday night the body aches were progressively worse and concentrated on left side of body. Joints were affected including left wlbow, wrist, shoulder. Hot viral rash appeared on arm right above left elbow that became painful with swelling and  erythema. In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

This continued for 48 hours.  The swelling of the lymph node went down and the body and joint pain lessened.  However 5 days after I am still exhausted, dealing with a headache, my arm is still sore, and am experiencing joint pain and back pain.  I was diagnosed with COVID 19 on December 4, 2020, with COVID Pneumonia on Decemeber 13, 2020, and with Post Viral Syndrome on December 28, 2020.

I immediately reported my symptoms to the MD  that was in  the room monitoring the recent vaccinated employees. Immediately he administered 50mg of Benadryl,  20mg of Pepcid,  and salbutamol.  I was rushed to the ED and stayed there for couple of hours headed back to my unit and then sent home by my manager.

This 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiry date unknown), intramuscular in left deltoid in Jan2021 (reported as 06Jan2021 or 07Jan2021 at 11:30) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 on 16Dec2020 at around 19:30, intramuscular injection in left deltoid. A day after vaccination, since an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient&#39;s lymph nodes were swollen for 3 weeks at the time of report. The swelling went down some but was still very noticeable. Outcome of the event was recovering. Event did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, it was reported that the patient experienced &#34;a sense of her throat swelling&#34; and hives 1 hour after the vaccination occurred. The patient received 1 dose of Benadryl and Tylenol and &#34;felt ok.&#34; The physician commented that the patient did not have full anaphylaxis and was asking if it would be safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine at the time of report. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A non-pregnant 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at 39-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart murmur, Latex allergy; both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported; and no other medications were received within two weeks of the suspect vaccine. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced: felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side (non-serious), streaks of heat along the back of her scalp (non-serious), heat in her chest (non-serious), right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder (non-serious), hot flashes (non-serious). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient, ten minutes after the vaccination, felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side. This was followed by streaks of heat along the back of her scalp, and heat in her chest. After about an hour, the right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder. The patient&#39;s &#34;body stayed that way for about 20 hours.&#34; The patient also experienced hot flashes, which was not something that she ever had before. The patient feared getting the second dose because her body felt so off after the first dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination with the suspect vaccine.   The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Overnight Sunday to Monday, the lymph node in my armpit of the same arm became swollen and tender. I sent a note to my PCP through the Patient Portal so he was aware and could note it in my medical chart.   I know from researching this that a small percentage of people experience this side effect after receiving their COVID vaccination. While I will continue to monitor it, it should most likely resolve on its own over time (days to months).

                                                Immediately after injection I had a sore arm in a warm spot. And the following days I had a headache and felt very under the weather with a low-dose fever. On Saturday 3/20, I started to get achy muscles and joints. On 3/21, I had around five incidents of diarrhea. Today, 3/22 I called my doctor about the joint and muscle pain. We decided constantly taking ibuprofen for a few dates is the course of treatment for now.   I would consider it moderate pain, I?m struggling doing daily activities without pain intervention. Most of the pain is in my hips, knees, ankles, toes, and hands.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. After about 30 minutes, on 20Mar2021 09:00 AM, the patient experienced tongue started swelling and would not subside. She tried antihistamine all day with no success. She went to Urgent Care and received steroid shot and was prescribed prednisone that same evening. She was told to return if symptoms not improved in three days. The patient returned on Monday evening and was sent to the ER. She was diagnosed with Angioedema and given more antihistamines and steroid shot and epinephrine in IV. The patient was currently monitoring and seeing an allergist to follow up. Her tongue was still not back to normal. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of tongue started swelling and would not subside was not recovered, and of angioedema was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient had not been been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. No follow-up attempts are possible; information on the batch/lot number cannot be obtained.

The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021.

The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Mild anaphylaxis--tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway; This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot was unknown due to not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at age of 39-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eczema, known allergies: Food sensitives including gluten and dairy. Rashes with prolonged skin contact with metals or adhesives. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID was not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylaxis-tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway on 19Mar2021. Started about 2min after shot. Occlusion lasted for 7minutes. EMS said vitals were normal. Swollen tongue lasted 24 hours. Have never had an allergic response to any vaccine before. The events were non-serious. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of anaphylaxis was recovered in 2021, of tongue swelling was recovered on 20Mar2021, of occlusion of airway was recovered on 19Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event anaphylaxis cannot be totally excluded.

A 39-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN16208) at the age of 39-years-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant. Medical history included Hormonal Acne, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included spironolactone taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium alginate (PEPCID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took cefalexin monohydrate (KEFLEX) and experienced allergy. The patient initially had some intermittent numbness/tingling of her inner upper lip that began within the first hour of receiving the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and lasted about 24 hours. Six days following vaccination on 25Mar2021, the patient began having muscle cramps/muscle soreness in her lower extremities that progressed to her upper extremities and neck, By the eighth day on 27Mar2021, she had developed numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet. On this day, she also began having muscle weakness and was unable to walk unassisted by the end of the day. She was seen in the Emergency room (ER), admitted, and transferred to another facility. The patient hospitalized for 1 day. She underwent a Computerised tomogram (CT) scan of my head, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of my brain/neck, lumbar puncture, and extensive blood work. All of her work up was unremarkable except for showing that she had a Vitamin D deficiency. Her symptoms began to improve without treatment in the hospital, and she was discharged home with the diagnosis that she had most likely had an unusual, adverse reaction to her 1st dose of the COVID 19 vaccine and was instructed not to receive my 2nd dose. Covid tested post vaccination (Nasal swab) on 28Mar2021: Negative. The outcome of the events &#39;numbness/tingling of my inner upper lip&#39; was recovered on 20Mar2021 and the outcome of the other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported Myalgia, Muscle cramps, Hypoasthesia, Parasthesia, Pheripheral swelling, Muscle weakness and Vitamin D Defiency.

                                                lips starting to swell like a balloon (angioedema); headache; chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other hcp (patient).   A 39-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age of 39 years old, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: ER8729) at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient medical history was not reported. Known allergies was None.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Mar2021 (age of 39 years old)(Lot Number: EN6208) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had 2nd vaccine on 10Apr2021 at 01:30 PM, woke up 11Apr2021 11:00 AM with headache and chills, then around 11 noticed lips starting to swell like a balloon (angioedema). No hives. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Outcome for events was recovering. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the angioedema.
