After 48 hours I had a lot of pain in my injection arm and my armpit lymph nodes were swollen. I treated the pain with Advil and a heating pad. 72 hours after the vaccine I felt faint, dizzy, and nauseous. I began to vomit and have diarrhea that entire night and next morning. I felt very weak and was unable to keep any foods or liquids down. I was unable to walk around. I took Zofran 8mg which helped with the severe nausea and weakness.  These symptoms are ongoing.

                                                On 01/07/2021 I woke up  at 0300am with chills, headache, body aches, joint pain, fever of 101.2 and swollen left axillary lymph nodes. I took Tylenol and Benadryl and it relieved the fever/headache/body aches/joint pain, however the lymph nodes in my left axillary remained swollen. I continue to take Tylenol for the fever/body aches/pains without relief for the swollen and painful axillary lymph nodes. Warm  compresses do help to relieve the pain temporarily but they remain painfully swollen. On 01/08/21 I called my doctors office to ask if it was normal to experience such painfully swollen axillary lymph nodes to which they stated ?we don?t know, it is too soon for us to tell what?s normal and what isn?t normal right now.? They did not offer any suggestions to relieve the pain or swelling. The morning of 01/09/2021 , I called Employee Health at my hospital (my place of work and also where I received the vaccine) and they also stated they didn?t know if this was a normal reaction due to the newness of the vaccine. A couple hours later, employee health emailed me a link to the VAERS reporting website and asked me to file a report.

                                                Patient developed angioedema of her eyelids after COVID-19 vaccination.  She received her Covid vaccine on 1/10/2021 at 11:30 AM.  She received the Pfizer vaccine.  She works at a nursing home.  She had some fatigue and tiredness during the day but woke up on the second day without any symptoms.  On 1/30/2021, she developed bilateral eyelid swelling.  The swelling is mild to moderate intensity involving the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally with a prickly burning sensation associated with pruritus.  The reaction lasted less than a day and resolved without any skin desquamation, scarring or bruising.  She denies any hives anywhere else.  She does not have a large local reaction at the injection site.  She denies respiratory complaints, GI symptoms, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, wheezing, swelling of her throat or other symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis.  She used Benadryl with significant improvement.   She had a significant reaction after influenza vaccination consisting of swelling of her face and her eyelids with development of dry patches bilaterally within 2 days, resolving with skin desquamation.  The reaction lasted for 1 week.  She received her influenza vaccination in October 20, 2020.   She was seen in our office in 2012 for bilateral eyelid angioedema with associated urticaria shortly after swimming in the pool.  She was given oral antihistamines ?Zyrtec once daily? with significant improvement as well as prevention of this reaction.  She has not had this reaction  for more than 6 years.

A 26-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number= ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: cephalosporins, coconut. Other medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at time of 05:00 AM, the patient experienced blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine and continuing into day 4 DOST vaccine, swollen lymph nodes under bilateral arms that had not decreased, chills and sweating, headache. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post vaccination which included COVID nasal swab test and COVID PCR test, both were negative on 14Jan2021. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 2 minutes after injection, I had a sudden rush of warmth throughout my body starting in my abdomen then causing my pulse to feel like it was pounding out of my neck. Got light headed. EMS came and my blood pressure raised to 155/95 and my pulse was up in the 150s and I was shaking.  Started to go down but felt crappy for over 2 hours. Happened again 30seconds after the second injection. Pulse up to almost 160. 02 stats stayed normal. Post first injection had sore arm and lots of fatigue and brain fog. Following the second injection 12 hours post started having nausea, and diarrhea. Continued to have joint pain, muscle aches, headaches for days, and my lymph nodes swelled up and were extremely painful.

A 26-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 19Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON) for contraceptive implant. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 29Dec2020. The patient reported a side effect from receiving the vaccine, lymph nodes on her arms got swollen to &#34;softball size&#34; since 19Jan2021 when she received the second dose of the vaccine and wants to know if this was normal. She understands that the arm was going to hurt, but she was noticing that her forearm hurts super bad and it a bit swollen, just on the side of the forearm its swollen, but under that arm her lymph nodes are swollen, she can barely pick up the arm and it just hurts on 20Jan2021. She noticed yesterday (19Jan2021), the lymph nodes were really tender, she would push it and it would hurt. Then when she got home from work, she lifted the arm to look at it, and she could see the swollen lymph nodes, the longer she kept the arm up, she could see the lymph nodes getting bigger. She wants to know how long this will last. She was talking to her mom and she was freaking out saying that people are dying from covid and the swollen lymph nodes, and that&#39;s why she has called today. She also stated that her left side swollen lymph nodes was worsened on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event swollen lymph nodes was not recovered, left forearm hurting and swelling and forearm hurts super bad was recovering while other events were unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after injection (about 7pm) I had some common symptoms. I began to develop a mild fever of 100.3, body aches, headache, swollen arm. These persisted throughout the night. I treated with Tylenol as recommended. I got a LOT of sleep and  fever and headache persisted until about noon the next day. By 4pm I was feeling good again except my lymph nodes under my left arm are swollen and are tender and painful.  I am treating the swollen lymph node pain with Tylenol. Over all the fever only lasted less than 24 hours with plenty of sleep.   It also is worth noting that my first dose I had zero side effects. These side effects from the second dose seem harmless enough and tolerable as they don&#39;t last long.

                                                I received my COVID19 vaccines on 12/31/2020 and 1/21/2021. On 2/3/2021 I woke up with pain, swelling, redness, and decreased range of motion in my R elbow at the site where I had hardware (wires, pins, tension band) placed during a surgical repair of my olecranon process in 2013. I have never had any issues with this elbow since the surgery, and no illnesses/dental work/medication changes in the months before this. The only change was getting my COVID vaccine. I went to see my PCP Dr. who advised me to go to the ER due to fear of a potential infection based on these symptoms. I went to the ER and after extensive testing they ruled out this being an infectious cause, though I was put on PO doxycycline as a precaution. An orthopedic specialist came to see me and determined that my body is essentially rejecting the hardware and I need to have surgery to have it removed. Since then, the swelling has decreased, however I still have persistent pain in my elbow along the site where the hardware is inserted and limited mobility due to pain with certain movements that put tension on this joint. I will need to have surgery eventually to have the hardware removed but am hoping to wait a couple months so that I can complete nursing school. I was advised to report any potential side effects from this vaccine and am choosing to do so as I do not know of any other reason this could be happening.

Also I had lower back pain, runny nose and I was nauseous . On the 3rd day I was feeling dizzy, nauseous, couldn&#39;t concentrate and an intense headache. Pills weren&#39;t helping at all

It is still hurting.; Tenderness; Feeling faint/Felt dizzy; Some trouble breathing; disoriented; Fatigue; Chills; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 28Jan2021 at 16:55 (reported as 4:55 PM) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was given at a vaccination clinic. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks and had no adverse events following prior vaccinations and that was why she thought she would be fine. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included anxiety, peanut allergy, tree nut allergy, and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

I had high blood pressure 180/120, facial puffiness and mild bottom lip swelling. I developed an onset of increased mucus in my throat causing me to clear my throat frequently. RN on site reported no throat swelling, but increased thickness due to mucus. I received a Benadryl injection on site within 30 minutes and almost immediately symptoms began to lessen. The next day I had mild bottom lip swelling, body itchiness, chest rash, headache and fatigue. Today (24 hours after vaccine) I have a headache, fatigue and body itchiness.

My arm hurt and was swollen the first time I got the covid shot but yesterday after the second shot it got really itchy and swollen. It is hard to lift my arm and started to worse throughout today. The injection site is a misshapen red rash that has spread. It started to leak a clearish pus liquid about an hour ago. I am recovering with a bandaid and adding antibiotics cream just in case. I will call my dr tomorrow if it continues to worsen.

                                                When I first got my shot I had a wave of heat go through me and then my throat and moth went dry. I waited my 15 minutes and get fine. 40 minutes after my shot I developed swollen face, lip, tongue and throat numbness and get like I couldn?t breathe. Then I went to ED. They gave me Benadryl and steroid and eventually sent home. Today 04/10/21 I woke up. Took my Benadryl and prednisone and about and hour after that my face has been extremely red, numb, and burning. It?s been 9 hours and I?m still having these symptoms. Called ED they said to stop the prednisone and only take Benadryl but my face is still really hot, red and burning.

I layed there for an hour not knowing what was going on, crying in pain because I literally never get fevers. It finally occurred to me at 2:30am that I was sick and asked my husband to get me a thermometer. He did and it was 100.6 degrees. I called out of work. My fever got higher and higher and I felt worse and worse. My fever got over 104 degrees when my fever reducers were wearing off. I had a fever for 2 days and my knees felt like they were broken, my husband had to physically carry me to the toilet because of my knee pain and weakness from the fever. I had no fever on Thursday, but I had the worst neck pain and migraine of my life for the next 3 days going from a sitting to standing position made me feel like my head was going to split into 2 and I verbally screamed a couple times from the head pain because it was such a searing pain that I have never experienced. My neck was so swollen and sore that I felt like I couldn&#39;t hold my head up.  I never feel like I fully recovered from getting sick. I have not experienced fatigue like this since I got mono when I was 19, I take 3-4 hour naps after work everyday because I barely have enough energy to stay up for my shifts let alone get through a whole day.  I am running shorter distances and slower miles and I can not run without napping first and my knees hurt when I walk/run/ and when on my feet at work. I have never experienced knee pain before I got sick from the vaccine and now it won&#39;t go away.

                                                About 2 days after my second dose of the vaccine I experienced painful/very uncomfortable swollen lymph nodes in the armpit area. This was especially on the left side, beside and below the armpit too, and extended to the breast area. It also occurred on the right side in the same areas, but not as severe. This lasted for about 1.5 weeks. It was uncomfortable to have arms at my side/move at all times. Soreness was present even when not moving or with arms up.

                                                Shot received at 7pm on the 23rd (Fri). I felt a little giddy, likely due to the emotional impact of excitement for treatment (this happened to me with my first shot, and both times with my partner). Experienced what I felt was like feeling mentally a little &#39;out of it&#39; a few hours in, maybe late that night 10-12pm. I did not have notable physical symptoms until exactly 12 hours after injection. Around 7-8AM I was woken up with body aches. I spent most of that day (Sat) taking ibuprofen and hydrating a lot. I had a small fever that peaked at 100.00 F after chills, etc, once this broke I mostly felt better. Sunday I had some minor aches. It is now Tuesday and here is the reason I am writing this report: I have had very low appetite since getting the shot, but I have pre-existing GI issues. This also happened on the first shot. Both times I have also had slight lymph swelling (mostly on first shot, and it was on the side of my body where injection was given, notably in the armpit, but possibly groin or shoulder). The only thing that has honestly caused me concern is my mental health: I have pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses and some extenuating circumstances (recent death in the family, needing to travel, job loss, pandemic, on top of major depression and PTSD) however I felt that my threshold for coping with day to day stuff has been blunted since getting the vaccine. It is manageable and I do think that it will go away as it did with the first shot. I felt like the last few days have been akin to &#34;PMSing&#34;, ie; irritable, crying a lot. Contextually, there are reasons for me to be having emotional fluctuations, but I have therapy and have been off/on medications safely and usually have this fairly under control. The reason it was bothering me is I felt that if this happened to other people who had less support or managed diagnoses or other circumstances, it could be worse for them. My partner (who is BP2) has also felt a little more emotionally unstable than usual. We do not think this is from the psychological toll solely of vaccination, the pandemic, or reopening, as it seems to be unrelated to this. Sure, this is anecdotal, but I think it may be important, especially in the event of someone who could have psychotic or mood swing issues (ie: BP1 or schizophrenia, etc). Again, anecdotal, but on some online forums a lot of people have reported having similar mood instability when theirs was otherwise manageable (and these were people who were pro-vax, pro-science, etc). I am worried that if there is not a warning in the future, more people could pre-emptively have mental health adverse effects and not know why. I think it is very seriously from the vaccine. For me this mostly included appetite issues, insomnia (especially the night after I got the shot), crying more, irritability, feeling kind of &#34;flat&#34;, etc. Perhaps this is just due to the body fighting and doing it&#39;s job. I felt however it would be irresponsible of me not to report it.  I have spoken with my mental health provider about this and do not find that I need further treatment but that I wanted them to know, and that I wanted to file a VAERS report additionally to help the study of the vaccine in case this happens to others.

                                                It started with back of knee pain that made it difficult for me to walk. I went to an urgent care on 4/12 and I was given a steroid for my leg inflammation. When the pain didn&#39;t subside two days later, I went to the ER and was admitted. It did not feel like I had muscle weakness. It felt like there were long rubber bands in my legs that felt tight and were about to snap. I also began to develop sensitivity to light touch (loose sweatpants moving against my legs while walking would cause pain up and down my legs). It has gotten easier to walk as time has gone on, and now instead of two large rubber bands feeling tight in my legs, it feels like there are many tiny, tight strings running up and down my legs.Sometimes if I walk too much or overextend my legs, these strings feel like they&#39;re on fire. Recently, my arms and different parts of my body have felt light burning intermittently throughout the day. My hands also felt like they were very hot yesterday (5/8) evening. When I looked at my hands, they looked a bit red/swollen with a tinge of blue/purple coloring. Fingers felt tender when typing, though I saw no sign of bruising. A few days ago, when I would hold up my phone to text, within a few seconds, my arms and hands felt like they were falling asleep. My right arm appeared to be worse that my left (it would fall asleep faster). The feeling in my arms would return when I would put my hands to my sides. This has never happened to me before. I have tried using my hands less and tried being more gentle with them. As a result, my arms and hands feel better after periods of rest/light use, but if I start using my arms/hands more regularly, the falling asleep sensation returns. I have also noticed more skin sensitivity as of late. I stopped wearing pants to prevent from feeling the leg pain I had mentioned earlier in this message. However, I was walking around the house yesterday (5/8) only wearing underwear, and I started to feel some light pain around the band of my underwear. I removed it and the pain went away. In addition, I normally wear loose t-shirts, but recently I had been experiencing a burning in my back/spine area. Once I removed my shirt, the burning sensation stopped. Wrists have also been feeling a bit stiff/achy as of late. Today (5/9) I was typing for about 30 to 45 minutes while working on this document. My fingertips felt tender, but I thought that I could use my hands for a bit without issue. I positioned myself so that my hands were below my body for constant blood supply. However, my right hand ring finger started to hurt and made it hard for me to type, so I have been resting on and off while working on this. It was a sharp string pain running along my finger. I checked both hands and they were red/swollen. Similar to this, on 5/2, I felt left middle finger pain that came and went over the span of a few days. I have not felt this left middle finger pain as of late. When I was in the ER (around 4/17), I felt left foot toe pain in the toe that&#39;s next to the pinky. The toe pain and finger pain were similar to each other in the sense that it was a sharp string pain. The working theory from the ER is that the vaccine might be causing flare ups for different ailments that I have had or am currently experiencing. I had injured the back of my left knee while in college, I had twisted the toe that started to feel pain while in the ER a few years back, I&#39;ve had hemorrhoids before, but they&#39;ve usually been painless and not noticeable. However, around the same time that it became harder for me to walk, my hemorrhoid pain became excruciating and now I have multiple hemorrhoids. I was tentatively diagnosed with potential reactive rheumatoid arthritis as a result of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The latest development in this string of occurrences is that as of this morning (5/16/2021), I&#39;ve had some brain fog that has lasted me the entire day. In addition, I have a dull, achy pain stemming from my right shoulder-blade to my right elbow that I&#39;ve been experiencing for a few hours now. My hearing has also been feeling more sensitive for this past week now. I noticed this starting from about 5/8. One of my friends was talking to me, and whenever she spoke, her voice sounded a bit fuzzy from my right ear and I could feel the vibrations in my right ear when she talked. The next day, my phone pinged, and similar to my experience with my friend, it sounded fuzzy in my right ear, plus I could feel my eardrum vibrating. Usually, I&#39;m quite hard of hearing and putting things on the highest volume isn&#39;t enough for me, but now, putting things at regular volume can seem a little too loud for me at times.

                                                Immediate numbness following injection. Later that evening ~7:00 p.m. joints and muscles in left arm/shoulder curled and seized-up. Tingling pins and needles with loss of sensation and dexterity. At bed time May 20th - continued pain, stiffness and swelling accompanied by high fever, chills, excessive sweating, and muscle convulsions. Intense ringing in ears. Next morning (May 21st) I had to miss work. Continued fever, chills, loss of appetite, mild nausea, nerve spasms and locked joints throughout entire body. I felt as though my body was poisoned. The weekend consisted of major fatigue and falling asleep during the day intermittently. Numb arms, weakened grip - could barely make a fist, and had a loss of coordination. Brain fog, delayed thoughts and physical responses. CONTINUED MUSCLE WEAKNESS AND NERVE SPASMS. I contacted doctor for help since my PCP&#39;s office was not open until Monday. I began taking Magnesium and B vitamins. I was drinking 1.5 gallons of water daily and still feeling thirsty. Called Doctor on the 24th to report involuntary muscle spasms in neck shoulders and lower back, joint stiffness, numbness, slowed circulation (pins and needles), and a vertigo-like falling sensation at bedtime. Cannot get to sleep comfortably without the spasms and my head rolling. He recommended Benadryl and Tylenol which I began taking which helped the numbness but not the shakiness and nerve spasms. He also offered a muscle relaxer, but I was concerned about waking up and driving to work in the early mornings so I declined since having trouble waking up with all the fatigue. It didn&#39;t matter anyway because since then I have missed work due to the sudden weakness, head fog, indigestion, and nerve tremors. Wednesday, I needed assistance going up and down stairs because my limbs felt limp like rubber bands. My joints are unusually cracking while my breathing is more labored. My resting heart rate was elevated and I could feel it beating harder than normal. Thursday, I drove myself to the E.R. because I feel as if I have aged 30 years in under a week. Their blood tests, EKG, and x-rays found nothing abnormal and I received fluids through an IV. However my nervous system feels absolutely shot. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. I WAS INCREDIBLY HEALTHY BEFORE THE SHOT. I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THESE RISKS. I LIVE A CLEAN, ACTIVE LIFESTYLE WITH REGULAR DIET AND EXERCISE. I HAVE NEVER NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARTICULATE MY BODY MOVEMENTS FLUIDLY AND PRECISELY. my doctor suspected I previously had an asymptomatic case of Covid, and that I had an allergic reaction directly related to the vaccine that attacked my nervous system. I FEEL SO MISERABLE AND WRONG. I worry about my quality of life from here on out even though I&#39;m told these symptoms will pass. Today, over a week post my first shot, I have loss of sensation in my arms, tingling in my extremities and base of skull, neck, and lower back (worse at night and when resting). My nerves are still randomly firing and I feel shaky. My body feels as if it has slowed down its automatic  functions.

A 27-year-old female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not reported) on 08Jan2021 14:00 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. There was no other relevant medical history. No unknown allergies. The patient previously received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EJ1685, expiry date not reported) on 19Dec2020 12:00 pm in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and experienced some arm pain which lasted several hours and mild. Concomitant medication included sertraline, ascorbic acid (VIT C), ergocalciferol (VIT D), zinc, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC). No other vaccine was received in four weeks. The patient had not had COVID prior vaccination, and COVID was not tested post vaccination.   After the second dose on 08Jan2021 at 02:00 pm, the patient had no symptoms until hour 12. On 09Jan2021 at 12:00 am she woke up middle of night to severe fatigue, myalgia, low grade fever, headache, swollen lymph node in left armpit (injected left arm). On 10Jan2020, the patient was 36 hours out and she still had these symptoms but slowly improving, relieved more with ibuprofen vs paracetamol (TYLENOL). She also reported she did not receive treatment for the events. She stated that the myalgia, fatigue, headache were severe and she almost had a syncopal episode from weakness.

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

Patient was monitored by staff from thereafter.  At 11:52am a second dose of 25mg diphenhydramine was given to patient due to possibly lip swelling reported by nurse. Patient denied shortness of breath or chest pain.  By 12:12pm marked lip and face swelling reported by nurse monitoring patient. Again patient denied shortness of breath/wheeze/chest pain. However, we advised patient that lip/face swelling is considered anaphylaxis and because symptoms were  progressing and not mitigated by diphenhydramine epinephrine would be advised. Epinephrine 0.3mg via auto injector pen was administered to patient on left outer thigh and 911 was called.  EMS arrived at 12:22pm and took patient to  local emergency department.

                                                I am 29 weeks pregnant with my first pregnancy and due April 22, 2021.   I woke up and felt a tender lump on the right side of my torso. It is 4 inches down from my ribs. It feels soft and hurts to touch.   I contacted my doctor and they said that if it continues to get worse then to come in and get it checked out but as of now - just wait and hopefully it will go down.

                                                Three days after both doses of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine, I experienced hand pain throughout the night that traveled up my forearms. On a scale from 1-10 the pain was about a 7.  After the first dose, the pain went away in the morning and I was fine. On the third day after the second dose, I woke up with a rash all over my body and again had pain throughout the night only this time I woke up with swollen hands. It?s now been two weeks since my second dose and I am still experiencing hand pain, though improving. My hands feel sore and tight.

I also noticed at about 30 hours when I was showering that I had swollen lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my left armpit when I raised my arm above my head. Now, 45 hours later I feel more like myself but the sore arm and swollen lymph nodes still persist.

                                                Less than 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I experienced tingling in my left fingers. Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

My partner thought I was dying as it was much more intense and extreme then normal. I am still having increased seizures in both pain and severity daily. Typically my seizures last 20 minutes and are from 4-5 in discomfort in pain out of ten. Now they are around 7, even a week later. The first severe seizure was a 10 level pain and diabling.   I also got severe swelling in my arm of the site, extreme pain in the my arm lasting four days, and two large cold sores. Typically my cold sores small and last for two days. Mine are still active and gave me a fat lip. I also have extreme fatigue but could be caused by the increased seizures and pain of them.   I been unable to perform my normal duties and responsibilities, which my seizures typically do not interfere with.

After examining the site of the lump, it appeared to be swollen when compared to my collarbone on the right side.  The lump on the left side is the same side I received the injection.  After researching, it appears that the tender lump may be a swollen lymph node(s) near my collar bone related to the Pfizer vaccine.  It has now been present for 5 days, but appears to be reducing in size and sensitivity as time goes on.  I have contacted my primary care provider who has instructed me to monitor the lump and follow up in person after a few weeks if it has not subsided.

Originally it was pea-sized, then the next day tripled in size and became red, hot, and very tender. Over the next week it reduced in size until it healed. Over the two days after the vaccine, I was very tired and my arm where I received the vaccine was very sore and bruised. The bruise and soreness lasted about 1.5 weeks.

                                                Woke with up chest, arm and jaw pain on 03/21/2021. Presented to the ED. Her initial EKG was negative for any acute changes but her troponin was elevated. Cardiology was consulted. Her echo was negative for cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. But after her troponin continued to rise she was taken to the cath lab to look for ischemia. Her cardiac angiography was negative for obstructive disease, and coronary arteries were completely normal. Had low magnesium and potassium- so started on oral supplementation. Discharged on 03/22/2021 with nitroglycerin (which was not helpful and made her feel worse/nauseated) and to follow up with outpatient cardiac MRI and cardiology. This imaging revealed significant myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis.   04/01/2021 Per Cardiology: -Given that the patient had covid 19 back in November 2019 I believe she may have had a low yield subacute myocardial infection at that time that was somehow exacerbated by her 1st covid vaccine. Therefore, after some consideration and careful discussion I am advising against the 2nd vaccine at this time.  -No physical exercise for 6 months given her current myocarditis and family hx of sudden cardiac death -May trial PRN NSAIDS for pain relief -Recommend birth control and no pregnancy until at least after her follow up cMRI  -Follow up in 6 months with cMRI prior

Thereafter had lacy rash over entire body for 3 days which she took as needed benadryl with improvement. After her second dose on 5/10/21 she initially had no symptoms. Approximately 6-7 days after her second dose lacy whole-body rash returned, worse than when she initially had it after first vaccine dose. She took benadryl several times but rash worsened. She had an odd sensation in her throat and noticed a change in the tone of her voice, and felt like she was having difficulty breathing. She presented to the emergency department.

The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

                                                I noticed on January 12 that my left arm where I received the shot my bones were aching and my joints (my shoulder, my elbow, my forearm bones, and all my hand joints) were aching and my hand was slightly swollen. My coworker reported aching joints two days after she received the vaccine. So I?m not sure if my aching joints are related to the vaccine but I?m suspicious they are.

                                                I got the COVID Pfizer vaccine and experienced warmth in my chest with the first vaccine. It went away after one day and was tolerable. I also developed a lump under my right armpit with the first dose that slowly went away. It was painful, but the pain was tolerable. With the second vaccine, I also got the chest warmth and chest pressure for 2 days. I did not seek help as it was also tolerable. I also developed the lump under my armpit with the 2nd dose, this time I still have it and it is more painful and bigger. I have been taking naproxen for the pain.

Took Benadryl 50mg before bedtime.  2 days after vaccine: woke up with voice changes, coughing/choking with speaking. Used epipen once, felt full relief for about 1-2 hours. Trouble speaking again. Then went to ER, had epipen again twice, over two hours, Benadryl 50IV and Pepcid and steroids. Sitting in the ER now debating admission. Likely being admitted., home epipen are too expensive to treat q2h by myself.

Woke that night with tachycardia to 220&#39;s.  Tachycardia of varying degree and severe diaphoresis was constant through the next 72 hours.  Did not seek care. Since then, for 3 weeks she has had multiple runs of SVT.  Last one was Saturday 1/9 - went to ER, episode recorded.  Given rx of xanax which did not resolve her tachycardia.  Established care with me 1/14/2021 and noted to have 3/6 systolic murmur.  Patient (who is a PA) states it is significantly louder than it was prior to vaccination.

                                                My arm started to hurt , tingled and then turned into feeling very heavy as soon as injection was admitted. I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number requested) in the hospital via intramuscular route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose on the right deltoid for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  The patient medical history was not reported and there were no concomitant medications. The patient was previously administered a flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced sore arm. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was reported that the patient developed supraclavicular lymphnode swelling on 11Jan2021 and was calling to see if this is normal or if it was something others have experienced. She noticed that last week or about 5 days (also reported as 11Jan2021) after receiving the vaccine her supraclavicular lymph node was swollen.  She stated that it was just that one lymph node on the same side that she received the injection. She added that the lymph node is not as painful, but is still tender and is mobile. She said that it is tender if she pushes on it. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

                                                Left neck palpable, mobile, approx 8-10 mm in diameter, lymphadenopathy of anterior chain/supraclavicular noted 8 days after first vaccine that gradually decreased in size over the following two weeks to approximately pea sized. Lymph nodes became enlarged again to 8-10 mm in diameter the day following 2nd vaccine dose and again gradually decreased in size and still around pea sized currently. Made future appointment with my PCP after initial symptoms, was scheduled 1.5 weeks out for 1/22/2021. Contacted my work and PCP prior to appointment on 1/20/2021 to discuss improving symptoms, was reassured that as size of lymph nodes were decreasing, no further lab/diagnostic testing needed at that time so 1/22/2021 visit was canceled since I was about to receive the 2nd dose on 1/23/2021 so symptom monitoring was recommended. Was seen by my PCP for annual physical 2/10/2021 where lymph nodes were palpable, small in size. Continued monitoring was recommended at that time.

Around 8:00pm the next day, 3/16/2021, I began to notice swollen lymph nodes under armpits. Upon waking up Wednesday morning, 3/17/2021 @ 8:00 AM, I had multiple severely swollen lymph nodes under both armpits note that my right armpit has been constantly more severe, Id began to get a mild sore throat and throughout the day I gained a cough. My swollen lymph nodes continued to get worse until Saturday 3/20, at which point they began to subside. As of today, 3/22/21 @ 11:20 AM, I currently still have 2 small swollen lymph nodes under my right armpit, as well as a sore throat, which seems to be getting worse with time.

I started to have a reaction to it and was instructed by the physician on site to use my epi pen. Symptoms resolved within 5-10 minutes of using my epi pen. The on site MD called EMS and I was transported to ED for obs. I was discharged shortly thereafter. I have a hx of anaphylaxis both idiopathic and to iron dextran and basil.

                                                Waited for the 15 minute observation period and felt fine, but while driving home (approximately 20 minutes after injection) I caught a glimpse of my face in the rearview mirror and noticed that it was swollen, specifically in the cheeks and under eye regions. When I got home 5 minutes later, it was more swollen and my throat was feeling tight, though not obstructing my breathing. I monitored the reaction and did not take any medications. About 30 minutes after the reaction began (50 minutes after injection), the facial swelling began to diminish and both the facial swelling and throat swelling went away within about an hour from the onset of the reaction, I was very tired and had a headache the rest of the day, which I understood to be more typical symptoms.

I am breastfeeding, so I thought it was a clogged duct or mastitis but it cleared on its own in 3 days. 3 days after my second dose of the vaccine I got severe swelling, redness, and pain in my left breast. The swelling and redness are so severe my Arreola has almost doubled in size. The pain is still very bad after 3 days and has not subsided yet

After the first week, I developed knee pain, a cough, and extreme fatigue. I had to miss a day of work on Monday, April 12th due to my symptoms. I slept for 48 hours (Sunday, April 11th 9pm-Tuesday, April 13th 9am) due to my extreme fatigue.

                                                On about April 8th, 2021 I began to experience a sharp stabbing pain in my lower left shoulder blade that would throb persistently. My upper back and my left underarm area on my torso towards my back began to hurt and become extremely sensitive to touch. My lymph nodes in my left armpit, left collarbone, and on the left side of my neck were and still are very swollen. I initially went to the doctor on April 14th, 2021 after dealing with this pain that was getting progressively worse. I feared that I was having a pulmonary embolism or a cardiac event, and maybe even a problem with my spleen. After examination, my doctor believed the culprit to be my inflamed lymph nodes causing inflammation in the surrounding areas. My doctor sent me home with Meloxicam and Flexeril to help with my pain. On the night of April 14th, 2021 I noticed a rash under my left breast beginning to form. Over the course of the next 3 days, the rash became a cluster of blisters, I developed severe shooting pains from my left breast into my under arm area and around my back along the left side. My spine in my upper back began to feel bruised, along with my sternum which feels bruised and inflamed internally. I&#39;ve been so uncomfortable that I&#39;ve been having trouble sleeping. The pain also worsens after I eat, which makes eating really difficult. I made a second doctor&#39;s appointment for today, April 17th, 2021 (I was unable to get a sooner appointment) . My doctor confirmed that the rash is in fact Shingles and she prescribed me Valtrex and Percocet for the pain. I am currently taking these medications. Because I just found out my diagnosis today, I am still in severe pain and it&#39;s been 14 days since my second Pfizer vaccine. I do not have any known autoimmune disorders.

                                                I started off with typical symptoms: swollen lymph node (right armpit), migraine, chills, body aches/ joint aches in knees and legs and a fever. I had taken Tylenol extra strength every 4-6 hours which seemed to help. A day and a half after my second vaccine (4/23 2:00 AM), I started having diarrhea and vomiting (intensely). I had two vasovagal syncope episodes, each about 30 min from each other, I am not sure how long I was unconscious either time. It is 4/23 today at 12:14 PM and I am still not able to stand without fainting or vomiting. My fever is gone now, but I am still having hot flashes/ chills/ body aches/ nausea.

Swelling of face (lips, eyelids), neck area. Tingling of lips. Events started about 24 hours after 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. Differential: allergic reaction vs. reaction to vaccine vs. AED related hypersensitivity/rash vs. much less likely SJS. Dermatology consulted. Patient reports gardening on 4/18 and near weed whacking activities in an area that has poison ivy. Patient reports extreme sensitivity to poison ivy historically. Rash biopsy: differential diagnosis includes drug reaction and allergic/irritant contact dermatitis. Presence of a couple days of treatment may hinder histologic features for diagnosis.

                                                12 hours after first dose, had extremely painful and swollen R lymph cervical node and fatigue. Continued for three days. On 12/25 awoke with painful gums, fevers of 102.1, chills in addition to symptoms. 12/26 had sore throat and worsening sores on tongue. Went to urgent care that morning, was tested for Covid, strep, influenza, RSV. All negative. Had overwhelming fatigue. 12/27 worsening tongue sores and thrush, had another appointment where given nystatin. At this appointment was diagnosed with an immune over response to the COVID-19 vaccine. The thrush still was not improving and extremely painful. Was started on Fluconazole for 14 days after another appointment on 12/29. No history of thrush, have good oral hygiene and follow all recommendations to prevent thrush with my inhaler. I lost 12 pounds due to the thrush and the extreme discomfort. Fever went away 8 days after vaccine dose, still have lingering thrush symptoms and R lymph node slightly enlarged.

The next morning I also had a sore left deltoid, and soreness extending into my left chest and shoulder, which diminished throughout the day after ibuprofen and tylenol. I also had a left swollen armpit, which I interpreted as swollen lymph nodes. My left armpit was sore and was visibly swollen compared to the right. The left lymph node is still visibly swollen as I report this (approximatley 36 hours after vaccine administration), and is sore but less sore than initially.   Of note, when I received the first vaccine in this series, my left deltoid was more sore than with the second administration, but soreness was limited to the deltoid and resolved within 3 days.

Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EL1284/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration in the right arm, on 30-DEC-2020 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 29 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Relevant medical history was none. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On an unknown date, the patient experienced right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy - five freely mobile lymph nodes, tender to palpation, roughly 1 cm in size. The patient did not receive treatment for the event right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The outcome of the event right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was not recovered. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Since I have extensive family history of brear cancer and lymphoma I got lab work and a CT scan with contrast of my chest and neck.  Labwork (cbc, cmp, ana, crp) was normal. Peripheral smear showed increased in Roloux phenomenon. CT showed unilateral generalized lymphadenopathy on axillary, infraclavicular, supraclavicular and cervical region. With some noted measuring &gt; 1cm.

Concomitant medication included valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) from 2009 and ongoing for cold sores, ongoing fluticasone propionate (FLONASE ALLERGY RELIEF), ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (BLISOVI FE 1/20) from 2006 and ongoing for birth control. The patient previously received first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899) on 15Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fever and body aches. The reporter wanted to verify if it was an interaction. She didn&#39;t feel like it was a drug interaction. She was questioning if there could be a drug interaction. She took Valtrex for cold sores on her face. She received her second dose of the COVID vaccine yesterday on 06Jan2021. Today 07Jan2021, she got a cold sore this morning and took Valtrex. She was wondering if the Valtrex, being an antiviral, could affect the vaccine in any way. She got the cold sores randomly anyway. They come on because of stress. She has a history with them. Caller didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine through work. This time for second dose she developed body aches only. She received the vaccine yesterday 06Jan2021, and developed body aches today 07Jan2021. They have worsened as the day went on, but she was at work. Since she was home now and not moving around as much they weren&#39;t as bad. She got the vaccine because she worked in a nursing home. She was an essential worker who was at high risk. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

                                                Morning of 14th, I woke up and my left arm hurt to move - it wasn&#39;t the site itself, it was under my armpit (where the lymph node is).  I didn&#39;t call my doctor at that point because I read that it was a side effect. Dull/always there pain at that point. On the 15th, shooting pains - this lasted two days. It started getting better again by the 17th. It was resolved by the 18th.  14-17th - Swelling that I could feel and see and that also went back to normal by the 18th. It was just tender to touch for a little while after that....after it didn&#39;t hurt to move I didn&#39;t pay as much attention to it. I was able to go to work but I had to modify what I could do at work. I could not do my normal swimming exercise until that next week.

                                                When I got up Monday morning, I noticed I had a enlarge lymph node, in the same arm where the vaccine was given.  It was the size of a tennis ball. I went to the Doctor, she did a chest xray and blood work to rule out lymphoma. That came back negative and I have had some shortness of breath.  This hasn&#39;t went away, has got smaller but still there, My PCP is keeping an eye on it.

                                                swollen lymph nodes around collarbone and neck; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (patient). A 29-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EL3246 and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), probiotics (PROBIOTICS) and multivitamin. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced swollen lymph nodes around collarbone and neck on 20Jan2021. No treatment was administered for the event. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab: negative on 04Jan2021. The event had not resolved. The event required a physician office visit.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.

From my neck, to my armpit, to my low back and in my groin, i have swelling in spots up and down my left side. I had a fever starting 24hr after the injection. This lasted until today and was treated with OTC IBUPROFEN. The ibuprofen has had no effect on the swelling or pain in nodes. Aches, chills, and joint pain are other secondary complaints/effects with more milder level of pain.  It?s been 3 days since injection and the swelling in my lymph nodes does not seem to be getting better.

This progressed to the lymph nodes around my chest and neck, and I developed a lump of swollen lymph nodes on the back of my neck about 48 hours after my shot that lasted about a day. My lymph nodes in my chest arm and underarm stayed swollen for about a week.   About 48 hours after my shot, I began experience minor muscle spasms in my right foot, then in the arm muscle where I was injected. Throughout that day and the next week, I experienced minor muscle spasms throughout my entire body. They were  most prominent on my left side of my body where I got the injection. I also felt weakness and tingling in my left arm for about a week. The muscle spasms throughout my body and weakness in my left arm continued slowly subsided over about 3 weeks after my shot. They were minor spasms, but were persistent across the three weeks.

On 3/6/21 I started experiencing  slight pain in my axillary region. Pain was probably 3 of 10. Stayed at this pain level until 3/8, when it started to increase and to date pain is increasing and there is a large lump in my under my arm. Lifting my arm above my shoulder increases pain. Pain also wraps around to my shoulder area. I have never had any pain in or around this region until after the vaccine.

The left side of my face was not affected and there was no respiratory involvement. In the following few hours, my right eye had transient pain and my cheek felt swollen. The next day, I had chills, arm soreness, mild headache at times, and while my facial symptoms were still present, they had improved. The second day I only had mild numbness and tingling on my face with some lip tingling. Day three, four, and five I had slight numbness of the right side of my face and tingling lips, no further symptoms. As of day 6, I have slight eye pressure around my right eye and mild lip tingling.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

Over the course of the week my thumb got more and more swollen and harder to move. Very hard to bend, and started to throb when it rained. I would best describe it as arthritis. My left thumb is twice the size of my other thumb. Swelling goes down in the afternoon and is worse in the morning. I didn?t previously have any kind of injury to my left thumb.

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

I was taken to the Hospital Emergency Room to be evaluated. There they did a full exam, Blood work, and EKG, and chest x ray. Blood work revealed I had an extremely elevated D-Dimer so I was transferred by ambulance to Hospital for further evaluation. Once there I had a CT scan which showed enlarged lymph nodes but no other conclusions, I was released and told to follow up with a  Cardiologist and Pulmonologist for further evaluation of my symptoms.

This 29-year-old (at the time of vaccination) female nurse (patient) reported for that she received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number; unknown, unable to locate or read the details intramuscular on 08Jan2021 at 06:30 pm at single dose on right leg for covid-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Patient&#39;s medical history was not reported (Known allergies: None). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot; unknown, intramuscular on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am at single dose on right leg for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccine facility was reported as hospital. Concomitant medications in two weeks) included metformin, levothyroxine, loratadine (CLARITINE). If other vaccine in four weeks; no. Nurse reported that At 2 weeks post first vaccine, on 30Jan2021 at 08:00 pm I experienced heart burn for about a week. Not a huge deal. At 3 weeks post the second vaccine, I have severe armpit pain. My lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally in both arms despite receiving doses in same arm. It feels like a constant burning as if someone injected icy hot into my armpit with a needle. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was given for the adverse events. AE treatment: Went to my PCP where additional labs were drawn CBC, CMP, covid antibodies, and covid test with unknown results. Patient did not have covid prior vaccination. Covid test done post vaccination on 09Feb2021 included nasal swab and test resulted as negative. The outcome of events was recovering.

Started exactly 24hours after shot and lasted 4 days. On the 2nd day of the symptoms is when my face and tongue became swollen and my throat felt like there was an arm around it.

Severe jaw pain starting 48 hours after vaccination (approx 12 pm 4/13) on right side of jaw, constant and intense, not limiting ability to move but preventing focus on tasks. Mild pain in some lymph nodes, mild headache, moderate fatigue not inconsistent with having been recently ill. All symptoms dealt with by patient without seeking medical intervention. OTC anti-nausea was taken without relief.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                48 hours after the vaccine my mouth began itching after eating. It happened during breakfast and lunch this day, and then the next morning at breakfast, which is when I became worried. My throat began feeling tight, felt like it had mucus in it and I needed to clear it. My mouth was itching and my tongue felt tingly. Four days after the vaccine my tongue started to swell so I called my doctor.   I saw him the Tuesday, 3/2 after the vaccine and he said my thyroid was swollen and felt I was having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He did an allergy panel and lab work for my thyroid, all tests came back within normal limits. He referred me to an allergist and said to take benadryl every six hours. A few days later my  bottom lip started to swell and my tongue ached. I was also having intermittent chest pains for about five weeks. Then my lymph nodes in my throat started throbbing.   I saw the allergist on 4/6 and he advised to cancel the second dose. He did lab work to check for autoimmune disorders and inflammation but tests came back normal. He advised on 4/19 to take allegra two times a day for three weeks and we will follow up.   Ongoing symptoms are mouth itching after eating, tingling in throat, and itching on throat and neck, and on and off swelling of my bottom lip. I have also experienced lightheadedness and ocular migraines.

Prevented me from sleeping for more than 2-3 hours at a time for 3-4 days. Also prevented me from resting my arm at my side comfortably for 3-4 days. Today (4/23/2021) the lymph node is still enlarged, closer to the size of a grape.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 30Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The reporter is not related to a study or program. Concomitant medications included unspecified medication (She does take other medications but does not know the significance). On 30Mar2021, the physician stated that, the patient developed immediate right-side neck pressure, skin and jaw tingling, and swollen lymph nodes. She did not have any trouble breathing and did not have any hives. These events were considered as medically significant. The pharmacist gave her 2 Benadryl and she stayed there for an hour. She said she does not think the Benadryl did anything for her. The physician stated that the patient went home and slept off the immediate reaction she experienced and had fatigue for 3 days. The patient had fatigue for 3 days and no other problems. The physician inquired on advisable information for the second dose. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported serious events cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Blood pressure was fine and ultrasound showed that baby was okay. They treated me with fluids and sent me home a few hours later. Don&#39;t know if it was vaccine related - doctor thought it was dehydration and/or pregnancy hormones.

About one hour after second dose of Pfizer vaccine, she developed a progressive headache that ultimately led to Urgent care visit that evening. Discharged but then returned to ER overnight due to worsened headache. HCT negative.  headache continued next four days.  4/23/21 developed diplopia. 4/25 returned to ER due to this and increase in headache. Findings of papilledema, HCT again negative. Lab work with mild leukocytosis ~13 and thrombocytosis ~490. LP opening pressure &gt;55mm H2O with diagnosis of Intracranial Hypertension. Acetazolamide started.  Neurology consult 4/28/21 showing R eye abducens palsy. MRI/MRV with contrast  4/29/21 shows severely narrowed transverse sinuses but NO evidence for venous sinus thrombosis. Currently awaiting catheter venography to confirm this with consideration of further management.  Adverse event appears to be potential acute exacerbation of Intracranial hypertension related to possible baseline anatomic narrowing of transverse venous sinuses. currently further evaluation to try and absolutely rule out acute venous sinus thrombosis though no evidence of this on MRVenogram with gadolinium contrast.

Clinical course: the patient was asking for advice because she had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine 1 week ago and had a really bad reaction and had to go to the hospital. It has been a week now and the symptoms are continuously getting worse. It sounds like the side effects were all expected. She felt like she had the flu yesterday. She is really achy, her lymph nodes in her underarm area are really swollen, and it hurts to move her arm. She is familiar that these symptoms are expected, but it has been a week. She wants to know if she should see a physician or if there is something she should do. Event details: The flu like feeling was not until 6 days after she got the first shot. It is not as bad but she does have aches and congestion. Her lymph nodes are really swollen and she has a headache and tiredness. She had symptoms before, that was just the start of the flu like feeling. On the day of the shot she went to the hospital because she completely lost her vision and had chest pain. She got the shot on Monday, 12Apr2021. She had numbness in her face, vision loss, and chest pain. From there she went to the hospital and that subsided. It was just like total exhaustion and body aches for the next couple of days. She lost her vision for 5 minutes total. The numbness to her face was right after the shot and is all gone now. The achiness is pretty bad now. It differs per day but her symptoms have probably gotten a little worse as time has gone on. She had slight pain in her lymph nodes and they weren&#39;t really swollen. It got progressively worse to now they are very swollen and it hurts to move her arm. It was the same arm where the shot was given. The headache is off and on. It started around Thursday 15Apr2021. It is sporadic when she gets it. It hasn&#39;t gone away. The tiredness has been the same since she got the shot. When she went to the hospital she went to the ER. She was not admitted. She spent 4 to 5 hours there. Treatment: In the ER she just had an IV (intravenous). Other than that they did a bunch of lab work. She had no medicine or anything. Investigations: They did a chest X-ray and lab work in the ER. Emergency Room Visit required for events completely lost her vision, chest pain, numbness in her face, felt like she had the flu.

It&#39;s been almost 5 weeks now and I still have a low grade fever, consistently around 99.8 - 100.8. Today as of the time of this writing (5/27/21) my temp is 101.4. My normal/baseline temperature historically is around 98.5. Along with this consistent fever, I&#39;m now experiencing random muscle spasms and nerve pain throughout my body, something I have never experienced before. This started 2 weeks ago with back pain that turned into roaming muscle/nerve spasms. Last week I started having abdominal pain that lasted for 3 days. Yesterday, the injection site on my right arm started throbbing and continued throbbing until this morning.   I&#39;ve seen a doctor and am having some tests done, but largely this remains a mystery. Before the 2nd shot I was fine, no fever, no muscle/nerve pain, and wasn&#39;t nearly as fatigued as I am now.

                                                Patient was found unresponsive at home on 5/22, admitted to another institution, found to be in DKA, multisystem organ failure (renal failure, liver failure), new R femoral DVT, elevation of ferritin, LDH and CRP.  Over the course, platelet count continues to drop while on anticoagulation, and continued progression of thrombi, and transferred to our institution for further workup, including hepatic failure, concern for HLH and Castro trophic antiphospholipid syndrome.  Based on chart review, patient had non-specific symptoms for a few weeks prior to the presentation, including GI distress, dysphagia and neck/sinus pain.  CTH done with cerebral edema but not intracranial venous thrombosis.  CT chest and abdomen with no PE, but presence of R popliteal vein thrombus, and portal vein thrombus.  Heparin Ab (PF4 -ELISA test) was negative (at both referring  hospital and current hospital).  Serotonin release assay is pending at the time of report.  While the symptoms are not consistent VITT that were reported (Heparin ab negative, received mRNA vaccines), however this possibility cannot be ruled out.  IVIG was started on 5/27 - 5/28 to treat empirically for concern for heparin induced thrombocytopenia vs VITT.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and other healthcare professional. A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0153), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27May2021 11:00 (at the age of 29 years old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. There was no patient history and no family medical history relevant to adverse event.  Reported to be no other products and no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No Adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient wanted to know if she was considered fully vaccinated after receiving just 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. The patient stated that she worked in health care around people and she got the vaccine to protect herself and others. The patient reported that she had a reaction after the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine on Thursday, 27May2021. She said her face became swollen, she broke out in hives, and had itchiness. The patient stated that her face began to swell 2 or 3 hours after she had vaccine and stated that she was taking Benadryl like candy and the reactions went away on Friday afternoon for good. The patient also reported that swelling, itching and hives also happened at the same time after the vaccine and went away on Friday afternoon. The adverse event did not require a visit to emergency room/physician office and the patient was not hospitalized. The patient stated that she had an EpiPen at home and Benadryl. If it got too bad, she would have taken her EpiPen and gone to the emergency room. She said her doctor told her not to get the 2nd dose. She asked if that would put her as not fully vaccinated. She was trying to figure out how that would work. Should she try another company like Johnson and Johnson even though they are not supposed to be mixed, or was she considered exempt. The patient wanted to know if she should try to get a vaccine from a different company like Johnson &amp; Johnson, and how it would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine that she previously had. It was reported that, there were no relevant tests and no investigation assessments done. The clinical outcome of the events her face became swollen, hives, itchiness was recovered on 28May2021 and event if she should try to get a vaccine from a different company like Johnson &amp; Johnson was unknown.

Not much longer and the hives/itching spread down my back and chest. Face became swollen. Benadryl cream was initially attempted, but only briefly subsided the itching and reaction continued spreading. I took oral quick release Benadryl and was able to prevent the reaction from continuing. I had to take a secondary Benadryl dose a few hours later and extreme joint pain accompanied the allergic reaction.

                                                For 2 days after the vaccinations, my left deltoid/ upper arm was sore. Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

At that point, I started to get very dizzy and lightheaded. Every time I opened my eyes, everything was spinning. This lasted four about 3-4 hours. I kept breaking out into sweats. I had a horrible headache for about 4 days straight. I am still continuing to having headaches. I am still having hot flashes and dizziness episodes at times that go away after about a few minutes. Two days ago, I stated to developing swelling in my hands with achy joints which has not gone away.

                                                periorbital edema, lip swelling Narrative: ED note: This is a 29 year old employee who got her COVID vaccine yesterday. This morning she noticed facial puffiness, mostly around her eyes. No swelling of lips, toungue, no trouble swallowing or speaking, no swelling of throat, no SOB, no n/v or dizziness. Here she had some mild periorbital puffiness that I would not be aware of if she did not point it out to me. There is no swelling of her lips, airway and no SOB or problems with her voice. Her symptoms are improving in the ER. I think it is unlikely that this delayed symptom is related to the vaccine, however, she also states she had some swelling of the right side of her lip yesterday (none today), so I&#39;m going to prescribe her an epi-pen.

                                                Incredible arm/shoulder/lymph node pain starting 10 hours post-vaccination lasting about 60 hours. About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two &#34;attacks&#34;.  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of &#34;foggy&#34; 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these &#34;attacks&#34;, not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours. It is currently about 70 hours post-vaccination and most symptoms except moderate arm soreness are gone. During both attacks, BP and temperature were normal, heart rate slightly elevated (80-85 bpm).  Other non-severe effects included fatigue,  slight chills/flush.

I was so tired and sleepy I slept almost all day for the first 48 hrs after. Developed fever between 100.5-101 which lasted about 18hrs which did require me to have to call into work the following day.  2/3 I developed swelling and pain in the lymph nodes under my right arm and breast.  The swelling subsided within 4days but I still have some tenderness to date.  I took tylenol and ibuprophen for the first 48 hours to help with all the symptoms.

My face felt &#34;buzzy&#34; but didn&#39;t swell and I did not have significant itching. I have had similar reactions in the past to cleaning products and pesticides and usually take a benadryl, though I do carry an epipen and had one with me at the time. Instead of going back in the convention center for medical attention I took a benadryl and waited in the parking garage for about an hour and felt the throat restriction ease a bit. About 10 hours later around 8pm the tightness came back suddenly over about 10 minutes and I took another benadryl. The next morning around 7am I had one more round of tightening and took one more benadryl, and it stopped after that. I told my doctor about it a few days later.

I took a picture of it and contacted my OBGYN who thought since it was on the side my vaccine was given (left arm) and appeared one day after vaccination that it was likely due to the vaccine and to keep an eye on it, she was not concerned. I kept track of it for several days and the size started to decrease over the next 2-3 weeks approximately. It is now essentially gone. There may be very very small swelling noted if I side bend my head to the right to make the lymph node on the left side of my neck pop out but it is extremely mild. I?ve had no pain or issue in the area. At the time of the vaccine I was 21 weeks pregnant. My due date is approaching.

Within 12 hours, the itching got much worse and my three toes started to swell. The itch was bad enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep, but I wouldn&#39;t say there was much pain. I noticed a cut in between a couple of my toes and a small blister. I thought it was Athlete&#39;s foot until a colleague told me about COVID toes. I&#39;ve been taking Benadyrl and using athlete&#39;s foot products (Lotrimin) that have been helping with the itch. Going on day 5 with some reduction in swelling.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness.

My arm was extremely sore for more than a week. I could barely fully extend my entire arm and I developed a lump in the pit of my arm pit. Both my tricep and  bicep mussels were tender. I also experienced headaches and tinnitus. The soreness of my arm and lump have gone away however I still have headaches and tinnitus to this day.

Was in severe pain in neck with difficulty swallowing.  Went to urgent care and was given muscle relaxers. Pain continued for 3 weeks after, severe still. Began chiropractor visits, no improvement. Had MRI completed, showed golf ball sized lymph node swelling in neck on side of severe pain. Went to ENT for course of steroids with mild improvement. Still having mild to moderate neck pain everyday and it has been 2 months since vaccine. Would never get this type of vaccine again, and I am a medical professional who usually trusts them.

No other symptoms, just swelling of face to include lips, eyes, cheeks. \I went to the ER that Thursday.  Friday I saw the allergist via telehealth. Didn&#39;t know if due to vaccine. Benadryl was not helping. Dr. put me on oral steroids for 7 day taper. It cleared up the swelling.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I experienced severe pain from my shoulder and part of back on left side all the way down my arm to my hand and fingers on left side. Injection was in the left arm. Within the next day, my hand started swelling. I kept waking up from pain due to back, arm, and hand. I got a fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea but all of those subsided within the span of 3 days, the only thing that didn&#39;t subside was the pain in my arm and swelling in my hand. I&#39;ve been taking two aleve twice a day and icing my hand and arm. Pain has improved but left hand is still swollen even after 8 days since injection. I haven&#39;t been able to drive or use my hand regularly.

                                                7 days after first vaccine I started feeling like I pulled a muscle in my right bicep (shot was in right arm) I waited a few days and the pain got worse and spread to my forearm. It was extremely painful and swollen. I could not straighten my arm. Where the pain was in my forearm red blotchiness appeared and got bigger over a day. I did have an endoscopy the day before and had and IV in for a short time.   I don&#39;t want this to be disregarded be both Birth control and having an IV can contribute to blood clots, I think it needs to be warned before getting the vaccine that those things can increase the risk of blood clots. So just avoid IVs around the time of the vaccine and maybe pause Birth Control.

The following week, additional spots appeared and faded from stomach, hips, inner thighs, under arms, right knee, and side of neck. Currently, I have new hives developing on my inner forearm (right) and wrist (left), waistline, hips, back and side of neck. A lymph node at the back of my neck/base of skull is swollen (I have not noticed any other swelling of the lymph nodes themselves, just the skin over top). I have continued taking an antihistamine allergy pill for relief, topical itch cream (Benadryl) has not been noticeably effective.

This was controlled 3 hours later by tylenol. For the next 36 hours post symptom onset my sinuses were still affected, my muscles felt very weak and the glands in my neck felt swollen. Everything has resolved except the swollen glands in my neck and my sinsuses being dry and painful.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

I also started to have some swelling in my throat by 4 days after the second dose and ended up going to immediate care for a steroid injection which began to provide relief by the next morning.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiration date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included testing positive for COVID in Apr2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced soreness. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient called in regards to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She received her first vaccine last Thursday, 07Jan2021. She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. She didn&#39;t expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn&#39;t have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it&#39;s not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn&#39;t have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy. She doesn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or anything. It&#39;s not a major reaction, just a little bit of a rash/itchiness in her chest and neck area.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

                                                I am reporting my symptoms through this avenue because the VAERS wouldn&#39;t let me complete my daily report on that day (no submit button found).  I had malaise a few hours after the shot. 12 hours after the shot, this turned into a fever that would peak at 103 within the next 12 hours. Fever was accompanied by severe chills, moderate headache, moderate muscle aches, mild joint aches, and mild nausea. I also had a swollen lymph node under my armpit ipsilateral to the injection, the diameter of a baseball. Discomfort from the lymph node was mild. The fever and chills were so bad that I couldn&#39;t do any daily activities and stayed in bed all day. I called a nurses line to ask them if I could take something for the discomfort and they advised Tylenol, so I took 1000 mg. Tylenol did bring down the fever to 101 and the fever rose back to 103, 9 hours after Tylenol. All the aforementioned symptoms lasted for 3 days, and the severe symptoms decreased in severity to &#34;moderate&#34; after about 36 hours.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

                                                At around 5pm, I developed low grade fever. Lasted for an hour or so then went away. In the middle of the night, I developed a high grade fever (101.4), which was gone by the time I woke up. Later in the day a low grade fever returned and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck became enlarged. I called out of work for the next day, Monday, and completed the employee covid testing survey. Monday morning the lymph nodes in my neck were about the size of a golf ball and I was incredibly fatigued. Got tested for COVID (came back negative) and remained with an intermittent low grade fever, fatigue, headache, and sore throat for the remainder.

At 20 mins my throat felt tighter and it was making me cough trying to get air so they gave me 50 ml of benedryl into my right arm. I started to pass out and my breathing was labored so I was given my epipen and taken to the ER. While I was there I was monitored for 4 hours and given 2 more medications. One was a steroid, I?m unsure on the second.

The pain in my arm turned into a big red welt and a hard lump. I took ibuprofen for two days to help with the swelling and headache.  The  lump at the injection sight was  probably 2 inches in diameter and raised a bit.

I had muscle fatigue and overall general fatigue for 48 hours.  Injection site - starting 2 inches down from it - I had red blotchiness (about 24 hours after) - grew (to not quite down to my elbow)and swelled and was hot to touch for 72 hours. It itched a little bit.  The Monday (11th) following I had Dr. visit - to Primary Care Physician - large allergic reaction. He told me to draw a border around it. It continued to spread but not severely and no streaks down my arm. Applied heat to increase blood flow to the area.  The heat helped. It took about seven days to fully go away (the swelling and redness on my arm).

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

A 31-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Feb2021 at 13:15, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Patient did not have known allergies and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included piroxicam (PAXIL) and lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE). Patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient experienced light cough on 11Feb2021 at 14:45 with outcome of recovering, shortness of breath on 11Feb2021  with outcome of recovering, anaphylaxis on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, lost voice entirely on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. The events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. The patient was hospitalized due to the events in Feb2021 for 1 day. Events were considered life threatening. Clinical course: light cough after half an hour from vaccination. Within 2 to 3 hours had lost voice entirely and was suffering from shortness of breath. Her primary physician told her to go to the emergency room or he was calling an ambulance because he said it sounded like anaphylaxis and that her life was in danger. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with intravenous (IV) Decadron Pepcid and epinephrine. She received the 2nd dose on 21Feb2021 at 01:15 PM. Patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.   The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 10 days after receiving the 1st injection of the COVID-19 Pfizer-Biontech injection, I noticed a significant lump on my left collarbone that was palpable - had not been there in the weeks prior. It was somewhat tender to the touch and would move. My PCP examined the lump and ordered a neck ultrasound for the supraclavicular mass which found &#34;mildly prominent lymph nodes in the supraclavicular region without frank lymphadenopathy and one small lymph node that measures approximately 4mm in short axis diameter that is not clearly demonstrating a fatty hilum but is smoothly marginated with a hypoechoic cortex.&#34; PCP then ordered Lactate Dehydrogenase test on 02/12/2021 which was slightly elevated at 629 IU/L (WNL considered as 313- 618 IU/L). Additional labs ordered and collected on 02/13/2021 for LD Isoenzymes, Ferritin and Iron/Transferrin - all within normal limits.  I received my 2nd injection on 02/05/2021. Then the following week the lump was even larger and more prominent and somewhat painful. Reported to my PCP who referred me to a ENT Head/Neck specialist and examined it without concern. Had follow-up appointment 2 weeks later and specialist still not concerned due to the lymphnode becoming smaller in size.  I can still palpate the lymphnode (as of 03/06/2021) but it is much smaller. Plan to wait until 6 weeks after 2nd vaccine injection and then will pursue further follow-up if still palpable.

After ER visit I was advised to take Zyrtec and Benadryl. I&#39;ve paired it with Mucinex to get rid of phlegm build-up and the doctor prescribed Prednisone which I&#39;m going to start today (03/15/2021). So far I have less tightness/less tingling in heart area (still occurs randomly but not as opten) but still get fatigued and breathless real quick. I&#39;ve also had sporadic headaches brain fog, body chills/aches/weakness/difficulty concentrating. Also had face numbness for 4 days.

                                                At the moment of the infection I felt nothing. When I stood up and unfolded mi arm I felt a shooting pain along mi arm all the way to my fingers( don&#39;t remember exactly which fingers) and I started to feel my arm get hot from the site of injection towards my fingers. It lasted for about 1 to 2 minutes. And I had a residual shooting pain for about 5 minutes, coming and going. Then at 9 pm I had my fingers completely swollen, I couldn&#39;t take my rings off. I still have my hand swollen. My arm has the normal pain that the injections is supposed to give, I can&#39;t raise my arm quite well without having pain on it.

                                                10 hours after vaccine, the mild soreness in my left arm increased in severity to constant pain, like I&#39;d been hit with a baseball bat. Swelling and shooting pains in left armpit made it difficult to sleep. The following day, the pain continued, spread to my left breast, and any amount of pressure made the pain worse. The pain continued the third day, with constant chest pain that felt like bad heartburn. The worst of the pain subsided four days after vaccination.

                                                On day of vaccine -- Extreme dizziness  began 1 minute after shot. Dizziness lessened to a tolerable level (I felt I could safely walk around) after about 5 minutes. Dizziness continued to come on sporadically when standing, though lessening in severity and frequency over time. As of today (4/6/21), the dizziness will still occur occasionally when standing or when moving from a sitting to a standing position.  In addition, about 1 hour after the shot, pain began in my jaw and neck area on the left side. This lasted for about three hours. The pain then moved down in my shoulder around the injection site. The pain did not return to my jaw/neck region, and the pain in my shoulder went away after 3 days.  4/2/21 -- Facial and neck numbness began. The left part of my tongue, about one quarter of it, was numb. The left side of my face extending back to my ear and scalp, and down the left side of my neck was numb.  4/3/21 -- Numbness spread down my shoulder, arm, and into my fingers, but was less severe than the numbness in my face and neck.  4/4/21 -- Began 600mg of ibuprofen 3x/day. Numbness decreased after second dose, especially in tongue, but still present. Numbness increased when laying on left side. Weakness in left arm.  4/5/21 -- Increased weakness in left arm and fingers. Numbness still present, but lessened in face and neck. Minor facial swelling in left cheek, left side of tongue tingling and felt slightly swollen. Took 2 Benedryl, did not seem to make a difference.  4/6/21 -- Soreness where left leg connects to hip. Left leg feels a little shaky and weak. Continued symptoms from previous entries. A little brain fog, difficult to concentrate at times. Jaw felt swollen on both left and right side, noticeable when trying to open mouth. Decreased after ibuprofen. Feelings of weakness and general &#34;off&#34; feeling worse when standing versus laying down.

                                                I noticed a rash on the back of both of my hands two days after in the area where the band aid was at the site of vaccination. The band aid mark was there for eight days Five days after the rash had moved to include a similar spot on my other arm and on my neck. I tried to take antihistamines, but the rash did not get better It was little spots that were red and raised and bumpy but not too bothersome. Six days after the vaccine the rash was on my arms, chest, hand and on the back of my heels. By eight days after the shot most of the rash had continued to decrease and now it is almost gone.

At one minute after onset of symptoms, patient was administered 0.3 mL epinephrine IM in the left deltoid, and was transferred to a gurney and then into the rig, where oxygen was applied via non-rebreather mask at 12L/min, and vital signs were taken with  a HR of 96 and BP of 146/113.  Respirations were stridorous and approximately 40-60.  SaO2 after oxygen was high 90&#39;s.   Within the next 3-5 minutes, stridor lessened and client appeared more comfortable and gave a &#34;thumbs up sign&#34;. IM Benadryl was given at approximately 8 minutes post onset.  A second transport ambulance from Medical Center was requested at onset of symptoms and arrived shortly after the dose of Benadryl.  Stridor was minimal and vital signs were HR 95, BP 123/78, with improved respirations, minimal stridor, no accessory muscle use and good air entry.  SaO2 was 100% on oxygen. IV attempt was unsuccessful by local EMT and patient was transferred to the second team for further care and transport to the Medical Center.

About 10 days after second vaccine, I had an ear ache. The next day the left side of my neck was swollen and the left side of my forehead and eye tingled and hurt. I took ibuprofen for 2 days and the lymph nodes started swelling. The 3rd day I woke up with rashes. I went to the doctor and I had shingles in eye. I had blurry vision by the time I got the doctor.

                                                hives all over body; UTI; huge cold sore on nose; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A non-pregnant 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration at Left Arm on 26Jan2021 17:30 (at age of 31 years old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: Sulfa. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC); vitamin d nos; clarithromycin (MACROBID).

No COVID prior vaccination. Nasal Swab on 09Mar2021 was Negative. On 26Jan2021 09:00 PM, within 5 hours of getting my second vaccination, patient broke out in hives all over body. Patient called doctor and was prescribed steroids to help with the hives as antihistamines were not helping. A few days later patient woke up with a huge cold sore on nose which patient never had before. The same day patient was experiencing symptoms of a UTI and was prescribed Macrobid which had taken several times before. Within an hour of taking it patient&#39;s body was covered in hives and throat started to close. Patient immediately went to urgent care where received a shot of Benadryl. Patient was confident this reaction would not have happened if patient had not had this vaccine. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatment (Prednisone and a shot of Benadryl) received. The outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Hives, UTI, Cold sores cannot be excluded.

                                                Standard body aches 30hrs after second dose, lasted 5-8hrs.  Two days after second dose (4/19/21 @ 6pm), lymph nodes on right side of neck, and behind ear/jaw began to swell considerably, followed with excruciating pain.  No fever or other symptoms at any time.  Started 1,000mg of Tylenol every 4hrs, did not help the pain.  Pain was growing as if something could burst, but subsided from a level 10 to a 5 (this lasted 6pm-12am).  Following day (4/20/21) swelling/hard lymph nodes still present, pain level managed at a 5 with Tylenol.  Same day, 4pm, shock of searing pain retuned to level 10, remained for hours, subsided 12am.  Visited doctor on 4/21/21 at 2pm for emergency appt, pain was manageable at a 3, lymph node swelling had gone down, optimistic it was passing.  Doctor found no source of infection, fever, illness.  Was told to call if it didn?t improve in a few days.  Pain started back up at 3:30pm, hit a pain level 10 by 7:20pm.  Neck lymph nodes were swollen and hot, searing hot pain especially behind the earlobe.  Lasted until 8pm.  Saw dentist on 4/22/21 for X-rays to rule out dental abscess, normal results.  Pain has been a 2 all day, without pain relievers.

I woke up in the middle of the night with horrible body aches, a headache, and would switch between shaking/trembling being freezing and dripping sweat. I rotated ibuprofen and Tylenol through the entire next day. Today is 3 days post vaccination and I still have an extremely sore arm, and it feels like I have pain or swollen lymph nodes in my neck and in my arm pit area. Under my arm is extremely tender and it hurts to even have it on the steering wheel to drive. I will randomly get shooting pains in my arms and legs that go away as fast as they came, but very uncomfortable for the few seconds they hit. I also am getting tingling sensations all down my left side (side I had the shot on) that go all the way from the left side of my face down through my leg. I had zero of these symptoms prior to receiving the second dose of Pfizer.

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

The following morning my arm was still sore and I developed a blister behind my left ear and swollen lymph-nodes. The soreness in my arm went away however the blister became worse and started erupting with puss and the lymph-node became larger, tender, and developed sharp . shooting pain. I went to urgent care  on 1/3/2020 and was given oral antibiotics and an antibiotic cream for the blisters. A swab culture was taken for possible shingles. On 1/4/20 I went to clinic as the pain had worsen and resulted in a numbing sensation on my left cheek. The doctor prescribed me antivirals for Shingles and I was given an antibiotic shot in the butt.   I was off work for two weeks. The pain went away around 1/15/20.  The blisters are healed.

By 1030 the pain was now constant and extreme.  I called my doctor and he told me to come into the office to see him. NP saw me and explained that the lymph nodes in my left arm were swollen. Very tender to touch also. He prescribed me Prednisone twice a day for three days, Ibuprofen, and use hot compresses. So far the pain has gotten better.

It took hours just to get out of bed this morning, I felt so unwell.  I took 1000 mg of tylenol before bed on the day I received the vaccine (1/19), but I still woke up with fever. I continued to take 1000 mg throughout the day every 6 hours, which did help. Most symptoms resolved by 1/21 but I continue with fatigue and painful left axillary lymphadenopathy. The node is still really swollen and tender.

A 32-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), hypothyroidism and anxiety. Past drug history included allergy to cefprozil (CEFZIL). Relevant concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). On 12Jan2021, the patient had tachycardia, facial flushing, fatigue, arm pain and swelling. The events required a physician office visit. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 14Jan2021, the patient underwent a COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) which resulted positive. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 12Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 14Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL3302; Expiration date was not reported) on 04Feb2021 (10:00) at a single dose on the left arm, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy/drug store (not a military facility). The patient did not have relevant medical history. Concomitant medication included ongoing amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient previously took a flu shot a couple of months ago, and had no reaction. On 04Feb2021 (10:00), the pharmacy reportedly screwed up, and gave the patient an entire vial of BNT162B2 instead of one dose. The patient was not feeling any side effects then. In Feb2021, the patient had a giant red circle/rash; and she was really swollen, inflamed and in pain (reported as &#34;painful&#34;). The patient did not receive any treatment for the giant red circle/rash and pain. The outcome of the events was recovering for &#39;giant red circle/rash&#39;, &#39;really swollen&#39;, &#39;inflamed&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;gave the patient an entire vial of BNT162B2 instead of one dose&#39;. The reporter had asked about whether she should receive the second dose.  Follow-up (08Feb2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient) included: reporter information, suspect vaccine details and new events (&#39;giant red circle/rash&#39;, &#39;really swollen&#39;, &#39;inflamed&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;).

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday, February 26th, 2021, around 10:20am.  I was fine throughout the day. I was also fine all day on Saturday, February 27th, 2021. Sunday, February 28th, 2021 at 1:30am, I woke up from sleep with double vision, dizziness, and lightheadedness. I went to use my bathroom, and began to feel week. I was still very lightheaded, and weak. I felt as though I was going to faint. My ears started to feel really warm, and I then vomited. I started feeling lightheaded and weak once again, and then suddenly had diarrhea. I was so dizzy, but managed to head to my bed to sleep. Every single day since, I have been dizzy and losing my balance. I wake up, walk around, and sleep dizzy. Then on Friday, March 5th, 2021 I developed a large lump directly under my armpit. I could not take the dizziness any longer and I went to the ER on Monday, March 8th. I was then diagnosed with vertigo and told that I most likely had lymphodenopathy.  Till this day, I am still having dizziness and will be seeing an ENT doctor. I also still have the lump under my armpit. My next dose is, March 19th, 2021.

                                                I had excruciating pain during the injection, which progressively worsened afterward reaching 10/10 L shoulder pain within several hours of the injection. The L shoulder pain was so bad that I could not sleep that night, and the L shoulder pain was unrelieved with OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen. I also noticed a new swollen lymph node under my left armpit the next morning. The L shoulder pain slightly decreased within 48 hours, but I have continued to have limited ROM of my left shoulder, a steady achey pain of my L shoulder, popping and crunching of my L shoulder with movement of my L shoulder, and difficulty abducting or flexing my L arm past 90 degrees since the injection. 2 weeks post-injection I saw an orthopedist who said my symptoms were caused from the vaccine injection and known as SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). He said I was injected too high, leading to injection of the vaccine material into my subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, causing persistent inflammation of the soft tissue leading to bursitis. He had to perform an US guided Toradol injection to attempt to calm down the inflammation caused from the injection.  I have a 4-week follow up with the orthopedist in April. He indicated that an MRI may be required to further evaluate my shoulder.

                                                I developed skin irritation and rash on my chest, neck,  torso, arms, back, legs, pelvic region Thursday evening, three days after receiving vaccine. This include severe itching, redness, inflammation, and visible red bumps. The symptoms are not getting better, so I visited  the Dr.. I was tested for COVID to make sure I was not exposed after the vaccine, and the results were negative for COVID. She prescribed me prescription strength cream, because the Cortisone cream, in combination with Zyrtec and Benadryl  are not working. She did not want to give me anything stronger due to concerns of hindering the effect of the vaccine. It appears to be a mild allergic reaction, but is extremely unpleasant. I cannot stop scratching no matter how hard a try and it is all over my body.

                                                My right ankle started tingling and mildly swelling. Went away after a few hours, and elevating my foot was enough to keep the swelling down in the meantime. I take amlodipine and used to have a problem with ankle swelling when I was on a much higher dose of it, so I was thinking the drugs may be interacting. I did not accidentally take a second dose of amlodipine or anything yesterday, just my usual 5mg that has never caused ankle swelling before.

                                                The day after the second dose I felt sweaty hot and nauseous. I was still really sleepy on the third day. My eye started hurting and I could hear a buzzing sound in both ears. It got worse and worse by day six and I was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. It was really painful underneath my eye on the inside corner with swelling on the top lid. The Steroids seemed to help the problem with my eye. The doctor suspected Bells Palsy. On week two I was prescribed steroids from Lymphadenopathy. I still have the ringing in my ears which is increasing after it had subsided for a little time. I also felt pressure in my ears which is very uncomfortable. Whenever I stop taking the Steroids the ringing in my ears returns like Tinnitus. I plan to reach out to a doctor again because the ringing in my ears has returned after it had improved but was still present after 10 weeks. I did not have any of the same symptoms after the same dose. I have seen a lot of professionals.

                                                The day after the dose of the vaccine I had a headache and body aches with severe back pain in my lower and mid back. My arm became swollen to the size of a baseball around the site of injection. It was a lump on the side of my arm and my arm was numb like maybe a nerve was damaged. My arm was very painful and swollen and itchy. I had the issues with my arm for 10 to 14 days after each dose of the vaccine. I have been having severe backache and like something is sitting on my chest. I still very fatigued after 10 weeks and I have severe back ache. I have been using Lidocaine for the pain and Naproxen and a muscle relaxer at times.

                                                I got the 1st dose on Thursday March 15 around 1:00 PM at the hospital. Around 7:00 PM that evening, I developed a rash across my belly. My husband took me to the ER at the hospital (where I received the vaccine) at about 8:00 PM, and by the time I was seen at about 10:00 PM, the rash was spreading. According to the ER doctor: &#34;Warm, Dry, faint pruritic erythematous rash mainly on the anterior abdominal region blanchable,, not raised, scattered and not confluent patient is scratching at her arms as well and there is a faint erythematous rash is nonraised.  Nonconfluent.&#34;  The doctor gave me 50mg of IV Benadryl and 20mg of IV Pepcid and the rash went away within the following hour.  At the time, I was exactly 31w pregnant with my first. They also monitored the baby&#39;s heartbeat for 20min and did not find any sign of distress. I had no signs of premature labor or anything else that indicated the baby was in danger. I am due May 27th.  The rash is inconsistent with my allergic reactions to the two medications listed. With the tetracycline, I also developed swollen hands/feet and hives.

                                                I didn?t have many side effects in my arm right after the shot other than it being really sore for about 20 min after leaving while I was on the way home. Other than that, it just felt like I had a bruise at the injection sight. I ran a slight fever of 99.4 on and off for the first few days but felt okay. No longer have a fever (but hard to tell because I?m taking Tylenol around the clock) but symptoms have progressed since the first few days and not getting better. Now for the bad...   I?ve experienced tightness in the middle of my chest randomly, extreme fatigue, feet turning more blue/purple than the usual, sleeplessness, and headaches that are in the middle front part of my head (don?t experience these types of headaches. Usually I get more of a pressure headache to the left side of my head). I?m having random shooting pain under my eyes where the eye socket/cheekbones are (not usually correlating with my headaches). Started with the left side and now both get random shooting pains. I?ve never felt the pain under my eyes before until I got the vaccine.   Random falling/rising stars (usually falling stars indicates a migraine) just happening more often than normal. My lymph nodes in my neck where my throat is, have been swollen on both sides worse on my left side (similar to how they react with strep).  My joints and muscles have been worse than ever and swollen all over. Already had issues with my knees but now can hardly walk up and down stairs. I?ve also had ringing in my ears that can sometimes be intense. Vertigo and randomly feel like falling over. Collapsed on stairs a week after vaccine.

                                                Day of vaccination: fine until approx 11:30 pm. I developed a hot/itchy rash on legs followed by a fever of 103, checked with a digital thermometer, and an intense headache. The headache was the worst I?ve ever had and both the headache and fever lasted until the next day. The next day I slept on and off with a 103 fever until 1pm when I finally took Tylenol. The fever and headache slightly receded to about 100 for about 3 hours and then came back and rose to 104. I took more Tylenol and it receded again and came back again. I took two more Tylenol before bed. The next morning I woke up at 7 am and luckily my fever had dropped to 100 and below and I no longer felt the need to take my temp. However my entire upper body felt as though I was in a car accident and had severe whiplash. My neck and head were so painful I couldn?t move them and the arm that I had received the injection was hot and very painful. My other arm was also sore but not as bad and both my hands hurt. My left armpit and a spot under my jaw on the left were also very swollen and painful. I spent the day either unable to move or in tears pacing because the pain was so bad. I periodically took 600 ml of ibuprofen to help alleviate the pain which I think helped a little. I applied an ice pack to my neck and heat pad to the top of my head and rotated a third ice pack between my hands, under my jaw and in my armpit. It was the most severe body pain I?ve ever felt. This lasted until I went to bed. The third day most of the intense pain from the day before was gone but I still had a pretty intense headache and serious stiffness in my neck and head. Which progressively became more intense throughout the day. I continued to use ice and heat and take Tylenol. This pain lasted and increased until going to bed.

                                                Almost a week after my first dose I developed swollen nodes in my collar bone area along with a hard, &#34;cartiladge&#34; like spot beside those.  This was how I woke up the day after getting my period that same week. These large nodes seem to be lymphnode like from what my Doctor had said after checking me. These areas are still swollen, but have decreased in size. I have no other allergies or symptons at this time. We&#39;ve done a blood test to check white blood cell count in the case that I shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of Pfizer vaccine. I&#39;m scheduled to receive this second shot 4/14/21, which I still plan to do so, but in the other arm.

Anaphylaxis at 45 minutes; administered 1 EpiPen at 45 minutes, 1 EpiPen at 50 minutes. Anaphylaxis subsided until 2 hours post-vaccination; administered an additional 2 EpiPens and an additional dose of oral Benadryl. Anaphylaxis did not return. Rash and itching were gone by hour 6 post-vaccine. Fever, chills, sore throat, anorexia, and lethargy developed 12-16 hours post-vaccine. Changes in sense of taste and smell developed 36 hours post-vaccine (could be related to seasonal allergies).

During the weekend of March 6th, I was outside in my yard mulching, pulling out dead plants and planting new ones.  ? March 8th, 2021, I woke up with a swollen LEFT forearm. Went to urgent care. Told to ice and take Aleve. ? On March 9, 2021, I woke up with a swollen face only on LEFT side and went back to urgent care and gave me prednisone 6 days to take.  ? On March 12th, my arm was healing but my face was not and ended up swollen on both sides so I went to a different urgent care and they started me on antibiotics but didn?t not have me treated for anything specific because they were unsure what was happening and recommended to see an allergist.  ? On March 15th, is saw an allergist. He said the swollen arm and face were from an allergic reaction so they did round one of allergy testing for environmental, molds, cats/dogs and some food categories since I thought it was from yard work. I tested positive on almost all 80 tests and had to go back on March 17 for the second round of allergy testing and the final results.  ? On March 17th, I finished round two of allergy testing and was mostly positive on everything. The 8 food categories I was only positive for two, soybean and peanuts.  ? I decided to sign up for allergy drops rather than the shots twice a week. In the meantime, of waiting for the drops to get made I was put on more predisone, allergra, and one tablet of hydroxyzine hcl 25mg at night.  ? A week late my face was still swollen and nothing was working. I called the doctor office and they said to double the hydroxyzine at night. ? On March 29th, my face was still EXTREMELY swollen so we did a CT scan. Had bad sinus infection. He removed the Allegra and put me on one Clemastine 2.68mg in the morning. He then sent me for blood work. I went that evening.  ? On March 31st, I went to get my hair done with the same hair stylist and with the same bleach I?ve been doing on my hair for 13&#43; years with. I have never once broken out or had a reaction but this time I did. My face, neck, chest was boiling red of a rash.  ? On April 5th, I went back and all my blood work was good. However, my face was STILL swollen and hadn?t gone back to normal in since March 7. I stayed on the same meds and started the allergy drops.  ? On April 12th, I went to get my nails done and broke out in another red boiling rash with another reaction. Been going to the same lady for 10&#43; years and never had a reaction or rash.  ? On April 13th, I went to the dentist and got a filling re done and molded for a retainer to get whitening gel. After the numbing shot and molding, I immediately broke out in a red rash all over, face swelled up way bigger than it already was and within 30 mins couldn?t breathe well and had to use my epi pen. I was able to breathe again.  ? On April 14th, I went back to the doctor because I had a red-hot rash all over my body that will not go away and the doctor said it?s unknown of what?s exactly going on right now. I got put on more prednisone for the rash. I go back on April 21st for a follow up.  38 DAYS LATER and my face has NOT ONCE gone back to normal and rashes are still appearing each day. I have went from being allergic to absolutely nothing to what it feels like almost everything. Every time I eat this week something swells up more and rashes appear more red. No medicine is working. It?s getting out of control at this point.

                                                On Sunday, 04/18, I went and received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 12:30 pm on my left arm. It hurt much sooner than the first, within a couple hours. It hurt worse as well. The next morning was Monday. My arm was super sore. I work from home and went by my normal routine. Oatmeal with raspberries and blueberries.  I eat this every day. I started work at 9 AM. Around 9:30 Am or so, I started having sneezing fits. Which I thought was annoying more than anything, but didn&#39;t think anything of it, until the fits developed into my hands itching, burning, turning red. I looked at my face and noticed it was red and swelling.  I&#39;ve had skin allergies before, but nothing outside of hives and maybe a little skin swelling.  I have an allergy to bees. Worse that ever occurred was hives. This instance did not produce hives but a very beet red rash and swelling.  Then very quickly after, my tongue started swelling and my throat started tightening. I called my mother as I noted this was life threatening and went to the ER. I was informed I had experienced anaphylaxis.  My heart rate going in to the ER was 166. I have never experienced this in the 32 years I&#39;ve lived before.  I was administered an Epi and steroids. As soon as I realized what it was, even in my panic, I was lucky to make a judgment call to save my life. The doctor said to throw out the berries just in case. The odd thing is, I eat this every day...no issues. I realize it is rare for reactions to be delayed, but was made aware it is possible.  I was not stung by anything to make this occur.

                                                On 4/12/21 I woke up with a painful bump and rash on my left eyebrow. On 4/13/21 I went to the doctor and was misdiagnosed with cellulitis. I began treatment with antibiotics (clindamycin). The rash was unresponsive to the treatment and I started experiencing terrible pain in my face, eye and scalp. There was intense pressure in my eye and pain in my left ear. I started forming blisters on my eyebrow, side of my nose and temple. On 4/16 I woke up with my eye nearly swollen shut. I went to urgent care the same day and was diagnosed with shingles that was affecting my trigeminal nerve. I was prescribed Valtrex antiviral for 7 days, and remained on the antibiotics. I was also given pain medication (oxycodone). I was referred to Optometry to check to make sure the shingles was not affecting my eyeball and to ensure there was no indication of damage to my vision. As of today (4/24/21) my blisters have mostly scabbed over, the swelling has reduced substantially and the pain is far less intense. I still feel like a quarter of my face has a moderate sunburn, have an itchy eye and a bit of pressure in my eye still. My vision was not impacted and I may have some small scars from the blisters.

Caller also states that she sat for 30 minutes and her throat felt tingly, but has subsided. She alerted a healthcare professional there who observed her and cleared her to leave.

This 32-year-old female patient (No pregnant) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: ER8737) on 05Apr2021 06:15 PM at single dose on Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was Immunocompromised, chronic migraines. Known allergies: Just seasonal allergies. Wheat and soy allergy, restricted diet. Concomitant medications (in two weeks) included fluticasone propionate (FLONASE) for allergies (nasal spray), mirtazapine (REMERON). No other vaccine in four weeks. Patient stated that I had the normal side effects of numbness and soreness in my left arm from 05Apr2021. Three days later I had allergy symptoms manifest, Thursday (the shot was on a Monday), and had to go get allergy medication. My throat felt restricted, I was having difficulty breathing, and my body felt like it was swelling up everywhere. I had hives and raised bumps and bruising on my left arm where the shot went in from 09Apr2021 ( reported as 08Apr2021 12:00 PM). Swelling noticeably went down after the allergy medication and breathing returned to normal. On Tuesday, 13Apr2021, after about three days of flu-like symptoms (nauseau, tiredness, body aches), I was admitted to the ER with a complex migraine and parathesia in my right arm, though the shot was in my left arm, and the migraine was in my left side of my head. I feel that this was an allergic reaction that happened belatedly and is a much stronger reaction than anyone else I have seen take the same dose and the same vaccine. AE resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was Allergy medication from 08Apr2021 to 13Apr2021 two IV&#39;s &#43; Benadryl. Outcome of the event was Recovering. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

I went to my PCP the next day, and they took pictures.   It&#39;s been two weeks and I am still managing intermittent pain in my left shoulder and arm. It has become more painful in the last 3 days. 5/5.

A 32-year-old non-pregnant female reported for herself who received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: En5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 29Jan2021 at 09:30 (at 32-years age) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not have any allergy to medications, food, or other products. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications that patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D NOS); vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) and zinc (ZINC).

                                                5 minutes after vaccination, I felt unwell. I sat with EMS that was onsite. HR was 160&#39;s, BP 160&#39;s systolic. Right arm went numb in first 5 minutes and my face went numb after 15 minutes post injection. After sitting 45 minutes with EMS my vitals stabilized and no numbness present. I walked to the car, sat in the car for 10 minutes and then I went into anaphylaxis. My airways began to close. My husband got the EMS on site and I was taken by ambulance to the ER. I was given IM Benadryl in the ambulance. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl and IV steroids.   After anaphylaxis event I had difficulty breathing for 3 weeks from enlarged lymph nodes. I had extreme shortness of breath for the 2 weeks following injection in that I had to crawl up the flight of stairs to the second level of our home.   About the 3rd week after injection, I began having full body itching  with no known stimuli. Only benadryl would treat it. I was on allegra or zyrtec daily. I would also develop 1 or 2 hives on my right arm.   4 weeks after injections I was reacting to food and drink. I could not drink alcohol- gin or vodka- it would result in full body itching and a few hives. I did a course of prednisone, and it decreased my allergic reactions and I felt almost normal for several months.  On May 8th, 2021 I had be experiencing great stress since February from a family member&#39;s cancer diagnosis. I had a crying event and immediately after I had an allergic reaction to gin, which had not occurred since the course of steroids.  Today is 5/13 and I have had 2 additional allergic reactions: one involving food and the other flowers. None of which I have ever been allergic to before. I have full body itching and I am now developing hives more often.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

My whole left side from my neck to my elbow I would feel tremendous pain.  Days passed and nothing would get better so I spoke with my supervisor and she recommended me to go to the ER where they did some labs (blood work).  About 2 weeks later the pain in my left side subsided but the swelling on my neck and the &#34;bump&#34; never went away, although not painful. I received the second dose on 01/04/2021 and the same pain returned from my neck down to my elbow and the neck is swollen again and in pain. I decided not to go to the ER for the second dose and did not obtain medical help so far.

She did work on her feet but she wasn&#39;t working on her feet for that week, so she just didn&#39;t know what was causing the swelling and within the last couple of days in Dec2020 she had a quick heart rate like her pulse, it&#39;s not that high but for she it was high it was like 112, 115 as her resting heart rate, so it&#39;s just been having like heart palpitations kind of, she just wanted to report that and kind of see if other people were getting that as a symptom possibly from vaccine. She had in her past had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. She had swollen legs like edema, so she was just hoping. And then the patient stated that she wasn&#39;t tired at the starting, so she wasn&#39;t tired the same day&#39; (could not be clarified further). No treatment was received for all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

It was very mild and resolved within 1 day.  On 1/4/21, she noticed L axillary lymphadenopathy returned. On 1/5/21, it had spread to her right axillary lymph node.  It continued to worsen until Friday 1/8/21 when she reported to me and our physician to inquire about possible deferment of vaccination.  She still has swelling and tenderness at both axillary lymph nodes today 1/11/21. Severity is moderate in that it is painful, but not debilitating.

Which is still a little swollen but improving; pain at injection site/painfulness at the injection site; shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included immunosuppression. Concomitant medication included ongoing vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for immunosuppresion. The patient got a couple of the side effects listed. She developed painfulness at the injection site, and it was red a couple of days. She is wondering if she needs to be worried about getting the second one. It was pretty painful that night. It was pretty painful for the next day. If someone barely brushed up against it, it was very painful. Two days later, her husband noticed her shoulder was very red. And then she realized there was a defined red mark where the injections was. The pain is fine now. She didn&#39;t get a rash or have trouble breathing. She did have a swollen lymph node a couple of days later. Which is still a little swollen but improving. She does take an immunosuppressant. The outcome of the events pain at injection site and shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was recovered, while recovering for the event swollen lymph node a couple of days later was recovering.

                                                It started about 20 minutes after vaccination. I started to feel a rush of heat like a hot flash and my heart was racing while I was driving home. My cheeks and lips were swelled up. My tongue was starting to swell but I could still breathe. I was wheezing so I took a Benadryl and then took another four hours later. I felt very light headed for the rest of the day. The light headedness and dizziness stayed for a few days with a headache. I did not have second dose on the recommendation of my doctor. I ended up contracted Covid-19 three weeks after the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the first vaccine, started experiencing a little neck pain and swelling on and off for 2 month since first vaccination on December 30th. After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

                                                I developed acute genital ulcers on 1/7/2021, 2 days after receiving the second dose (1/5/2021). No history of STIs or exposures (not sexually active). I did also have a single ~2 cm tender axillary lymphadenopathy on the site of the vaccination that persisted for ~4 days, as well as body aches at 12-36h after vaccination. No inguinal lymphadenopathy, fever, chills.  I visited the doctor on day 5 of genital ulcers at which time HSV and VZV testing were performed which were both negative. Due to possibility of it being shingles (I did have chickenpox as a child), I took a 7 day-course of valacyclovir. Ulcers began to resolve around day 7 after onset and resolved completely after about 2 weeks with no recurrence.

ER doctor requested blood work and covid test. covid test was negative, blood work came back normal. had a bloody nose before i came home. diagnosed there with post vaccination reaction. told to take benadryl and ibuprofen/tylenol. each day i woke after vaccination unable to move my neck (including today). it takes me several hours to be able to move my neck muscles. waking up 4/8/21 my right side was temporarily paralyzed but regained slow achy movement throughout the day. each day after vaccination joint pain somewhere in my body takes place and nerve pain is often associated. 4/10/21-4/13/21 i have experienced sciatic nerve pain down both sides all the way down to my toes. my nose and throat are still swollen. i am still having to take benadryl daily due to throat swelling. my throat and neck itch.

After about three days, the swelling and tenderness had expanded to both armpits, the entire collarbone area, neck and throat (difficulty swallowing). It&#39;s been four days now and still experiencing side effect, which hasn&#39;t subsided.  I also experienced muscle pain, joint stiffness (especially in neck and shoulder), fever/chills and fatigue for the first 24 hours.

A 33-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 04Feb2021 (at the age of 33-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. On 05Feb2021, the patient found a lump under her left armpit which was the same side she received the vaccine on. The lump was about the size of golf ball, at first it was not movable but now it was movable, and pain of the lump stayed same as well as the size. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                throat swelling; uvula swelling; facial swelling; tongue swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A non-pregnant 33-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in right arm on 08Apr2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 33 years old) (Lot Number: EW0150, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included diabetes, HTN heart failure, migraine, and hypertension (HTN). Concomitant medications included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO PROVERA) taken from 07Apr2021 to an unspecified stop date; omeprazole (PRILOSEC); clarithromycin (CLARITIN); allopurinol (ELAVIL); magnesium; venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR); warfarin sodium (COUMADIN); digoxin; metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR); torsemide; acyclovir; aspirin; topiramate (TOPAMAX); insulin aspart (NOVOLOG); and atorvastatin.  The patient previously took bactrim and experienced allergies.  The patient experienced throat swelling, uvula swelling, facial swelling, and tongue swelling on 08Apr2021 at 10:00 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient received epinephirine, solumedrol, Pepcid, and Benadryl for the events.  It was unknown if the patient has COVID prior to vaccination and unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The patient is recovering from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pharyngeal swelling, enlarged uvula, swelling face and swollen tongue cannot be excluded. While a diagnosis was not provided, the clinical picture and treatment received by the patient point to the likelihood of an allergic reaction. The information available in this report is limited. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Extreme fatigue a couple hours after receive, maybe around  2p. Took a nap for maybe 2 hours, face started to feel itchy and tight. Around 8pm I look in the mirror and I notice my face looked a little puffy, and tiny bumps around my nose and mouth.  The next morning, around 5am, my eyelids and lips were noticeable swollen and the hives (tiny bumps) were covering my face, it was itchy mostly around my nose and mouth. I took Zyrtec every day for three days. The swelling went down after the second day, the hives (tiny bumps) cleared up around day three, my skin  was completely normal after about a week. On April 13, I started to feel fatigued ( same way I did after I got the vaccine on the 3rd),  the next morning my eyelid and lips were swollen and hives and itchness returned. I contacted doctor and he suggested taking Allegra 24 during the day and Benadryl at night ) if I?m itchy. He almost prescribed prednisone for 3 days,but only take  if my face was still swelling the next day.  On the 14th, my face was still swelling so I started the prednisone. It took about 4 days for my face to clear up completely

Around 36 hours after vaccine, I developed fatigue, aching body, swollen lymph nodes in my throat - especially on the side where I had the shot - that made my throat sore when swallowing. I had a fever around 100-101 from Sat. 4/24-Mon 4/26, spiking up to 102.6 at the highest point on Sun 4/25 in the AM (3 days post-shot). My fever went away for good the afternoon of Mon 4/26 (4.5 days post-shot). My swollen lymph nodes that caused pain while swallowing took another ~24 hours to resolve (5.5 days post-shot). I rested, lots of fluids, took tylenol and advil, etc. on advice of my PCP.

                                                angioedema; hives; in lips tingling at times; itching; rash; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other hcp. A 33-year-old female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: Unknown) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on Dec2020 (at the age of 32-year-old) as single, and dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 as single for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 2021, Reporter&#39;s daughter had the first Pfizer vaccine in DEC 2020. The second in JAN 2021, 10 days after she broke out in hives and had some angioedema, in lips tingling at times, no throat closures.  Eye angioedema was the first sign, around the eyes, that went away and was off and on. On day 10 she woke up with this and has had it ever since. angioedema of the lips on and off.  Since Jan 21 she&#39;s been headed to toe with hives they never go away, some days her legs are just covered. On 2021, the reporter sated that, 5 days after 2nd vaccine angioedema around both eyes and that was gone now, she&#39;s been to dermatologist, immunologist and primary care physician and they&#39;ve tried, prednisone, IV Benadryl, Zyrtec, Allegra, also done oatmeal baths for itching, dermatologist wanted to put her on cyclosporine, she didn&#39;t want to go on it because it&#39;s a strong antibiotic. They also gave her pepcid.  Reporter asked to have anyone else had anything like this and why it is lasting so long. Reporter stated that everyone was saying, it&#39;s an immune response, and give it time and see if it goes away.  her daughter woke up in a huge snowstorm the first time she had the angioedema with Mouth, she went to the Emergency Room, they gave her IV Benadryl, kept her there for a little while, sent her home on prednisone pack, not tapered, just 5 days of high dose prednisone. When the prednisone was finished, it came back with a vengeance. Then she went to her Primary Care Physician to see if she had any suggestions. They wanted her to go back on the Prednisone but on a tapered dose, but, she didn&#39;t&#39; want to take it because she was afraid it would come back worse than ever.  It never got better, not even on the high dose prednisone. Other than put her on the prednisone, there wasn&#39;t really anything more. 4 Months later it hasn&#39;t settled down.  Reporter asked her daughter to come to where she lives and see Dermatologist, and he ordered a bunch of labs and got it back and it all looked fine. He wanted to start her on cyclosporine, she wanted to wait, didn&#39;t want to take it. Reporter stated, &#34;It wipes the immune system out. They give it to transplant patients. they all say It&#39;s an immune response, it should settle down. Her daughter has been trying to change her diet, eating things low in histamines, cut out tomatoes, cut out cheeses, everything high in histamines, it doesn&#39;t make a difference.  Reporter stated, One day they are not quite so bad and then she wake&#39;s up and she was covered. Her daughter can&#39;t walk, or swim cause hot and cold makes her break out, or makes it worse, because it never goes away. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Immune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.    No follow up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events and the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

My HR shot up to 99 and BP was at 135/83. (My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest.) This level of elevated cardiovascular output was endured for about 3 hours.   Treatment included meditation and conscious, focused intent to slow HR down and reduce BP.  Lymph nodes were rock hard and it became difficult to talk or swallow. This seemed more of a normal vaccine response, it only lasted for about an hour, after I took my immune boosting supplements.

                                                After the second injection, I was experiencing what I thought was a lupus flare up. I needed to get into a new rheumatologist so that took some time getting into with my current insurance. I was experiencing a tremendous amount of joint and muscle pain. I have a Low grade fever off and on as well as my lupus butterfly rash on my face and a few sores in my nose. All symptoms I have had when dealing with a lupus flare. One thing that was different was muscles being pulled for doing very little. My back and neck muscles kept getting pulled often. Extreme dry eyes/nose- all which was similar autoimmune symptoms I have had in the past. Extreme periods of nausea, but I have been unable to take certain medications I use to be able to take. I can not take any nausea medications because it now will give me a horrible migraine that last for days. My primary doctor gave me a steroid dose pack to help me until I could get into my rheumatologist and I had a horrible reaction to them with extreme diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and migraines. None of those symptoms to medications has happened in my past. My symptoms started was a gradual increase over the time period after getting my vaccine. Not all at once. But after about a week after getting the vaccine it started to happen slowly to the point where I am today. The doctors ran various test for my lupus and all of my inflammation lab markers came back extremely high. But none of my lupus/autoimmune markers came back as active. I also ended up going to the ER concerned with chest pain- but after many test nothing was conclusive or found. I have a follow up with a cardiologist  pending

A 33-year-old patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), the first dose via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 29Apr2021 at 19:00 (lot number: EW0169PF) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included felt her lymph nodes on the left side of her neck (For the past five years) and feel a little tender (there is no correlation for when they get tender/ It does not happen seasonal, or when she gets her periods. It just happens everyone in awhile). The patient&#39;s mother passed away suddenly on 15Jul2021 from heart attack. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Vitamin C, fish oil, vitamin D3, vitamin B12 and methylfolate, all (for the past week) from unspecified date. The patient was calling about the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. She had had a negative reaction to the covid vaccine. About a week and a half later, on Saturday 08May2021, she woke up with a stiff neck. She took some Tylenol. Over the next few days, she still had a stiff neck. On the left side of her neck, her lymph nodes are swollen. The next few days, it progressed. It became extremely painful, to the point that she felt mentally delirious. She made an appointment with her primary care physician. She saw her primary care physician on Tuesday, 04May2021. Her primary care physician sent her for blood work and prescribed her an anti anxiety medication. Her primary care physician told her that this was her bodies response to the covid vaccine. Her primary care physician had seen this in a few other patients. She left her primary care physician&#39;s office, in pain, felt anxious, emotional and upset. A few days later, and her pain was so terrible. Her blood work came back negative for an auto immune disease. Her blood work showed that her vitamin D levels were extremely low. She had known that for awhile and took supplements for it. Her pain became so bad, that she went to a walk in clinic. She felt like she got better care at the walk in clinic versus her primary care physician&#39;s office. The walk in clinic doctor put her on a prednisone nine day taper. The brand name of the prednisone is Deltasone. She was taking Deltasone 20mg tablets. The walk in clinic doctor also prescribed her a muscle relaxer named Robaxin. She was taking Robaxin 500mg. It was the third day of taking the steroid and muscle relaxer. She was still feeling discomfort and pain from the bottom of her ear, to her elbow on her left side. Especially around her injection site, she still had the sensation. For stiff neck: she thought that the steroid and muscle relaxer have covered up some of the pain, but she could still feel it. She was now better than she was on Saturday, 15May2021. She felt similar to what she was feeling on Saturday, 08May2021. For on the left side of her neck, her lymph nodes are swollen: They were not as tender now. She felt like it was also hard to tell because of her taking a muscle relaxer and steroid. She thought that prednisone decreased inflammation. For she was in extreme pain, to the point that she felt mentally delirious: On 07May2021, she would rate it a seven out of ten on a pain scale. On 15May2021, she would rate it a ten out of ten on a pain scale. Now she was feeling like it was a six out of a ten on a pain scale. She thought that it was improved. But she was still skeptic to see how she felt once all of her steroids were gone. She was very aware of what was going on with her body. She knew that something was going on. On 15May2021, the pain was unbearable. For she felt anxious, emotional and upset: Since 15May2021, her anxiety had subsided. Ever since she saw the doctor at the walk in clinic, and the doctor gave her a plan of taking prednisone and muscle relaxers. Her anxiety was pretty high end whenever she thought about getting the second dose of the covid vaccine. She had to cancel her second dose of the covid vaccine appointment. It correlated with the steroid. She wanted to give herself time to be off the steroid. She rescheduled her appointment for the second dose of the covid vaccine for Saturday, 05Jun2021. She was a hair stylist. She had heard from a ton of people, about ton of peoples stories, where the second dose of the covid vaccine gave people more of a reaction. She was very fearful to get the second dose. She was going to ask to get the second dose in her right arm. The events result in physician office visit and did not result in emergency room visit. The outcome of the events &#34;she was in extreme pain, to the point that she felt mentally delirious&#34;, &#34;She woke up with a stiff neck&#34;, &#34;On the left side of her neck, her lymph nodes are swollen&#34; was recovering, for the event &#34;She felt anxious, emotional and upset&#34; was recovered on 15May2021, while the other events were unknown.

                                                I received the vaccine at 10:30 am. About two hours later I noticed a minor headache. By 4pm I had a moderate pounding headache. Around 4:30pm, I noticed minor unilateral scalp, facial and neck numbness on the left side. These symptoms lasted about a week, but slowly improved. Four days after the vaccine I had very tender lymph nodes on the left ear area. Today marks two weeks exactly since I received the vaccine and two days ago I noticed slight increase in numbness on the left cheek again which again, is slowly improving.  However, I also wear Invisalign at sometimes notice that I bite my cheek while asleep. I also wear N95 masks four days of the week which are quite tight on the face.   The injection site (Left deltoid) was moderately sore for the first few days and still two weeks later has minor soreness the comes and goes.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

                                                I have an infection at the injection site. I believe this could happen with any vaccine but wanted to report just in case. I am experiencing a large circle (a little smaller than a baseball) of swollen red skin that is painful around the injection site. Last night, the lymph nodes in my armpit, neck and collar bone on the right side swelled up and were painful. I feel fatigued.

                                                -0715 vaccine administered. -0735 started to feel dizzy/off and right side of tongue felt like it was mildly swelling and itchy. -0735 asked to have blood pressure taken as know when I am having anaphylaxis my blood pressure escalates. -0740 took blood pressure and it was 141/86 in right arm. Normal is 110s/60s-70s. No anxiety feelings.  -0740 throat started to have increased mucous production. Had the tickle and tightness in throat. Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it. Didn&#39;t want to take that when I knew I was about to get it in the ER and knowing self hadn&#39;t progressed that far. Felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

Almost immediately, I felt a pain go down to my wrist and across my chest. We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

                                                First day after, 23rd, arm was pretty sore. 24th it was fine. Going in to the 25th - getting difficult to walk; joints were very rigid. Both hips and both knees and ankles -whole lower body very rigid. Muscles were really tight and tense. It felt like all muscles were engaged stiff and wouldn&#39;t relax. Joints wouldn&#39;t bend (butt on down). I couldn&#39;t walk. During the day on 25th those symptoms still persisted but could walk a little - very challenging - couldn&#39;t ambulate well and it was painful to walk. Day of 26th and symptoms could still persisted and seemed like the morning wasn&#39;t as bad but by evening it was really bad again. I didn&#39;t equate it to the vaccine because on the 24th I felt fine. 28th I tried to work but left early to go to Dr because I had trouble walking that entire shift.  Dr ran tests - Lyme Disease and CBC and SED rate and Rapid Strep test and Antistreptolycin - if any antibody in body for strep; rheutomoid factor ; TSH; C reactive protein; Uric Acid; pathology for Lyme Serology  IG/IGG; ANA with Pathology - all was C reactive proteins was elevated - Put on Prednisone Pack and that made it better until most symptoms resolved and I felt like I could move again. I ran out on a Sunday and by Monday I back to not being able to move again. Got blood drawn Wednesday (Jan 6, 2021). And they rechecked CBC, SED rate; C reactive proteins and rheumotoid factor; CCP antibodies; and they did a comprehensive metabolic panel. And those were all normal except C reactive proteins was elevated but not as much as initial test. A week later added CK test - tested for muscle breakdown and that was normal  Jan 6, 2021 - meloxicam was prescribed and that managed most of my symptoms but I can only use Tylenol with and not Ibuprofen (which doesn&#39;t work as well).    Urgent care initially went to.

She noted additional swelling and discomfort and 2 days later area was raised, red/purple and noted as painful and itchy. She sought out help from a physician who noted the area as possible cellulitis and prescribed cephalexin. 2 days later the patient reported to Urgent Care noting more pain and worsening swelling at the site on her Right palm. It was also noted she had a swollen, red lesion on the Right side of her back adjacent to her right scapula.  The patient was diagnosed with shingles and was started on Valtrex.  Due to timeline and closeness to vaccination dose, consideration of an immune modulated reaction.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes under both armpits; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 34-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), intramuscular in left arm, on 09Jan2021 at 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ibuprofen and lorazepam. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK5730) on 18Dec2020 at 06:30 PM (intramuscular in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 15Jan2021 at 12:00 AM, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes under both armpits a week after administration of the vaccine. It was unknown if treatment was given for the adverse event. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the event.

Noticed left armpit soreness 7 days after vaccination on 1/23, and noticed left collarbone lymph node swelling 9 days after vaccination on 1/25. It?s possible they were swollen before this and I may not have noticed. Lymph nodes are still swollen as of today (1/28).

I am getting better but I am not back to my normal routine yet.

                                                On Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and swollen lymph nodes in my neck/collarbone area. As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

After about 20 minutes my face and lips became numb, my cheeks turned red and hot to the touch, my face started to swell and it felt like my blood pressure dropped, I became dizzy. I took 50mg of Benadryl within 30 minutes of the initial onset of symptoms. All symptoms were gone within an hour of taking the benadryl. Over the next couple hours I experienced discomfort/soreness at the injection site and that tattoo on the same arm as the injection site became raised, hot and itchy. As of 3/3/2021 the only symptom remaining is the soreness at the injection site.

Soon started a high fever of 103.6. Also had body aches, headache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, left lymph nodes in left arm pit are visible swollen and painful . The pain was so severe that I could not stop moving my legs. On a scale of 1-10, my overall pain level was at a 7. If I had not just had the COVID vaccine, I would have gone to the emergency room with how bad the symptoms were. The next morning all of the symptoms had subsided except for the swollen lymph nodes in my left arm pit. They are still visibly swollen, aching, and painful to the touch. They are so swollen they are restricting movement of my arm.

By Saturday, the headache was back with the nausea and I began feeling very itchy. When I woke on Sunday, I had hives and a rash all over my face and most of my left side, which is the side I got my shot. Called Dr Monday and was sent to urgent care, who then sent me to the ER. Heart rate was high, hives, rash, headaches, nausea, swollen eyes and face, swollen lymph nodes

                                                Saturday night (3/13/21) and into Sunday morning (3/14/21), patient began feeling discomfort in lower right leg. Discomfort and feeling of swelling continued through Sunday evening. Monday (3/15/21) patient began using compression stocking and elevating leg, which eased some discomfort. Slight swelling, discomfort, and heat in the leg continued throughout entire week. DVT presumed. Contacted physician. Treatment for DVT and treatment dosage (Fondaparinux 7.5mg) commenced Wednesday (3/17/21) through to date. Discomfort has dissipated but slight swelling still remains. Appears to be getting better each day, although a very slow progression. Patient history of antiphospholipid syndrome has been managed for over fifteen years with blood thinners. Onset of a clotting event always followed a justifiable cause. No spontaneous/unexplainable clotting events to date. Patient otherwise healthy without any other current event which could explain a blood clot following vaccination. Reporting this information as it may be helpful in determining whether persons with APS or similar condition should receive Covid-19 vaccination. Note: this information being provided by patient.

                                                This reaction has occurred twice since my first vaccination.  One at 9 days post vaccine and the other at 20 days post vaccine.   Sudden onset of a hot, swollen, mildly itchy red lacy rash over several areas of the body starting with the face. My face turned bright red and splotchy and was very hot. Then it spread to my neck and chest, then my arms, elbows, and hands, then to my stomach and thighs and butt. I took 2 Benadryl within ten minutes of each reaction starting and the rash slowly disappeared over the next 30 minutes after taking the medicine. No residual rash was left after the reaction.   The rash appeared on an empty stomach both times and without any environmental triggers. No other trigger has been identified.  No other bodily systems were involved in the reaction other than the skin.

                                                After about 3 hours of having taken the vaccine, my face started to swallow. I took allergy medicine (cetirizine hydrochloride tablets, 10mg/antihistamine) and got much better. After about 24 hours my face was back to normal. The reaction, treatment and recovery was very similar to what happens when I take aspirin, ibuprofen, or metamizole.

                                                1 April, woke up at 0800 with slight headache and felt fatigued but most noticeably my voice sounded weird and my throat was extremely hoarse while talking in work meeting and I had to constantly cough to clear it. I was having a bit of trouble swallowing as well. In the afternoon, my headache got worse and I had diarrhea. Around 7:45pm I started feeling extreme itchiness and swelling in my tongue. This didn&#39;t improve, so I took 25mg Benedryl at 8:20pm, at which time my vitals were normal, but noticeably lower than usual with a HR of ~60, BP of 100/70, O2 sat 99% and normal temp. I also took another 1000mg Tylenol at 9:30pm and went to bed.  2 April, 0730 woke up and my throat and tongue started swelling again and were very itchy. I began have difficulty breathing and swallowing saliva. I also could not swallow a banana easily, so I stopped eating it. I also had some wheezing that would only go away with a cough. Took 25mg more of Benedryl and went to urgent care immediately because breathing was becoming increasingly difficult.   Treatment: At urgent car I was diagnosed with anaphylactic reaction due to vaccination and given another 25mg Benedryl injection and 10mg Prednisone. Vitals were BP:144/90, HR:83, TMP 98.5. Doctor considered epinephrine instead of Benedryl but &#34;didn&#39;t want to have to send me to the ER&#34;. I was monitored for about 45 minutes and while my difficulty breathing did not improve much, it also did not worsen. I was sent home with Medrol steroid pack, Atarax and an EpiPen. My breathing ability did not return to normal until about ~3 days later.

At 3:24 pm she developed a mild, red rash that was not raised on her chest and back. After 5 minutes, the rash spread to her neck. She did not have a generalized rash or itching at that time but within 20 minutes she developed itching to the area affected, with no breathing difficulty or throat swelling noted. VS were checked and within normal limits at the time the event started and 15 minutes afterward. After 30 minutes, she stated she felt her skin on her neck was &#34;tight,&#34; and after 45 minutes she developed mild swelling on the left forearm. No breathing difficulty, no oropharyngeal edema or generalized hives or itching were present at any time. EMS was offered and called at 4:13 pm as symptoms seemed to progress and BP became elevated. EMS arrived 4:23 pm. She was given 50 mg Benadryl IM and transported to hospital for observation out of an abundance of caution.

                                                Mid cycle spotting. First day of last period was 3/27/2021, and this unusual midcycle spotting occurred starting 4/11/2021 and lasted 3 days. Usual 33 day cycles are very regular and spotting mid cycle is abnormal for me.   ALSO, I experienced an enlarged and painful lymph node in my collar bone area which began a couple days after my vaccine dose and finally resolved as of 4/19/2021.

                                                I believe I had a delayed reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine that appeared three weeks after my second dose. My lips swelled up rather severely and were burning and very itchy. When I first went to the doctor, we concluded it was a contact dermatitis reaction to some spicy wings I ate. However, the problem persisted for almost five days and started to get worse, which (I&#39;m told) is very unlikely for a food allergy. I ended up going to another primary doctor the next day and she is the one who ended up prescribing an oral steroid and topical steroid. That finally took care of the issue. I would have reported this through VAERS sooner, but was not aware of it. A few days after I started the steroid, I happened to have a dermatology appointment, and my dermatologist said she was aware of delayed reactions tied to vaccines and believed I had angioedema from the COVID-19 vaccine.

That night woke up 1:30 am with worst headache I&#39;d ever had all across top of my skull, diarrhea, started seeing black when I blinked, then fainted on bathroom floor. Felt like someone was throwing buckets of cold water on me. Dizzy, couldn&#39;t get off bathroom floor. Tinnitus off and on. Mom was with me and she called GP emergency nurse who urged us to go to ER, decided to wait because I felt too ill to move. 100 degree fever. Stayed ill like I had the flu for next several days in bed. Noticed heart seemed irregularly fast from time to time, and dizzy when I stand up. Brain fog was very strong. By 4th day body aches started to improve but still very weak. Legs shaking in the shower, feeling sick if I walk or stand more than 20 minutes. Day 8th, Apr. 15th went to ER because of increasing weakness in legs. They wanted to do spinal tap and MRI, but after neurologist evaluated he said my reflexes are too good for GBS. ER also nasal swabbed me, negative for COVID. Day 10 fever came back, 100 degrees. Now it&#39;s day 19. I&#39;m consistently weak in my legs and arms. Saw the neurologist again last week. He said if I&#39;m still not better this Thursday he will give me an EMG, so I plan to proceed with that. My legs still shake in the shower. Haven&#39;t felt well enough to drive or walk down the street because my legs and arms are still weak and I feel like I have the flu if I exert myself. Have to rest in bed a lot. Sunlight hurts my eyes. Don&#39;t feel like myself, still feel like I&#39;m having brain fog. Headaches off and on ongoing. If I rest in bed for four hours or so, I start to feel better, but If I exert myself at all I become nauseous and dizzy again. I have spent most of the last 19 days in bed. I?ve not felt well enough to drive my car or go for a walk outside this whole time.

                                                I started to experience skin tenderness, joint pain and congestion around 22h after my second dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Symptoms improved after taking 650mg of Acetaminophen one time. Experienced light headache starting around 26h post vaccination, it has not gone away with Acetaminophen. Developed chills and skin tenderness accompanied by joint pain again around 34h after vaccination and developed a fever of 37.6 degrees C around 36h after vaccination. I also feel my neck ganglia swollen and it pains me.

                                                On Saturday, the day after I got the vaccine the only symptom I had was tiredness. I caught a cold from members of my household, so I spent the weekend with symptoms like sneezing and light fever that went away on Monday.  On Wednesday (5th day) around 10 am all my body started itching. I found out that I had a bad rash all over my body, it was redness in my chest, stomach, arms, back, and legs. Only some spots with hives but the redness migrated throughout to different areas during the day. I went to ER and while I was there my face started to swell. They gave me the following medication: (1) Famotidine 20 mg oral tablet, (3) dexamethasone 10 mg injectable solution, and (2) diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 mg oral tablet. By the end of the day, all redness and swell disappeared. They prescribed my Prednisone 10 mg for 5 days to be taken 3 pills in the mornings.  On Thursday (6th day) I woke up with the top of my hands red but migrated to the arms after an hour. I took Prednisone as prescribed, but redness and hives kept appearing in different areas of my body, less than the day before but progressing. By 7 pm face started to swell again under my eyes and cheeks. Went to ER again and they asked me to take Benadryl 50mg at night with Famotidine 20 mg and keep taking it every 6-8 hours, (Famotidine every 12 hours) and continue with Prednisone as prescribed.  Today is Friday, the time is 11:30 am (7th day) and I already took Prednisone with Famotidine and so far, I don?t see any redness.

Day two I started experiencing tingling and twitching of the face. Day three I had to go to the ER because of facial droop. The doctor said possible bell palsy and sent me home to follow up with normal doctor. Day four I went to normal doctor and by end of the day ended up in the ER with facial droop and body tremors. I was admitted into the hospital for day 5 through day 7 where I had CT scan, MRI and spinal tap. We are still awaiting the test results but I am still experiencing side effects. My speech is now being effected along with the body tremors. I am waiting to get set up with PT, OT and speech therapy to start that process but we are unsure of the test results at this time.

Follow-up #01 (PRD/SRD 13Apr2021) received from a contactable consumer was processed together with initial information.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8737) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 07Apr2021 (at 12:30 or 1:00pm) as single dose, 0.3 ML, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 08Apr2021, patient experienced persistent pain in neck, upper back area. On 09Apr2021, diarrhea that lasted a few days and upset stomach. On an unspecified date, patient mentioned that in the morning its worse, and it took her 20 mins to get out of bed, she didn&#39;t know if it was lymph nodes swelling or if it was something else. Patient believed that she was having a side effect from dose number one. She has had a persistent pain in her neck/upper back area from the morning after she got the vaccine. She never had neck pain before, so she had been watching it. She said it hurt pretty bad and it&#39;s gotten worse. It was moderate to severe. She was waiting for her doctor to call her back. Patient mentioned that in the information she was given, this side effect wasn&#39;t stated so she was wondering if it was normal or what she should do. Patient also reported that she had read a bunch of threads online about people reporting neck pain after the Pfizer vaccine and some had mentioned lymph node swelling. The patient also reported that on 07Apr2021, with her first COVID 19 vaccine she had this muscle pain on her shoulder, back and neck area on the side where she got the COVID 19 vaccine. It began like a day after she received the COVID 19 vaccine. The pain kept getting worse and by day 7 or 8, after the vaccine, the pain was really bad, and she couldn&#39;t lift her head up when she would wake up in the morning. She tried to contact her primary care doctor but didn&#39;t hear back from that office. Her muscle pain finally started to go away. She spoke to someone at Pfizer  about 2 weeks ago who was going over statistics with her from the clinical study that was done. The patient was told that 21 percent of people experienced new or worsened muscle pain. Nothing else had changed in any other area of her life or any other activity. The only outlier was the COVID 19 vaccine. That&#39;s why she called because it was severe pain. She wanted to go to the emergency department but what was waiting to hear back from her primary care doctor, but that office never got back to her. It was scary, she couldn&#39;t lift her head for a few days, and she took Ibuprofen. Now her second COVID 19 vaccine was scheduled in 2 days on 05May2021. She felt very hesitant about getting the second vaccine. She lived alone and she didn&#39;t want to go through her muscle pain again. She didn&#39;t want her family to have to drive to her house to help her. She was following up with Pfizer to see if there was any guidance on whether someone with her experience should receive her second COVID 19 vaccine. She reported that she called her doctor 2 to 3 times daily for 3 days and never spoke to anyone from that office. By then the weekend was there. On the third day of trying to call her doctor, she left her doctor a crazy voicemail because it was not right that no one was returning her calls and her doctor was unavailable to her. At the time she had a change of work status, so she didn&#39;t have health insurance. She had health insurance now and had not seen a new doctor. Her muscle pain was still lingering. She was been trying to do neck exercises and stretches. She was never had pain in that area before. The patient spoke to a girl who worked at the urgent care. This girl who answered the phone at the urgent care told the patient that the same thing happened to her, it was all neck pain. At that point, the patient was aware that what she experienced had happened to someone else. The patient was trying to confirm if her neck pain was related to the vaccine or not but the girl who answered the phone at the urgent care, didn&#39;t really say anything else. There was not a product complaint to report. There was a medical information request. Further probing could not be done as consumer hung up the call abruptly. Hence, limited information was available over the call. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.  Follow-up# 1 and 2 (03May2021): This is a follow-up spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer (patient) reported for herself included that: added new events (muscle pain on her shoulder and pain was really bad and she couldn&#39;t lift her head up) treatment information, and clinical information.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for herself. A 34-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Apr2021 12:00 at 34 years old (Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Anemia, Depression, Chronic Dry Eye, penicillin allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lifitegrast (XIIDRA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and experienced drug allergy. An hour after the vaccine on 03Apr2021, patient&#39;s fingers were red and swollen (like after exercise on a hot day) and she was itchy all over her body. No symptoms for almost 4 days--then she started feeling intermittently dizzy/lightheaded, feverish every night (chills and hot flashes) for the next 4 nights. She got a wracking cough and was short of breath (couldn&#39;t climb a single flight of stairs without needing to lie down for several minutes). She was also extremely exhausted-- slept 20 hours in a single day. After multiple telemedicine and in-person appointments, a trip to urgent care, and a chest x-ray and CT, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with antibiotics, vitamin D, and two inhalers. She missed her period, had an elevated d-dimer, and her white blood cell count dropped from 7.0 Thousand u/L to 3.6. She was incapacitated for 2 weeks-- the sickest she had ever been in her life. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient performed Nasal Swab, negative on 11Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken for pneumonia. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Vaccine was given Tuesday late afternoon. Friday morning I woke up with a sore and stiff left knee. Saturday morning my knee started to swell and by Saturday afternoon I was unable to walk and my knee was extremely swollen. I went to Urgent Care Sunday and they couldn&#39;t figure out why it was swollen. I visited an orthopedic specialist Monday morning and he sent me to the ER as he thought my knee was infected. Monday I began to also feel sick, weak, lethargic and had brain fog. At the hospital they drained my knee and discovered it was not infected so they sent me home even though I was feeling very unwell, nauseous and achy. Within 24 hours (by Tuesday evening) I developed severe fevers and my knee was extremely swollen and painful. I checked back into the hospital where they eventually discovered I had C diff bacterial infection, but still did not have any answers as to why my knee was severely swollen and painful. They did an x-ray, MRI, tapped it multiple times and did several blood tests.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Apr2021 11:00 as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history.  No COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccine within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included vitamin D; ascorbic acid, zinc citrate (ZINC &#43; VITAMIN C); and minocycline HCL all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 16Apr2021 23:00, 10 days after the first dose, the patient started feeling upper back pain on the left side and body aches. On an unspecified date, over the course of the next few days, the patient had extreme neck pain and headache, as well as joint inflammation in knees and wrists as well as erythema nodosum. The patient went to the urgent care and was told to go to the ER to be evaluated for meningitis. The ER discharged the patient with a diagnosis of muscle aches. Over the course of a few more days, on an unspecified date, the symptoms worsened and patient checked into a different ER and was admitted to the hospital and the infectious disease doctor ran tests and told the patient that this was most likely a vaccine side effect. The patient had numerous tests done in the hospital and everything came back normal except for C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate levels which were high in the hospital, as well as the heart rate. They kept the patient in the hospital for 1 day overnight to monitor while administering dexamethasone and IV fluids which helped relieve the symptoms. The outcome of the events was reported as not recovered. The patient had COVID-19 PCR tests via nasal swab on 19Apr2021 and 22Apr2021 and both with negative result.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on April 6, 2021. My symptoms began 10 days later. It all started with upper back muscle aches, on the same side as the vaccine injection. At first, I thought perhaps I pulled a muscle at a workout class, however after the third day of fatigue, the pain started intensifying throughout my body. My knees, ankles, wrists, back, neck and head started intensely aching and turned to flu-like fatigue and a low-grade fever which rendered me bedridden and unable to sleep or move much.   On 4/21, I checked into urgent care where both my COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were negative, so I was instructed to go to the ER to be evaluated for possible meningitis. At the ER, I mentioned separately to both the doctor and a nurse that I believed my symptoms could be related to the vaccine, but they both promptly dismissed the idea and discharged me with a ?muscle ache.?  For two days I was in relentless pain, which left me basically moaning and crying for hours on end. Several of my previous gymnastics injuries from when I was in my teens had resurfaced. My knee swelled up so badly that I couldn?t walk, my previous fractured wrists started aching, my left foot became inflamed, ankles ached, and a rare skin disease I had when I was 19, erythema nodosum, large painful welts on the legs, also re-emerged.   On 4/23, I saw my primary care doctor who also dismissed the idea of my condition being vaccine-related and misdiagnosed me with a respiratory infection, prescribing muscle relaxers that did nothing to ease the discomfort. Three days later I went back in to see her after my condition worsened and she ran labs and suggested it could be an STD (it was not).   On 4/28, the pain was intolerable, and I checked into a different ER where they admitted me to the hospital, ran labs and kept me overnight because my heart rate was so high. It was at a different hospital where the Infectious Disease doctor, finally diagnosed me with having a severe allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and told me that he had seen other similar cases. I was discharged and put on Dexamethasone.  My steroid dose ended on 5/3, and one day later, I started experiencing violent sickness along with the same arthritic symptoms as before, so I checked back into the ER where my knee was drained because there was worry of infection (it was not infected) and I was put on a longer, tapered course of steroid (prednisone) and referred to a Rheumatologist who ruled out autoimmune diseases and confirmed this was a reaction to the vaccine.  I finished the second round of steroids last week and am experiencing the same symptoms all over again, swelling and inflammation of the knee, severe pain in the right psoas, right toe pain, severe neck aches, and sleepless nights. I wanted to avoid a third round of steroids but couldn&#39;t endure the pain and swelling and it got to the point where I could barely walk or move, so I&#39;m back on a third course for 15 more days. In the meantime, I am seeing a naturopath and a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor in hopes that they can provide more support than what I&#39;ve been given elsewhere and that I can get back to  work and to living a normal life again.

A 34-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: Ej1685), intramuscularly in left arm on 29Dec2021 (at the age of 34-years-old), 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, did not receive other vaccines four weeks prior. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The vaccine was administered at a workplace clinic. On 19Jan2021, the patient had a very sore arm, swollen lymph nodes and felt sick for weeks. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. After the first dose the patient was put in medications (unspecified) to help to prevent the same symptoms with second dose. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/batch number was available.

A 34-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13Apr2021 at 14:30 at age of 34-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis (autoimmune conditions, had the Hashimoto&#39;s since she was around 16, that is when she started getting symptoms), ongoing neurocardiogenic syncope (kind of an autoimmune, started when she was 16). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 23Mar2021 at 14:30 at age of 34-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation, and face got hot and face was swelling on 23Mar2021. None other vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. None other Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. None family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 13Apr2021 at 17: 00 or 17: 30, the patient experienced throat swelling, facial numbness, trouble swallowing, coughing, face got hot, face was swelling, facial tingling, rash on legs and back and arms and really her heart was racing after she got the vaccine. Caller came on the line. She had throat and facial swelling, facial numbness, and a rash on her legs and back and arms. Then, she didn&#39;t know if she has nerve damage or what, she still had tingling in her face where it was originally numb. Caller was just wondering if there was a program in place. She was told to go to the ER because she was having a reaction. The hospital had no way of billing it as a Covid-19 vaccine reaction. After the second dose her face got hot and she took a lot of medication and the facial swelling and hotness went away. Her cheeks were red and hot, she was not sure if it was swelling. Her face was hot and bright red, she doesn&#39;t know why. It kind of seemed puffy, but she was not sure if that was what it was. She had swelling about a week after the second dose her face was swollen and puffy, but she thought it&#39;s gone like the hotness was gone. She thought the tingling in her face was related to that. Her face was tingling and hot and swollen, she thought the tingling was a lasting effect. She didn&#39;t still have swelling in her face and it wasn&#39;t hot. It was in the same area as the tingling. With the second dose she had the hotness and swelling 30 minutes after the vaccine, and it was a kind of a puffy tingling numbness. The hotness and swelling went away a little bit later, about 45 minutes after she had the vaccine. She had trouble swallowing after the second dose. She didn&#39;t know if it was because her throat was swelling. She had autoimmune issues and thyroid problems. She didn&#39;t know if her thyroid was swelling. She didn&#39;t realize she had the rash until a few hours after the second dose of the vaccine. Her throat was swelling after the second dose. She took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) immediately and that helped. She took it right when she started noticing her throat was swelling and it went down some at that point so she didn&#39;t feel like panicking. She went to the ER and they gave her steroids and antihistamines, and it was completely gone after that. She did not have an NDC, lot, or expiration date available for the Benadryl she took. She recovered completely. It went away that same day. She thought the facial numbness after the second dose was a little better. It still felt tingly, but it had gotten a little better. She was not really sure, the numbness and tingling were kind of together and she didn&#39;t know how to describe it. She didn&#39;t want to be dramatic, she thought that people should get the vaccine. Reactions were normal for her. She had trouble swallowing about 30 to 40 minutes after she had the second dose of the vaccine. She was driving and realized she was having trouble swallowing or tightness in her throat area. When she went to the hospital she was still having trouble swallowing and was coughing. She thought the coughing was just from the throat swelling. It got better. She only still had the tingling. They did monitor her heart rate, really her heart was racing after she got the vaccine and did slow down after she got medication. They monitored her heart rate and blood pressure on 13Apr2021, results not provided. She hasn&#39;t had any other bloodwork or anything. The patient went to the hospital close to home and went to the ER but was not admitted. They gave her medications and everything returned to normal. She guesses they wanted her to stay, but she was ready to go home. Once everything resolved she left. She was there for a couple hours in the ER. No arrived physician office. The outcome of events throat swelling, trouble swallowing, coughing, face got hot, face was swelling was recovered on 13Apr2021, of event, rash on legs and back and arms and really her heart was racing after she got the vaccine was recovered on unknown date, of event facial tingling and facial numbness was recovering.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The pain and discomfort were manageable and lasted for about 2 weeks after the first dose. Then I got the second dose. After getting second dose, had fever, muscle and joint pain on second day after second dose. Then the fever and muscle pain went away but joint pain has been progressively getting worse. On day 12 after the second dose the joint pain reached a point of interfering with daily normal activities. Most of the joints have discomfort but the ankles and wrists have the most pain. The symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, discomfort, feel of swolleness, and heaviness.

I also had itchy eyeballs for weeks on and off, joint pain, and fatigue.

I have been to multiple doctors ( general practice, allergists, dermatologist and rheumatologist) I have had 2 ER visits because my lips and face swell at times. No one has any idea on how to treat my condition.  I have been on multiple antihistamines as well as 2 rounds of oral steroids and 2 steroid injections. nothing helps.  I have had multiple blood draws and everything comes back normal other than CRP and ESR are both elevated. I have also had a skin biopsy that showed hives with no vasculitis.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

                                                AS REPORTED BY PATIENT:  Monday 12-28 evening I begun to get chills and body aches, the next morning when waking up I felt like a truck hit me. Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

                                                Three minutes after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer\BioNTech COVID19 vaccine today (time 11:34 am), this vaccine study participant developed swelling of both cheeks and &#34;was able to bite on both cheeks&#34; as well as vague flushing of the cheeks.  She did not immediately report these symptoms but returned to the site of her injection (research study site) and reported the cheek swelling and facial flushing to our study nurse.  She denied  lip/tongue/airway swelling, difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, fever, headache, paresthesias, rapid heart rate, chest pain, or other symptoms at that time.  I am a sub-I for Pfizer\BioNTech vaccine study and authorized an immediate dose of Benadryl 50 mg orally which she received.  I examined her at 12:40 pm and she had a reassuring physical exam as follows:  Constitutional:      Appearance: Normal appearance; well-hydrated and alert; no retractions, tachypnea, nasal flaring, or audible wheezing/breath sounds.  No pallor. HEENT:     Head: Normocephalic and atraumatic.     Nose: Nose normal without visible discharge.    Mouth: Mucous membranes are moist.     Cheeks:  Minimal edema of both cheeks is present; no visible erythema on exam. Eyes:     Conjunctiva/sclera: Conjunctivae normal.     Pupils: Pupils are equally round and symmetric. Cardiovascular:     Rate and Rhythm: Normal rate and regular rhythm, HR 80-90.    Pulses: Normal pulses in left wrist 2&#43;/2&#43;; warm hands. Pulmonary:     Effort: Pulmonary effort is normal; RR 12-14.    Breath sounds: Normal breath sounds.  Abdominal:     General: Abdomen is flat.  Neurological:     Mental Status: She is alert; speech and comprehension are normal. The patient still felt unusual by 2:00 pm and was referred to our Emergency Room for further evaluation.  In our ER, she had the following vital signs and exam findings: BP 140/87  | Pulse 73  | Temp 98.1 °F (36.7 °C)  | Resp 16  | SpO2 100%  Gen: well appearing, no apparent distress, speaking in full sentences, no dysphonia Head: normocephalic, atraumatic, no hematoma Eyes: pupils equal reactive to light, extraocular movements intact ENT: hearing grossly normal, oral mucosa moist without edema/angioedema Resp: speaking in full sentences, clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rubs/crackles/wheeze, normal effort Abd: normoactive bowel sounds, nontender nondistended, no rebound/guarding, no organomegaly, faint/resolving urticaria abd x2 Ext: no deformities, no joint swelling, no edema, faint patchy erythema bilateral upper arms Neuro: alert, nonfocal Psych: AAOX3, normal affect/mood   I walked to our emergency room and reexamined her, and the only new finding were some pink small nonraised popular lesions on her abdomen and proximal arms, but she had no urticaria.  Her lungs remained CTA and she was otherwise as before.  The emergency room only gave famotidine 20 mg to her and discharged her with an EpiPen to use at home (they specifically felt she did not need it in the ER), but gave her oral cetirizine 10 mg to take daily for the next few days.  I asked her how she felt upon discharge from the ER and she felt fine/normal.

Patient described a sensation of warmth and also later tingling in her throat which was treated aggressively with medication for this problem so as to prevent airway closure or further worsening symptoms.  Patient was treated with IV fluid hydration along with H1 and H2 blockers, IV steroids and also subcutaneous epinephrine.  On my reevaluation, her symptoms completely resolved with treatment.  She was without other concerning findings on examination or by history and was without further angioedema or anaphylaxis after period of observation.  She was discharged with prescription medication in good condition and asked to return should she have any further problems.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Axillary lymph node is larger than a marble currently.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP with the above complaints who referred me to employee health.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

The following day (01/23) I felt tired throughout the day. I went to work and when I got home my whole body began to ache (especially my legs) and my lymph nodes were swollen again. This morning (01/24) I woke up physically feeling warm but I was heat seeking and had a fever of 100.8F and was dizzy. Currently my temperature is 98.6 and aside from a mild headache and a very sore left arm/axillary area I feel better.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

                                                On Saturday, January 23, 2021 I woke up around 5:30 in the morning with itchy hands and feet, after my second dose/ Just as I did with my first dose- Which subsided with Benadryl. However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

                                                I am a 35yo G2P1, was 29 weeks pregnant at the time of vaccination (due 3/25/21), completely normal pregnancy so far. CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

I should have gone to the hospital but I have an extreme medical phobia so I stayed up and made sure my tounge didn&#39;t swell any further.  The next morning my tounge was normal ish, the red rash was gone and my hands and wrists were back to normal.  5 days later and I am still experiencing headaches, my throat feels sore and a little bit of a hard time swallowing, extreme exhaustion, dizziness, nausea, a feeling of being completely out of it, otherworldly.

Second night I had ongoing fever, chills, muscle pain, fatigue and overall feeling under the weather.  7 days after I had right leg pain from thigh to ankle.  Till today I still have generalized fatigue and swollen lymph nodes (although they are smaller that before)

                                                I got the shot on a Friday night at 5pm. I experience the arm pain in my left arm through out the top of my arm , by the end of  that night. By Saturday evening most of the pain was gone from that site. Late Saturday night I started noticing some pain in the arm pit on the left arm, didn&#39;t think much about it. By Sunday mid morning the pain was just getting more severe. Started to pay close attention to the side effects of the vaccine to realize that I most likely had swollen lymph nodes. The pain continued through the following Wednesday, when the pain started to not be as bad. I still to this day have some pain in the lymph nodes. I have contacted my doctor and was told to just monitor the site to make sure nothing is worse. That these reactions are common. I also have some soreness in my upper arm under where the shot was given, that I&#39;m not sure if it is from the shot or the muscle compensating from the soreness of the swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wed night 1/31/21 at 5:50pm. I had no prior recent illnesses prior to getting the shot. About 24 hours later, developed fevers/chills, body aches, headaches, and fatigue, and a notable pain in the front of neck -- felt like tender thyroid. Temp was 100.3F on Thursday night 1/14. Took ibuprofen and went to bed. Next day felt fine, went to work, but symptoms returned on Friday night without fever. Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.

                                                The evening following administration of the second COVID-19 vaccine, I experienced pain in my left armpit and noticed a large amount of swelling in the lymph node area. Unaware this could be related to the vaccine, I made an appointment with urgent care. The pain was mostly gone the next day and was only experienced when pressure was placed in the area of swelling. I was seen the following day (1/13/21) and it was noted that the swelling was not attributed to an infection and I was sent to the breast imaging center to rule out a breast cancer diagnosis. At this visit it was ruled not to be cancer and was potentially attributed to the vaccine. I still have the englared armpit/lymph area, but no pain.

The itching continues now, 6 days later, but 4 days  after vaccine (2 days ago), the itching was compounded with pain (same area as itching) and lumps (some at the base of right breast, others even into right armpit). They are not visibly red nor are they warm to the touch, but I can feel them under the skin, unlike the same area on the left breast.

I felt joint pain in my body but mostly my finger joints and wrist.  Left hand strength had become weak and couldn&#39;t put any weight in it or grip. After 12 hrs the swollen feeling went away.  The next day I noticed my index finger on left hand was very swollen but my hand didn&#39;t feel swollen like the day before.  2 days later I noticed my middle finger on the left hand was swollen. After 12 hours, the swelling is gone.  The next week I notice my middle finger on the right hand was swollen.  My hands are unable to make a fist when swollen feeling.  Now both of my hands are swollen.  A hot shower helps and sometime Motrin.

Unable to grasp and tighten fist with grip weakness. Only on that hand and that specific knuckle. Treated with Tylenol 1000 mg, ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg, and benadryl 25 mg, and zyrtec 10 mg for 3 to 4 days after symptom onset. Returned to normal function in about 10 days. After second dose of Pfizer symptoms did not really develop immediately but noticed 3 weeks after symptoms returned. The symptoms seem to come and go and do not know if they have fully resolved yet.

                                                3 days after the first dose was received, rashes developed under my chin and necks area with itching, and stinging sensation.  The symptoms went away a couple days later.  The same symptoms would appear a couple more times spacing out about 2- 3 weeks after the initial reaction.  Then on 2/17/2021, the same symptoms appear again but this time it would spread out to my entire neck and also my face. Symptoms included facial swelling, redness, blisters, along with stinging, burning, and itching sensation.  I did not crossed my mind that it was a reaction, but come to think of it, all of these happened after the vaccinations.  I did seek medical treatment on 2/18/21 and was treated with steroid pack. Although the medication treatment regime had completed, I still have symptoms of itchiness under my chin and neck as well as the rashes are still visible.

On 2/27/21 there was a noticeable red patch on the eyelid with small scaly looking spots, I assumed it to be a patch of dry skin. There was a 30 minute period of intense tingling pain and shooting/stabbing intermittent pain. There was also some numbness later on that day. Also on 2/27/21 I noticed a large lymphnode swelling on my jawline adjacent to my left ear. On 3/1/21 I saw my primary care provider and was diagnosed with shingles. After reviewing the preliminary symptoms of shingles, I had been experiencing abnormal fatigue and stomach upset for about 5 days prior to the eruption.

After the 2nd dose I had a low fever, fatigue, severe body aches - specifically in my joints, chills and nausea for the first 24 hours. Then I developed swollen lymph nodes under my left arm which I still have over 48 hours after the vaccination. I am also still fatigued over 48 hours after the vaccination.

                                                Before going to bed the day of vaccine, I noticed my left shoulder/collarbone area was hurting and did not sleep well that night even though I was tired. When I woke up the next day, I was in some discomfort around my collarbone and felts a small lump. I waited until Wednesday and did a virtual visit with a doctor and they said it is probably the lymph nodes. There has been no change in the size of the lump nor has it moved to a new spot.

                                                It did not manifest in a normal way- I started coughing and needed my inhaler, proceeded to feel as if my legs were covered in fire ant bites and swollen, the skin all over my body itched to the point that I broke the skin, my face became bright red and hivey, and my throat began to tighten as if someone were choking me. The only reason I did not use my Epipen was the fact that I could still breathe through this, even if it was a bit labored. I should add that my reaction began 1.5 hours after I was vaccinated. I?ve been managing having life threatening allergies since I was a child, but this reaction resembled nothing I?ve ever experienced.  After using 50 mg of Benadryl, my symptoms were manageable. The pain at the injection site lasted for five days and caused intermittent numbness to my pinky finger and up my neck.

These lasted for about 24 hours from onset of symptoms which began 12 hours after receiving my vaccine. The lymph nodes under the arm of my injection site were also swollen and painful to the touch or pressure such as sleeping on my side. I also had very unusual and vivid dreams the night of my shot which I am still able to recall days later.

                                                I got a very swollen armpit 2 days after my second Pfizer vaccine.  I have had this problem to this day (4/14/2021).  Sometimes the swelling goes down, but it continues to return once again.  I did get pregnant very soon after my second vaccination; wondering if the mammary changes in pregnancy could be prolonging the reaction?  My due date is Oct 19.  My OB is unsure what to do about the armpit swelling.  If you have any advice, I&#39;d love to hear it.  It does worry me.

                                                I started ovulating on the same day I received the second dose, 3/27/21.  On second night of the second dose, 3/28/21, I had swollen lymph nodes in left armpit, and experienced a tightness/heaviness in the chest. I had to sleep upright to get some sort of relief. The sensation would come and go throughout the coming days.   On 3/30/21, I was still experiencing the aforementioned symptoms, but was also now feeling dull pain in solar plexus and back (4 on a scale of 10). I took Tylenol.  On 4/5/21, I went to see my primary care physician. I had an EKG done, the results were 56 BPM, EKG Severity was borderline abnormal.  I never had a fever, diarrhea, chills. I only experienced left shoulder pain at the injection site, fatigue and a slight headache (which I expected).   Since then, the aforementioned symptoms have subsided, but I now experience tingling, numbness and a faint dull pain (1 or 2 on a scale of 10) in the left arm on the inside near my elbow?especially during night when I?m trying to sleep.

                                                The next evening following the vaccine, my right eye swelled (the white of the eye) and my cheek and above my eyebrow became inflamed on the right side only. I visited the ER the next morning and they told me it looked like an unrelated allergic reaction. She said it looked almost like the pattern of shingles but said that was unlikely. Visited another dr who said it looked like the possible beginnings of shingles based on the affected areas and that I should monitor. Face feels hot, eye swelling went away after Benadryl use the first night but cheek and eyebrow are still inflamed.

This consumer reported events for mother (self) and child. This is the maternal report.   A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Apr2021 12:15, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a drug store.

The patient did not received other vaccines in four weeks. On 07Apr2021 at 03:00, the patient went to the bathroom and felt fine. She sat on the toilet and all of a sudden felt dizzy and nauseous. Next thing she knew, she woke up on the floor and had a huge bump on her head near her left eye. She passed out and hit her head on the tile in the bathroom. Her left eye was half swollen shut, her eyelid and under eye were black, was very swollen all over her head and eye and was in lots of pain. She went to the emergency room around 04:30. All tests, CT scan and blood work came back normal. She was told that it was most likely caused by the vaccine. Treatment for the events included &#34;CT scan, bloodwork, IV fluids&#34; (as reported). She was hoping that Pfizer will pay for her ER visit since the events were vaccine reactions. She reported that she was still in lots of pain and was not taking pain meds because she was breastfeeding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician office visits. The outcome of pain was not recovered. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021442302 Baby case

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 35-year-old non-pregnant female received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 at 16:45 (at 35-year-old age) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products or any other medical history. No concomitant medications were reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, patient has been tested for COVID-19. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, patient experienced strong neck pain in the area-on the left side (vaccine was injected in left arm). Two days after experiencing strong neck pain, on 30Jan2021, at 12:00PM, on day 5 after vaccination with 1st dose, patient developed swelling of the left supraclavicular lymph node (3-4 cm in diameter). Possibly also swelling of groin lymph nodes but more minor. On an unspecified date in 2021, swelling in supraclavicular lymph node was not subsiding by day 8-9 after vaccination and was significantly painful. Reporter considered events as non-serious. Due to the events, patient visited doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. On 25Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and 29Jan2021, patient underwent lab test of COVID-PCR via nasal swab and tested negative. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the adverse event. Outcome of the events were not resolved.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Injection received at 0815. At 0900 I started getting diaphoretic, clammy, nauseas and my face was flushed. At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

Flushing of hands; Dizziness; Fatigue; Legs became heavy; Joint stiffness of hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ 1685), intramuscular on the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 AM in a hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies of seasonal allergies, cats, and metals; migraines, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and angioedema. The patient was not pregnant and did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination and did not test positive to COVID post vaccination (also reported as not been tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination). Concomitant medication included propranolol, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), and sertraline (reported as other medications in two weeks). On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID 19, brand: Pfizer) lot no: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had no relevant medical history and no known allergies. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination, last menstrual date was on 05Oct2020, delivery date will be on 12Jun2021, gestation period: 11.  Concomitant medication includes daily multivitamin. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 30Dec2020 04:00 am, 7 days after vaccine (as reported), a large mass appeared in right axilla. The mass was painful to touch. Overnight mass more than doubled in size on 31Dec2020 the mass took up her entire arm pit, went to immediate care and was given antibiotics. The mass decreased in size but has not gone away. She followed up with primary care. She had bloodwork and ultrasound of axilla and right breast. Blood work was normal. Ultrasound showed a few enlarged and abnormal lymph nodes believed to be reactive in nature. Largest lymph node as of 08Dec2020 2.5 x 0.9 x 2.2 cm. The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Later in the evening I had the same feeling in my left leg and in my cheeks, lips, tongue and teeth. I felt like I had been numbed at the dentist, but was coming out of the numbness. It was like when the numbness is mostly gone and you&#39;re left with that tingling sensation, and your face feels puffy. It was basically that feeling in my face, left leg, and left arm. Those sensations are mostly gone today (the second day following), but not quite.

A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 11Jan2021 15:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chronic allergies, gastritis, and walnut allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), metformin, loratadine (CLARITINE), spironolactone, and calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000).

The patient verbalized, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related but I figured I should report just in case. I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine. 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough. By sudden onset, I mean I had no desire to cough and over about 30 min I developed the severe need to cough. My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks. I&#39;ve never experienced such a violent cough with so much sudden sputum production. I am using an Albuterol inhalor to help chest tightness.&#34; Clinical outcome of chest discomfort was unknown while for the other events was not recovered.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

However at 7pm I could feel something strange spreading across my face.  My left side of my face became numb and swollen.  I went to urgent care the next day and they said I had inflammation in my facial nerve and prescribed me prednisone.  I&#39;ll be on the prednisone for another 8 days, tapering.  My face and head have continued to be numb and swollen.  Today for the first time, it feels a little better.  Today is a week since I received the vaccine.

Around 1:45pm my throat started swelling and I was having trouble swallowing. This continued to get worse, so I stopped at the ER on my way home. I was given Benadryl in an IV and observed for 2 hours. The swelling in my throat went down by 2:45, but the itchiness continued until around 5pm. That evening, the only symptom left was fatigue.

She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room.

They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck.

The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name).

                                                Hello! I got my second covid vaccine on Wednesday (Pfizer) and I believe I maybe experiencing a side effect. My lymph nodes in my arm pit (under the arm of the shot) are swollen and tender to the touch.   On Thursday night (11th and 24 hours after receiving the shot) I had the chills and a low grade fever(100.4). I took ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke up this morning (the 12th) with a swollen underarm but no chills or fever.   The swolling in my underarm as gotten larger and is getting ?more? tender. The swelling is larger than this morning. I have taken ibuprofen with no relief.   Is there anything I should do or now. I have been researching side effects and it appears to be common.... in women....?   Thank you for your time.

                                                Shot scheduled time was 8:35 AM.  I had symptoms of swelling in my throat and lymph nodes, only on the left side, after the Pfizer vaccination was given. It occurred 5 minutes after injection. At 7 minutes after my vaccination,  I approached EMS to report my symptoms to EMS. EMS did an exam and said my lymnode on my left side was a little swollen. Pharmacist took my name and number for contact information. Benadryl (25 mg) was given to me from the Giant Eagle Pharmacist  after seeing EMS at 8:55 AM. Waited an additional 30 minutes with EMS to monitor symptoms. Symptoms decreased in severity after Benadryl  (25 mg) was given.  ?Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;

I have the feeling in my cheeks like you were about to eat a lemon or lime were thinking about eating it the little tingling feeling but it was that times like 10. Went to the ER in And they gave me antibiotics and told me to eat a bunch of lemons or lemon drops and drink water. At first I didn?t even think it would be a reaction because it was three days later but the emergency doctor believes it was from the shot.

                                                I have a large lump (axillary area)  in the armpit of my left arm which is the injection arm. I noticed it roughly two days after the 2nd injection. It was non painful at first, but now it is tender. It is roughly the size of an egg/golf ball. I also have tenderness on my chest  above my right breast but on the pectoralis muscle. Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

This has been occurring since after receiving the first vaccine, with increased severity after the second.  The symptoms last from 20-2 hours after exposure and then resolve.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

                                                On the 9th night post 1st dose of vaccine, my right hand started feeling itchy and I noticed small hives by my thumb area. Later in the middle of the night, I got them on both palms and they were both itchy, though tolerable. By next morning, 10th day post vaccine, I had noticeable hives on both hands. They were itchy but manageable. I put some OTC hydrocortisone cream on both hands and that helped. By the next day, they were still there but not getting worse. Some hives were located on inner fingers, which made them swell. By the 3rd day of hives, they were subsiding and not worse. I did start feeling a bit of it on my feet, very minimal - maybe 2 or so per foot.

On day 4, had extreme fatigue, aches, chills, with a &#34;puffy-flushed face and neck sensation,&#34; which later in the evening, developed a full body rash resembling hives. Went to ER and took prednisone 50mg, Benadryl 50mg, and famotidine 40mg. On day 5, the rash had progressed in color (brighter red) from head down to my ankles. Had a doctor tell me it was a maculopapular rash which was blanchable on my abdomen/back. My legs were covered down to my ankles with red dots that became purple non-blanchable small bruises the next day (day 6), resembling petechiae.

                                                3/30 - Vaccine around 11am. Started feeling shortness of breath, sensation of throat tightening and a flat hive with red outline appeared on my neck around 2:30. Subjectively felt feverish, only 99.6 with chills. Around 3, hands turned purple, lips turned white and I felt like I was going to pass out. Took some Benadryl and saw improvement within 20 minutes. Husband monitored for a few hours afterwards, still felt a little off but didn&#39;t get worse and saw gradual improvement, started being itchy all over. 3/31 - Extremely tired, sore arm, puffy face, extremely itchy.

                                                I first experienced fatigue for the two following days after the vaccine. On the third day, I woke up with a rash on the same of my face. This rash got worse over the following days -- my face burned as though fire aunts had bitten me all over. At first, it was red and swollen, then the hives began to become visible on the 6th day, The rash and hives are around the nose and inner yes, and the side of the forehead near the temple These areas are swollen, Hives are also on the checks and forehead. The face, when dry, is itchy and when wet has a burning sensation. Sweat, washing face and applying facial products (even gentle ones) yield unbearable burning sensation.  One week after the vaccine, I was prescribed hydrocortisone Cream USP 2.5% but when applying, my face burned. Thermal water, on the other hand soothed the skin and calmed the burning sensation. On day 7, at night, I tried applying cicapalst. My skin did not react this time. On day 8, I tried the hydrocortisone again, but it still burned. SO, I applied the cicaplast again and thermal water to soother the skin. In the evening of day 8, I was able to apply the hydrocortisone cream over the skin which had been treated with cicaplast first. There was a stinging sensation (thought, this time, not burning) which was soothed with thermal water. My face is still itchy and swollen.

Went to urgent care and was told my lymph nodes were very swollen there. Now experiencing swollen lymph nodes on my left arm and possibly leg. Trying to get in to see my primary care doctor, but I have not seen her yet.

                                                ~2 hours post-injection sharp pain in upper left abdomen under rib cage when breathing in but not constantly. Just every now and then. This lasted for ~72 hours.  ~12 hours post-injection developed a mild fever, chills, body aches, and head ache. Body aches became so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep, sit, stand, lay down comfortably. Every joint in my body felt like glass shards in it and it felt like my body would crumble. I felt like the TinMan with no oil. This lasted for about 28 course post-injection. Fever lasted about 48 hours, and headache lasted about 72 hours.  ~36 hours post-injection I had a swollen lymph node on my left collarbone (shot was given in left arm). I&#39;m now ~96 hours post-injection and swelling has not come down. From my left collar bone to my left elbow there is dull aching soreness, and in my armpit too. I have weakness in my left arm and when I try to reach for anything it feels like my armpit is going to rip. I hope this goes away soon.

                                                Three hours after the vaccine until ten days after the shot. I felt pain from the middle of my back on up to my neck. It was like whip lash. I did have an injury from a car accident about ten years ago. I had muscle pain around my shoulder area and my whole upper back 11pm the night of the shot I had a fever. I still had joint pain but I had to leave work with a headache joint pain and a low grade fever. After two days the headaches were less severe. I had joint pain that was mainly in my hands like arthritis all the way down to my fingers. My fingers were also swollen. Tylenol seemed to keep the pain under control. This lasted for ten days after it slowly went away.

Benadryl 50mg was administered with good results. About an hour after the Benadryl was administered my face and extremities began to feel numb and tingly and my tongue felt thick (I couldn&#39;t talk clearly) and my face began to swell. I was then taken to the medical office across the street for additional treatment. My vitals were taken and my blood pressure was elevated, I was taken to a room and Benadryl and a steroid was administered SubQ and I was prescribed an oral steroid  as well.  I continued to have swelling and numbness for five days and I had to take Benadryl every four hours for those five days.

                                                My arm started swelling that night, 04/21. It was painful to move or brush against anything. The next morning 04/22, I couldn?t move my arm without extreme pain, it hurt to even change into my work clothes(I work from home), I had a fever, shaking chills, fatigue, and a head ache that didn?t stop until about 8p. I logged off from work about 645p. I went to shower and noted a new quarter sized rash that was at the injection site with a white dot near the center. Today 04/23, no fever or chills but headache and fatigue persisted. Tonight 04/23, rash is now the size of a baseball, there is a marble size lump underneath my skin and the rash is pink and even in color, the white dot at injection site is still there, it?s been itchy today but I haven?t touched it.  I am healthy, have zero existing medical conditions and confused on my body?s reaction to my initial vaccination.  I am 5?3? and 118 lb. I take nothing but birth control. I get sick maybe once every couple years, nothing major, just based on cold/flu season. I get my flu shot annually. My lymph nodes are normal, no swelling anywhere else, no other side effects.

A 36-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EW0158), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 26Apr2021 14:45 (at the age of 36-years-old) as 2 nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was a hospital. The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot no: ER8729) on 05Apr2021 at 14:45 in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced cytomegalovirus (CMV). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since vaccination, patient was not tested for COVID-19. Medical history included CMV; HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia, all when she delivered her son 3 weeks early and pregnant. Concomitant medications included ferrous sulfate; amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and unspecified prenatal vitamins. The patient reported 3 rd time CMV has reactivated in 2021. After 2nd vaccine dose (on 26Apr2021), soreness at shot site and joint pain. Late that night, chills, 104.0 fever. Next day (on 27Apr2021), 103 fever took paracetamol (TYLENOL) 4-6 hrs. Third day after (on 29Apr2021), 103 fever, still joint pain, &amp; preeclampsia level migraines. Still had Rx migraine meds but couldn&#39;t mix with fever reducer. So took leftover oxycodone from having a baby at midnight and 05:00. Next day/4th post shot day (30Apr2021), severe migraine, fever staying around 100.something. So the patient took migraine medicine, melatonin (3 mg a few times that night). The melatonin was kinda helpful. In 2021, the patient was itchy all over for a few nights (been in anafalactic shock 3x prior so the patient knew it wasn&#39;t that) joint pain, now she have a weird lump in her armpit by her breast that hasn&#39;t gone away. Almost woke her husband to go to hospital because of migraine. The case was considered non-serious as did not result in death, non-life threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating and no congenital anomaly/birth defect. The outcome of the event axillary mass was not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021509886 baby case

Two weeks later I then got a weird rash on the left side of my face. It was very painful and it started on my forehead to the left . It started to travel down my face and into my eye. I had a Telehealth visit and they said it was just a random rash. I then saw my PCP and they advised that I had the Shingles. I still have scars on my face especially on my forehead. I was prescribed anti-viral medication for ten days which was extended for five days and the rash started to improve within three days. I had the Chicken Pox as a child.

                                                I got a severe fever, chills, and body aches (so badly I couldn&#39;t move) 24 hours after having received the 1st dose. Then my lymph swelled up for 3 days. From my collar bone to my shoulder blade and under my arm, it was extremely swollen and painful. I thought I had a rib out! When the swelling subsided (day 4 or 5), my heart started fluttering, palpitating, and I felt extreme anxiety.  I also felt achy in my entire body for the following month. Pain in all my joints. A LOT of inflammation. I was worried.  I got a dr. appt and had an EKG.  Nothing was found and nothing was suggested. Upon seeing a second doctor, he suggested I take aspirin. This has helped A TON! I am still having a lot of heart fluttering. This is NOT NORMAL it happened within a week of getting the shot and it is scary.

On 4/29/21 I started having pain and burning sensation under my right armpit radiating to my breast area. I contacted my doctor she said it was probably my lymph nodes that were swollen. On 5/10/21 I started having pain on my right leg and some swelling. I went to the urgent care on 5/11/21 they told me to watch out for shingles. I wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t a blood clot. On 5/12/21 I started having abdominal pain on my right side, I went to the Urgent care and they did a CT scan showing my small intestine and appendix inflamed. I was transferred to the Emergency room and admitted the same day. I had an appendectomy on 5/15/21. I went for my second dose on 5/21/21 I went to do blood work on 5/27/21 and I received a call from my doctors office that my Liver Enzymes were super high.

                                                I got the vaccine at 9 a.m. and I started feeling very tired at some point in the afternoon. I was feeling a little bit odd and mostly just tired. We sit down to dinner at 6:30 or 7 and I started getting these weird 8 sort of radiating down my legs almost like achy knee pain. I had the urge to have a bowel movement, which appeared to be a normal bowel movement. I started feeling progressively worse. I was just achy, fatigue, and it was just kind of hard to do things and move around. I breastfed my daughter. I guess I should mention that with both of the vaccinations, this being my think it, my breasts got very engorged and painful. I am 7 months postpartum and never have engorgement or pain in my breasts. But for two days after the vaccine I had engorged painful let down both times. I was feeding her and just ceiling off. I got up hoping I would have the energy to put some groceries away and then I wanted to take a bath because I thought it would make me feel better. I walk to the kitchen and my knees and legs just felt so weird and achy. My entire body started shaking and trembling uncontrollably. I really couldn&#39;t move very well and all of my muscles were tensing up. So I just went down to the floor and tried to stay in a fetal position. While this was happening I was getting really cold. At some point my teeth started chattering and my muscles were tensing up, especially the muscles in my neck and jaw and shoulders. They hurt so bad and felt like they were just tightening beyond control. My arms and hands felt very very cold. My lower back especially along my spine was hurting really badly and my knees and other joints were hurting. I stayed on the ground until my husband, who was putting our daughter to bed, came out and helped me get to the bathtub. He actually thought we should call 911, but I wanted to try hot water to see if I could get my muscles to unclench. I sat in hot bath and the shaking stopped but I started feeling like my head was boiling. My husband helped me get out of the tub and dressed and pretty much right when I got out of the tub I started feeling really cold again and the shaking started again. I got in bed under lots of layers and was still very cold and shaking. My head felt very hot but the rest of me felt very cold. I had a lot of trouble sleeping and kept alternating between feeling like I was on fire and then my body would be really cold but my head would be really hot. I just felt really achy and feverish. At one point I felt pretty dizzy. So I just held still as much as I could. At another point I got what felt like really severe period cramps on my left side. I changed positions and they did go away. I felt nauseated the next morning and have no appetite. I made myself eat some saltine crackers and have a coconut water. I felt still like I had a flu or something but the headache was the worst part. I have never had a headache that bad it felt like my entire skull was cracking open. And pretty much the first half of the day after the vaccine I felt like I had just been hit by a truck. I ended up taking ibuprofen midday because of the headache and the joint pain that I was experiencing mostly in my knees and started feeling significantly better. It has been 2 days after the vaccine and I pretty much feel normal except my lower back feels swollen on the left side. The night when all of this was happening my lower back was hurting pretty badly as well along with my other joints, specifically my knees.

                                                Covid toes, red tender slightly swollen toes with mild purple discoloration at the tip of toes, developed 3 days after receiving the first vaccine dosage in the series.  I have tested negative for covid as of 1/10/21.  It was initially thought that I had a skin infection from clipping my nails too short and was prescribed doxyclycline. I saw an improvement within a few days on the antibiotic but them saw a reappearance of the covid toes presenting symptoms on 1/8/21. I have since been told by a physician that I likely have covid toes and not a bacterial infection. I was told to take baby asprin and that is helping to reduce the symptoms.   In the past few weeks I have had no symptoms of Covid besides the appearance of covid toes. I understand that covid toes are often a latent symptom and that the timing of the appearance of this symptom could be coincidental. I am mildly concerned that the first vaccine dosage could have caused a flair up of a potential previous covid infection or could have caused the red covid toes symptom itself.

A 37-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 19Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included celiac, anxiety depression, ADHD, cold sores sometimes, secondary infertility, seasonal allergies, sulfa allergy. Concomitant medication included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), metformin, ibuprofen, pyridoxine hydrochloride (B6) and folic acid. Previously the patient experienced allergies: hydrocodone, naproxen. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 28Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization (lot number: EL1284, left arm). After her 2nd vaccine (20Jan2021) she felt achy and had chills, no fever that was expected. Then the second day after her vaccine on 21Jan2021 12:00 AM, she woke up with her left armpit hurting and lymph nodes swollen on her left breast. Then on my third day (22Jan2021) she woke up and still had the left armpit pain and swelling and now she was getting intermittent sharp zapping pains on her left side of her external Obliques. She could not find anything online about the armpit pain and swelling and the Obliques pain. She was a nurse also and just wanted reassurance her that this was normal she was gonna get better. No treatment was received for the events. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Events were reported as non-serious. Patient was not pregnant. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Left arm became very sore after about 8 hours after each dose. After the 2nd day after each injection, a wave of exhaustion hit me. About 10 days after the first injection, I felt a tingling in my lip and a cold sore erupted. Then another! I&#39;ve never had 2 at the same time. One on the top lip and one on the bottom. I haven&#39;t had a cold sore in 15 years. I had my 2nd titer on February 3rd. On February 15th I had another eruption of another cold sore.  I didn&#39;t think the first recurrence of a cold sore was linked to the vaccine, but the timing of the 2nd one is beyond coincidental, which is why I&#39;m reporting it. Abreva is not helping too much. I haven&#39;t had a herpes breakout since 2006.

I also had swelling in my fingers really bad on the same hand of the arm I got the vaccine.  Other side effects were headache, body aches, and a little bit of chills but those were expected.  I reached out to my PCP and she said to just monitor it to make sure it goes down in the next few days which I plan to do.

                                                Day of vaccine (Tues 3/9): Mild headache, injection site soreness.  I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s related, but I couldn&#39;t really focus on work-related tasks - I don&#39;t know if it was just the nervousness of waiting for side effects or what.  Day after vaccine (Wed 3/10): Mild headache that came and went through the day (I took acetaminophen in the early evening), tiredness, injection site soreness (noticed bruise forming), and felt &#34;off&#34; - not quite nauseated, but not normal self.  Same lack of focus/productivity.  Two days after vaccine (Thur 3/11): No headache, injection site soreness waning (but bruise is bigger), not as tired, better focus, but in the evening, I felt a hard rounded node above my collarbone (about two fingers wide).  Freaked out, Googled it, saw swollen lymph nodes on side of vaccine site is somewhat typical.  Appears to be my left supraclavicular lymph node and if you look hard enough, you can visibly see the left side is slightly swollen.  I cannot feel any other swollen lymph nodes.  Today (Fri 3/12):  Bruised injection site, and this swollen, hard lymph node is quite sore.  Other than that, I feel fine at the moment.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination the entire left hand side of my face went numb as if I&#39;d had a dental procedure (I was injected on the left side). The nurses on site looked me over and said I was ok to go home at the end of my wait time.  The effect faded as the day went on and was gone the next morning. I was vaccinated on a Tuesday morning and on the following Thursday morning I woke up with swelling covering almost my entire bicep area on the side I was vaccinated. The area is about 8 inches by 4 inches. It is swollen, red, hard to the touch, painful and mildly itchy.  As of today (Friday) it has gotten a couple of inches bigger and not improved at all.

About  01:00, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain. I had hives all over me. Hives were spreading all over my body: hair; arm with the injection; we called 9-1-1 I went to the hospital. They gave me some meds through IV. By that time, I had taken Bendryl and I was there about 4 hours with IV. I felt better but hives didn&#39;t subside. That Sunday afternoon they started getting worse again and I went back to the hospital  (16th)and they gave me rounds of something through IV.  On 17th, I went back to hospital - they gave me another shot for the hives. I worked on the 18th - but was they said I should go home because I didn&#39;t look well. My lip started swelling that night. On the 19th, I went to my doctor and the Dr, used an epi-pen on me and gave me a shot of something for the  welts still on my body. They still didn&#39;t go away.  Symptoms have calmed down - but I still have spots on me. I am on Prilosec and anti-itch - Atarax and some others.

As soon as I got the shot I could feel a degranulation and tightening in my throat, but I did not need to use my epi-pen. I did use my inhaler. After about 15 minutes the allergic reaction subsided, and after 30 minutes I felt well enough to go home.

Symptoms subsided 30 hours after onset except for the lymph node swelling. 72 hours after receiving  vaccine left lymph node at clavicle became hard and came to the skin surface. It is about the size of a large pea. The swelling around the area slowly increased over the next few. The node is painful and the swollen area is tender. The tenderness spread down my chest and out toward my should. The total area of tenderness is about 4 inches in diameter. The status is the same today.

                                                After a few minutes, I started to feel chest pains which started to intensify, then my breathing started to get shallow. Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back. They&#39;re happening now as I write this

                                                about 12-13 hours after the vaccine, I developed chills and a fever. The fever went up to about 102.4 and lasted 4-5 hours. By the morning next day (24 hours after the vaccine), the fever was down to between 99-100. I had a horrible pounding headache during all this time. I took ibuprofen for the first time about 24 hours after the vaccine. I was exhausted for the next 24 hours but the fever was minimal. I did develop swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit (with occasional sharp pain), along the lateral side of my left breast (with occasional sharp pain) and along my neck on the left side (painfree). Those enlarged nodes lasted for a little over a week. I still occasionally get pain in my left armpit/breast but I think some of that may be from my DJD in my neck (I have severe stenosis and hemichord compression on the left side).

After a couple minutes, the patient was lightheaded and dizzy. After two minutes the patient became unconscious, was not breathing, and was turning purple/blue. She then began having a seizure and was placed on to the ground. One dose of EpiPen was given to her and she regained consciousness.

                                                Left eye is swollen. Puffiness is around the whole eye socket, but more so below the eye. No pain, but it feels as swollen as it looks. I?ve taken one Aleve, two allergy pills (the Walgreens version of Allegra) , and used a cold eye compress. It is still swollen as of 7:47 pm ET. It has not improved that much, but it has not gotten worse. I don?t know if this swelling is due to the vaccine, as my arm feels sore but okay, or possibly a poorly timed mosquito bite in the middle of the night (as there was one in my room last night).

I?m also having some nerve pain in the arm that was previously injured (left arm) and it?s falling asleep at night and worsening of that arm pain/weakness even though I?ve been resting it for two weeks. I?m also having scalp pain at the hair roots at the top of my head. My breasts are also very sore and enlarged, with lumps in my right breast which started after my first dose but have been progressively worse. I haven?t gotten my period, it?s over 40 days late.

The arm got progressively more sore over the next 18-24 hours. A penny-sized bruise appeared at the site of injection about 18 hours post-injection. No medication was taken for the arm soreness or  bruising. Excessive tiredness also occurred about 20-22 hours post-injection, resulting in a heavy sleep for two hours mid-day on 13 April 2021 but patient continued to feel tired. On 14 April 2021, patient awoke with swollen lymph glands in the neck area and tenderness in the back of the throat when she swallowed. At about 34-36 hours post injection, the patient again experienced excessive tiredness and new adverse events of mild headache, muscle aches throughout the body, and aches in the ankle and hip joints. At this point, patient took two tablets of 200-mg ibuprofen along with water, coconut water, and hot tea to stay hydrated. At this point, patient reported these adverse events but has not yet recovered.

Then the second day, early in the morning,  it may have been the night before, a rash started to form on my left lower leg/ ankle and my foot and ankle started to well.  I am still suffering with this too this day but now it&#39;s both legs,  ankles, and feet. It does seem to be getting better, the rash is lessening and the swelling is going down.

The swelling is about the size of a golf ball and is very painful to the touch and when not touched at all. It is now 4 full days after the injection and this symptom has not subsided.

I also had a fever, muscle and joint aches, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes in my neck and armpit that second day. The third and fourth day the migraine turned into a headache for both days. I then got a 2 day break of no migraine or headache (day 5 and 6). Then day 7, I got another headache that turned into a migraine on day 8. This was followed by an additional 3 days of a headache.

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 09Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), gabapentin, and calcium carbonate/ colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000).  The patient previously took ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) and experienced allergies; and the first dose of BNT162B2 on 21Dec2020 at 06:00 PM for COVID-19 immunization (intramuscular in left arm). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 11Jan2021, the patient had a lump in her left armpit and it finally has shrunk. The patient also had left side numbness and tingling on 11Jan2021. The adverse events resulted in emergency room or department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Tuesday 3/30 in the evening 3 middle toes on right foot began to swell. Over course of night, toes swelled, turned red, became painful. I iced them overnight and took ibuprofen. By Thursday morning they had developed blisters (the kind you get from hot spots / shoes rubbing). The pain subsided within ~36-48 hours, but the swelling, redness, and blisters remained for several days, slowly resolving over the course of about 7-10 days, with the blisters resolving first and the swelling and redness taking a few days longer. The blisters never did turn purple or peel like chillblains, they just resolved the way normal blisters do.

Sinus congestion and strange pains in my head. The pains could not be fixed by Tylenol or congestion medication. The pains are sharp and tugging in a single spot. This started exactly 5 days after receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer.   The allergies are persistent. Nothing seems to work well. I tried benadryl and Claratin, but they failed. I also experienced unusual pain in the deep tissue of my left breast, like there was a swollen and painful lymphnode. The pain lasted for several days.

                                                While receiving the vaccine I felt pain and burning.  That subsided after waiting the 15 minutes for monitoring.  When I arrived home my arm was sore, tight, and felt swollen.  I wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side, I wasn&#39;t able to lift normal everyday items and I felt shooting pains as if I was getting injected again.  I treated myself with Aleeve and iced my arm (20 mins about 3x a day) for 3 days.  Symptoms still persisted.  At my second dose my experience was very different from the first however, the pain from the first one still remained.  I inquired if I should still feel this pain and I was told to expect soreness.  At the urge of my family and coworkers I went to my doctor on 5/4 and he informed me that I have shoulder bursitis due to the poor administration of the vaccine.  The person who gave it to me either went in the wrong spot, or went too deep.  I am being treated with Methylprednisolone tablets (4mg 21 tabs) currently.  My doctor said that if this doesn&#39;t work I would have to see an ortho and possibly need to get cortisone injections.  There is no way to tell if this will heal or if I will have to live with this for the rest of my life.  Poorly skilled administration of this vaccine so far has changed my life...and not for the better.

That night I took tylenol at 9pm for my headache (recommend and approved by pharmacist who administered my shot), then I took my prenatal vitamin. Around 9:30 I had trouble breathing. It lasted throughout the night. I had to sit up all night. I had to take off my necklace due to my neck swelling. I couldn&#39;t take any deep breaths. I was able to fall asleep around 5am when it subsided a bit. I have continued to be short of breath today, neck still looks a bit puffy. It&#39;s hard to know whether the more mild difficulty breathing is due to pregnancy or not. I haven&#39;t had trouble breathing with this pregnancy unless I am active. This morning I was sitting on the couch and it was hard to breathe (but more mild than last night). No other side effects, my headache is gone and went away after I took the tylenol that night.

My sinuses and breathing passages swelled. The swelling went down gradually within 24 hours or so, but since then my lips and the area surrounding them have remained numb and it hasn&#39;t gone away. Hurts a bit to smile. I kept waiting for it to end so I could report what happened as far as duration, but it hasn&#39;t ended. I&#39;m slightly angry about this and also recognize it is what it is.  I regret getting this vaccine for sure though knowing it was a rushed process!  I called my doctor today and have an appointment next week to discuss my allergies and reactions in general.  Other reactions that happened but not sure if they are related -- intense, long lasting menstrual cramps post shot (just way more than usual) and blood for several days in my bowl movements. Those two items have subsided.

                                                At 8:55 AM, on June 1, 2021, a slight tingling was felt in the fingertips of my rught arm.  I then felt an increase of heart rate and my husband noticed my breathing was more rapid.  I began to feel a slight tingling on the back undersides of my tongue and the top of my throat.  I got up to walk and had to sit back down due to throat swelling and breathing reatriction.  It was apparent to others around me due to the thick choked breathing I was experiencing.  I felt my throat and jawline/cheeks feel puffed up.  A nurse appeared to assist me, check my breathing and heart rate, and monitor my symptoms.  I was not given an EPI injection, but was treated qith an adult dose of liquid benedryl, and 30 mg of Prednisone.  I was then instructed to take benedryl at 4 hour intervals along with a dose of Zyrtec one I got home and again at bedtime then a single dose of Zyrtec for the next few days.  I stayed an extra 30 min after the initial reaction took place for monitoring.

She felt tired when she went home and went to bed. When she woke up this morning, her tongue was swollen, as was the left side of her neck. She stated she was drinking lots of water, but it tasted like chemicals. I recommended to the patient to take 2 benadryl, and if the symptoms did not subside, to go to the emergency room.

                                                Shot given in L deltoid. Day 3-10 post vaccine I had extreme pain in what seemed like my left trapezius muscles. The pain was much worse in the evening/night and was sometimes absent during the day. Also on day 14 post vaccine (1/7/2021) I developed a cold sore for the first time in my life.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

Palpable lymph node along left clavicle with similar fluid filled swelling. Took motrin throughout the day and 50 mg of benadryl at bedtime. 1/13: Left arm pit still swollen. more tender with movement. While at work i put hot compress in my arm pit to help with the pain and shortly after i noticed my left arm had bright red streaks from my arm pit to my wrist. It also was very mottled looking. My arm felt tight/heavy  or kind of like a pinched nerve feeling.. I took motrin throughout the day for soreness and took benadryl at bedtime. I place ice pack under my arm during the evening as well.  1/14: Swelling remains in the armpit. Tenderness is getting better. Similar swelling around clavicle . Still taking motrin for inflammation and using ice pack under my arm.

                                                The day after I had the shot, i started to itch on my left arm , around the area I had the shot,,and then it developed into a rash like situation on both arms...the itching was so intense and then i noticed tiny bumps  and black and blue spots along my right and left arm.  It then spread to my thighs and upper chest area. I also had tightness in my throat and i took some Benadryll over the weekend hoping it would go away but it didn&#39;t. It got worse. On Monday, it was swollen on both arms and looked more like hives, red itchy with tiny bumps. On Tuesday, I went to my PCP who indicated it may have been an allergic reaction from the vaccine. She gave me Medrol and that is what I have been taking. Today the itching is a little less intense ..

I slept fairly well on Thursday evening. When I woke up on Friday morning, I had a pounding headache and my body ached. I was still sluggish and tired. Later that morning I also felt very nauseous. Pain relievers did not seem to help relieve any of my symptoms. I also had chills throughout the day. My arm and armpit hurt very bad throughout the day as well. Friday evening I did not sleep well. I was sweating and my body ached all over. Nothing seemed to provide relief. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I still had chills, body aches and a headache.  Pain relievers did seem to help. By about 2pm I started feeling better and like myself again.   Today is Monday and I do still have a sore arm and armpit. My armpit is swollen.

I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported experiencing throat swelling, face and lip tingling. Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

                                                The night of the side effects were normal, over all fatigue.  The next day my top, left upper lip started to go numb and swell, because of the timeline of the event and the lack of any other symptom I was not thinking allergic reaction, but took a benedryl just in case.  I feel asleep and woke up a couple hour later and the top upper lip swelling had started to go down, but my bottom lip had swollen and looked like a sausage.  At this point it was pretty late at night and figured the ER had bigger problems to deal with and this was either going to be better by morning or worse and would deal with it then.  When I woke up the next day I had some submental pain, but the swelling in my lip had gone down considerable.  At this point I noticed I had considerable pain in my collar bone, I felt the area, noticed a mass, went to the mirror and saw what looked like a golf ball under my skin at my collar bone.  My lymph nodes were completely swollen.  I went to urgent care who instructed me to follow up with my PCP if it didn&#39;t go down in a week, my PCP told me we would follow up with an ultrasound if it didn&#39;t go down in a month.  At this point this is getting ridiculous.  I understand that swollen lymph nodes are a side effect, but it should not be for a month.  This is causing me discomfort and gets worse the more I move around and on top of that I have been getting numbness in my left arm and hand which is what side the swollen lymph node is on.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine  Pt received first dose of vaccine in December and states that she only had a sore arm. She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

By 6 pm, she noticed that she had bilateral swelling of lymph nodes in neck by the clavicle bone (more prominent on right hand side - same side as injection).  She also experienced difficulty swallowing and went to the ER at 9pm.  At the ER she received solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and was discharged with hydroxyzine, Pepcid, solumedrol dosepak, zofran and epi-pen. At this time she was diagnosed with angioedema.  Swelling persisted and she contacted an allergist who prescribed additional antihistamines.  The allergist advised to her take Zyrtec or Claritin in addition to hydroxyzine day and night. The swelling continued to persist and two weeks later after returning to work for one day, she experienced feeling hot and flushed on right side, increased swelling and difficulty swallowing again and returned to ER on 1/25/21 and was treated with solumedrol and hydroxyzine and was discharged with solumedrol dosepak in addition to continuing antihistamines.  Upon returning to allergist, she was advised to take 4 zyrtec, 4 Claritin, Pepcid 40mg bid and hydroxyzine 10mg at bedtime.  PCP referred her to oncologist. After CT, oncologist diagnosed condition as bilateral lymphadenopathy and to return in 3 months for follow up.  PMH significant for ALL as a child (8 yrs), went into remission at 13yrs. PMH also includes DM2.

                                                Morning of March 5th: started feeling pain at the injection site right arm deltoid. Evening of March 5th: Pain is still present. I started to rub the arm. My arm became swollen, red, hard, warm to touch, itchy and painful to move. Later that night, I also felt something in my left forearm. I started using a cold pack. Morning of March 6th: right deltoid has not changed. Now alternating between heat and cold on arm. Evening of March 6th: left forearm feels like a sore muscle after exercising. I began to flex my wrist to stretch the muscle. My left forearm then became swollen, red, hard, warm to touch, itchy and painful to move.  Morning of March 7th: Went to urgent care. I was prescribed a cream and antibiotics and told to take an allergy pill. Morning of March 8th:  Right deltoid has lessened is swelling, redness, pain and itchy feeling.  I started to feel the sore muscle feeling in both calf muscles and right forearm. I did not stretch the muscle and it has not produced the same reaction.

I went to see my PCP and a CT scan of the right upper extremity was ordered. My CT scan diagnosis was lymphadenopathy. They then performed an U/S guided biopsy of my right upper extremity which was inconclusive. Since my report was  inconclusive, I now have to get a repeat biopsy and I am scheduled for 04-01-2021.  On 03-31-2021, I was also be going in for a marker place to demonstrate area concern for further diagnosis.

The pain in my back when clearing the throat shifted towards my spine, then started to radiate outward.  All symptoms gone except for soreness in the arm and the feeling in my cheeks.

                                                (note: I had no reaction to the first dose)  13 hours after receiving my second dose I had been in bed for a couple of hours unable to get comfortable because I felt weird. That?s when my ankles and feet began to itch. I checked for mosquito bites, none were there but I noticed that my ankles and feet were swollen. I applied a lotion recommended eczema  thinking my skin might be dry. Over the next hour the itching got worse and spread up my calves. That?s when I noticed that my tongue felt weird and kinda poofy. I?m used to occasional dry mouth due to my meds, but this was nothing like that. It freaked me out so I got up took Allegra hoping that on top of the Zyrtec I?d taken hours before would help. Since I was restless and desperately needed sleep  I took 1/2 of a 15mg trazadone tablet. That did the trip. No itching and I was able to sleep. Now I?ve been in bed all day with flu-like symptoms, I?m miserable and I?ve missed work. Unless I awake tomorrow morning feeling magically better I?ll miss work again.  The itching and swollen tongue  really freaked me out, hence my report today.

A 39-year-old female patient (nurse) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL8982, expiration date was unknown, NDC number), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 38 years on 18Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date were not reported) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) when she was 8 years old, but had been in remission since she was 13. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The pharmacy manager reported that the patient, who was one of her employees at the hospital, received her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 18Jan2021 and on an unspecified date had experienced lymphadenopathy afterwards that was still ongoing. The reporter described it as &#34;very impressive swelling&#34; at the base of neck that got inflamed when the patient got hot or stressed out, causing impacts on her swallowing. The reporter stated that the patient had gone to the emergency room twice, where it had been described as angioedema on an unspecified date and had also seen an allergist, who described it as a &#34;robust immune response.&#34; The reporter was concerned about the ongoing nature of this lymphadenopathy and would like any information that would help to treat this. The reporter also stated that the patient had gone through &#34;medical procedures and computerized tomography (CT) scans&#34; with unknown results on an unspecified date and would like to know if the patient would be eligible for the Program because of the event. The patient was in the group that got the vaccine first. The patient still had impressive lymphadenopathy and it was persisting. At first it was interfering with the patient&#39;s swallowing, but it was still occasionally interfering with her swallowing. The reporter was wondering if there was any more in house data that had been reported on this. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of angioedema, which included that the patient had been prescribed antihistamines, such as cetirizine (ZYRTEC), fexofenadine (ALLEGRA), hydroxyzine, famotidine (PEPCID), and methylprednisolone (MEDROL) dose packs. The patient was not recovered from the event &#34;lymphadenopathy,&#34; while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of angioedema, lymphadenopathy and other events  due to temporal relationship.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Nearly one week after the shot in my left arm, my right arm began to be taken over by a blister like rash. It started on my forearm and spread upwards, within days, my entire arm was bright red and covered in a blistery rash. It looked like I had a large, red sleeve tattoo that had taken over from wrist to shoulder. My right  arm was swollen and filled with fluid, and in some places, felt bruised. It was throbbing and tingling--the tingling was similar to when your foot falls asleep My chest became heavy and a small, presistent cough started. The rash began spreading across my chest and back, up my neck, across my abdomen and eventually appeared on my legs and left arm--but nothing like the right arm, which looked almost mutant. The weirdest part is it is not the arm the vaccine was administered into.

                                                I woke up with severe abdominal pain. Diagnosed as appendicitis. The surgeon noted that it was severely gangrenous upon removal.  Please note that while one of the causes can just be from hardened fecal matter, I do not have any issues with bowel movements, am regular, and have soft bowel movements.   I did become quite ill with headache, nausea, aches for two and a half days after the second vaccine, and that was my only known illness occurring before the appendicitis. As a virus can cause appendicitis, I wonder if my reaction to vaccine led to this as is was 18 days after the shot. While is was not an immediate event, I would imagine it can take time for an appendix to be affected to the point mine was before it became acute.

Inside upper lip in top most center area is also red and swollen and extends down front to teeth. I took some ibuprofen but it did nothing. I just now took two Benadryl and it might be feeling a slight bit of improvement. First symptoms started yesterday evening around 5pm.  This morning symptoms became more pronounced. And now at 8:30pm it feels much higher level of discomfort.  My left lymph node under mandible is a bit swollen too. And around 3pm I felt like I had a slight fever but didn?t take temp. I Otherwise feel fine and have no other medical issues occurring.   When I was 10 I was diagnosed as having PCN allergy. I recall something like this happening about five days after I was prescribed. Something like this also happened after taking Sulfa antibiotic but it was at back of throat about 4 days after first administration. That was in 2015.

Naproxen sodium taken orally (1-2x/day) &amp; CBD oil lightly applied to area (2-3x/day) helped to lessen pain. Swelling began to dissipate daily &amp; was undetectable by Sunday. On either Sunday (4/4/21) or Monday (4/5/21), I noticed some slight menstrual breakthrough bleeding. It was not the correct time in my cycle for menstruation and spotting is highly irregular - I have never experienced this. At first, I thought this was completely random &amp; unattributed to receiving the vaccine but saw on social media that many other women had experienced these effects after their shot. They also spoke of increased pain and heavy bleeding. As I haven&#39;t yet had my period again, I cannot comment on my experience at this time, but I am still experiencing the light breakthrough bleeding. I also noticed some slight fatigue through Monday evening (4/5/21).

They had put me in the 15 minute wait area, and I did not report my symptoms as I didn&#39;t immediately think it was cause for concern or necessarily a reaction related to the shot.  After the 15 minute waiting period, I returned to my vehicle and started driving. At this point, I was hot enough that I took off my coat and turned the A/C to 67 degrees even though it was 35 degrees outside.  About 10 minutes later (25 minutes after receiving the shot), my upper lip started tingling, and within another 5 minutes (30 minutes after the shot) I looked in the review mirror and noticed my face and upper lip were swollen.  The vaccinated clinic was 45 minutes from my home and there is not much between the clinic site and my home, therefore, I kept driving.  About 50 minutes after getting the shot, the face and lip swelling started to decrease . I was able to access Benadryl at this point in time by stopping at a pharmacy, which helped my allergic type symptoms from that point onward.  I did continue to have a headache, fatigue, and chills for the remainder of that day.

                                                I am a breastfeeding mother. I got my second Covid vaccine on Wednesday in my left arm. Within 24 hours I experienced very tender left axillary lymphadenopathy. Within 48 hours I experienced the worst clogged breast ducts of my entire life in my left breast (extensive, almost 50% of my breast, exquisitely painful). In my breastfeeding doctor group many docs are writing that they are seeing this too. Please consider recommending nursing mamas get vaccine in their thigh.

Rest and cool shower relieved the symptoms in a few hours.   Approximately 8 hours after the second dose of Pfizer COVID19 my torso, arms, neck and face became itchy and a rash covered all these areas.  Shortly after my hands swelled to twice the normal size.  Benadryl was taken and rest.  The itching subsided after 24 hours and the swelling went down a few hours after the Benadryl was taken.  A headache, body aches, and fatigue persisted through the next 48 hours followed by just body aches and fatigue now.

                                                On December 21st I got my first Pfizer Injection.  Had minimal side effects, that included a weird headache (I have migraines and this was unlike any migraine I ever had), it was like a halo above my ears and around the crown of my head.  I also had a sore arm.  No other issues.  On January 11th I got my second dose.  Again sore arm, nothing terrible.  This time I was prepared and over hydrated to prevent the headaches.  On day 2 after my shot I noticed both my shoulders starting to hurt and complained to my best friend I felt like a bus ran me over.  I said maybe it?s the shot but we shuffled it off to I slept funny.  2 weeks went by, same thing still going on; except some days my shoulders hurt so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.  About 4 weeks post injection my knees also started to hurt.  I visit my chiropractor every 2-3 weeks regularly since having my daughter 12 years ago because my pelvis rotates out of place; her and I discussed what was going on and she said she had a couple other patients complain of similar things and it typically gets better after 6 weeks.  So I give it a few more days, decide to message my family care doctor just to let her know what?s going on.  She checks me for Rheumatoid Arthritis- that?s negative.  Checked my CRP-  which were elevated to basically say I was having an inflammatory response.  (I knew all these things already lol you don?t just wake up at 38 with RA with no family history but whatever).  Another week went by and I am at work and can?t stand up to walk- like crying in pain my knees and arms hurt so bad.  One of the anesthesiologist gives me a Decadron injection.  An hour later it was like magic, I actually had relief.  Unfortunately less than 48 hrs later the pain came back.  I went to my family doctor and had a conversation about all of this.  They put me on a tapering dose of Prednisone for 10 days- because unfortunately the max dose for Decadron is 6 days we decided to do Prednisone so I could have more days.  I started with 100 mg a day of Prednisone and tapered it down for 10 days.  I finally felt back to normal and it was amazing!!  Then 5 days after the last dose of Prednisone the pain came back yet again in my knees.  It hasn?t come back as bad in my shoulders but it?s definitely worse in my knees.  My family doctors recommendation is for me to see a rheumatologist; which I am waiting on an appointment for now.

                                                *Patient was being observed in the patient waiting area post injection given at 11:00am. Had to wait 30 minutes due to prior reaction to MMR in December of 2020. At 20-25 minutes post injection patient started itching with arms and chest becoming red. Nurse and NP observing came over to patient and assessed. They administered Benadryl 25mg due to itching and redness. Advised patient to go home and also take Pepcid to help the Benadryl. Patient drove home immediately and by 12:00pm after looking in mirror lips and lower arms minimally swollen. Patient took another 25mg of Benadryl. No change, skin continues to break out and itch. Right lower forearm begins to swell more. Patient takes a third Benadryl 25mg along with a Prednisone 20mg PO.  After the 75mf of Benadryl total and Prednisone 20mg the reaction gradually subsides, but does not go away 100%. It is manageable at this time.  *Overnight the patient develops dizziness and headache.  *By morning (07:00am on 04/16/2021) the patient is itching minimally, dizzy, has headache, nauseated, and now is experiencing vertigo with what feels like equilibrium imbalance. Patient stays home from work and rests all day. No fever, no SOB, and no other signs at this time.  *Patient continues to show the above signs through Monday, April 19, 2021 with now on Tuesday April 20, 2021 additional signs of night sweats, muscle cramps, and soreness in her legs.

                                                A day after my 2nd dose of Pfizer covid vaccine, I noticed a lump on my leg with a dent next to it.  I went to my dr.  They did an ultrasound and mri and discovered it was a thrombosed subcutaneous varix at the lateral aspect of the proximal leg with peripheral enhancement and mild surrounding subcutaneous edema consistent with thrombophlebitis.  Dr decided on no treatment since it didn?t pose a risk.  I didn?t think to report this event until a friend had the same thing happen after his 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine.

                                                Patient reported on form that they had a previous allergic reaction to a meningitis vaccine in the past (10&#43; years ago). Immunizer informed patient to stay at pharmacy for the next 30 minutes following the vaccination to be able to monitor for allergic reaction. At around minutes 20-30, we checked in on patient who said she was experiencing shortness of breath. She began administering her inhaler that she had on hand (Ventolin/albuterol), it was not having any noticeable effect. Patient reported worsening shortness of breath and reported that she felt a swelling sensation and felt that her ears were swelling. She was visibly struggling with breathing. At this time we helped her back into the immunization area for privacy. Myself (pharmacist) and the other pharmacist on duty were talking her through breathing and trying to calm her down while helping her contact a family member in the area. We administered 1 dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg after about 10-15 minutes of her experiencing a visible serious allergic reaction. Right before administering the Epinephrine we instructed a technician on staff to call EMS. Within about 5 minutes of administering epi the patient began to be able to breathe better. We kept trying to keep her calm and within 10 minutes from administering EPI the EMS had arrived and they took her outside to allow her more fresh air to determine if she needed to go to the hospital.

                                                On day 2 after dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I developed pain, itching and swelling in two of my toes on the right foot, and one of my toes on the left foot. All three of the toes look purple and are painful to the touch, like pins and needles. One toe in particular has developed what looks like a small lesion near the toe nail. I am going to try some cortisone cream to see if it helps. Walking hurts a bit but I&#39;m still able to go about most of my normal activities. I have had no other symptoms since receiving the first dose of the vaccine.

                                                - I received my second vaccine on 4/7 since then I have had multiple complications - on 4/8 I experienced an extremely tender left shoulder and tender left sided axillary lymph node  - on 4/9 I experienced worsening axillary pain and new onset left breast tenderness that progressed to several clogged breast ducts (I am breastfeeding my child). I have experienced 1 clogged duct at a time in the past, but this was at least 4 separate clogs that reached across my breast in a band. This is the worst breast duct clog I have ever experienced and caused a significant temporary decrease in my milk production! Please encourage nursing parents to get their vaccines in their thighs! - On 4/18 I notice itching on my back and breast. My husband checked and took pictures and I had vesicles/ blisters. I saw my doctor for a telemedicine visit on 4/19 and was started on high dose acyclovir for herpes zoster/ shingles.  - I have had shingles in the past and this is a much more severe outbreak!

                                                About 2.5 weeks after the first dose, I began having pain and a rash developed near my temple/beneath my hairline. I initially thought it was an acne breakout. After I received the second dose I developed several symptoms including fever/chills, pain, and swollen lymph nodes in my neck and by my ear. These side effects were all expected however around the same time the rash from my temple area spread and worsened, and there was a large, half golf ball sized knot at my temple. I had also been informed of a possible COVID exposure that day, which would have been 1-3 days prior to the second vaccine dose. Upon discovering this knot and realizing the rash was painful and worsening I went to the ER on 4/13.  I was diagnosed with shingles.

                                                After initial dose of vaccine, eczema patch begun spreading up my arms (had only previously had it on my hands).  Some mild lymph node swelling and general fatigue between the first and second vaccine dose. After the second dose I had severe lymph node swelling (up to a baseball size lump under my arm). Within a week of the second dose, I was treated for a sinus infection (though had no symptoms such as congestion) with antibiotics and steroids. After going off steroids, the eczema rash that had occurred after the first shot cropped up again and spread from my scalp to my knees and was extremely itchy. I also had painful, swollen lymph nodes from my ears to collar bone. I was not wheezy, but was coughing and had a tight feeling in my chest frequently. I had to do 2 rounds of steroids, increase antihistamine doseage, and begin a steroid cream (topical). I also had to decrease my immunotherapy doseage significantly because I had more severe responses to my injections. My skin finally cleared after about 4 months though I am still having to take increased medication dosages and decreased immunotherapy doseages.

This 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN6201) via an specified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 at 09:00 (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to dogs, cats and horses all from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient had not been diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and had not received any other vaccines in the 4-weeks prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included multi-vitamins from an unknown date for an unknown indication. The patient previously received amoxicillin on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy; and received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number EN6198) on 03Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that on 25Mar2021 at 12:00, about 27-30 hours after receiving the vaccine she noticed a skin eruption near her hairline, about the same hour she noticed her lymph nodes had swollen to the size of a golf ball, and the lymph node on her neck on the left side where she&#39;d received the vaccine was visibly protruding from her neck. She further reported the lump near her hairline was raised and painful and the next day it turned into a blister that was tingling and stung sharply; she reported she was just diagnosed with singles and was an otherwise health adult with no major health issues, and was not under stress. She reported reading that the relationship between BNT162B2 and shingles was disproven but felt that these events were linked. The events were reported as non-serious and did not required hospitalization. The patient was treated with antiviral therapy and monitored by her doctor. The events required a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The clinical outcomes of skin eruption, lump near my hairline was raised and painful, lymph nodes had swollen to the size of a golf ball-protruding from my neck, blister that is tingling and stings sharply, and shingles were not recovered. It was also reported that since vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID.

Arm also began to swell and itch. Next day (April 19th) itchy swollen arm spread to shoulder blade and ribcage near injection site and was warm to the touch, strong chills, weakness, and body aches. Next day (April 20th) itchy swollen arm was still itchy and hot to the touch. The other symptoms were waning: no chills, still a little weak and still a little achy. Craved and ate meat. Next day (April 21st) arm swelling was going down. No more chills, less weak, and less achy. Craved and ate meat. Next day (April 22nd) arm swelling was less, but still swollen around the injection site (no longer on the shoulder blade and ribs), and a little itchy. Craved and ate meat. Next day (April 23rd) attempted a workout and felt super nauseous, fatigued, and weak afterwards (usually not how I feel after these workouts that I do weekly). Next day (April 24th) felt back to normal with mild itch at the injection site only.

                                                I add swollen lymph nodes underarm a day following vaccine. However, what I am more concerned about is that my right breast (side of right breast) is now firm and feels like a nodule. I did not have this before the vaccine. I am 5 months post my vaccinations and this is still there. My underarm lymph node swelling in the right arm went down after a few days from the time I got the vaccination. However, my breast tissue (perhaps even breast lymph node) still is not back to normal. I just had a mammogram in December (1 month prior to getting the COVID vaccine) and checked out fine on the 3D mammogram as well as the ultrasound. I am going to call my OBGYN to have him feel my breast and see if I need to go back for another mammogram. This will be good to see if anything has changed from pre-COVID vaccine to post-COVID vaccine.

                                                Wednesday morning at 2 am, I broke out into itching hives all over my chest, stomach and under arm pits.  I took a Claritin and applied Benadryl cream.  They were gone when I woke up that morning.  Around 3pm that afternoon,  my neck started itching.  By the time I got off of work at 5pm, my entire neck had broken out in hives and there were hives forming near both of my eyes. When I got home, my face had swelled and I was also breaking out on my arms, chest, stomach and upper thighs.  I went to the hospital where they treated me for an allergy.  I was given prednisone and Pepcid, a prescription for an EpiPen, and then told to take Benadryl and apply hydrocortisone cream which I had to purchase myself.  I took two Benadryls that night and applied the cream and the hives were gone by the morning.  Thursday, around 4 pm, my chest and stomach started itching.  I came home and took 2 Benedryls, and a cold shower to help relieve the itch.  I applied the hydrocortisone cream and took a nap.  I woke up 3 hours later, itching again, this time all over my arms, face, thighs and back.  My lips had swollen and my ears were itchy and red.  I called the urgent care number and was instructed by a doctor to come into the facility since my lips were swollen.  When I arrived, I was given a steroid (name unknown), Pepcid and Benadryl through IV.  The hives did not respond right away and in fact because to spread further after treatment.  After 2 steroid shots, they finally went away, though my lips were still  slightly swollen.   I was given a prescription for Prednisone and sent home.  Saturday morning, my arms and chest began to itch and turn red.  I applied hydrocortisone cream, took 2 Benadryls and the Prednisone as prescribed.  The itching subsided after an hour, but the redness remained the rest of the day.  As I am typing this on Sunday morning, I still have redness over my chest, stomach and arms, but no itching.

                                                First day after, I had mild symptoms - tired; I felt feverish at time even though I didn&#39;t have a fever. On the 23rd, I felt a little better that day but on the 24th, I really didn&#39;t feel well that day. I was tired and kind of slightly nauseated; not really wanting to eat but tried. I was so nauseated that night and had a headache. I wished I could have vomited that night. If I tried to move my head the pain was just terrible. 25th - called my COVID nurse line at work. She took me to get a COVID test and stayed with my mom that  night. I had nausea and fevers that night - up to 101. Headache was absolutely horrible. The COVID test was negative. 26th -severe  headache, nauseated, fever. I didn&#39;t feel great on the 28th but I did return to work that day. Lymph nodes on my neck were swollen - could see them across the room. Those were swollen on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and started to get better on Wednesday. I would take a 1/2 of Benadryl and that would allow me to rest for about 2 1/2 hours. On 25th - I woke up soaked when I woke up because I had such better sweating. The night of the 24th at 09:00 to midday Tuesday - that was pretty bad. I was breastfeeding at this time so didn&#39;t want to take too much to treat.

She acknowledged that it was very large and said that it should go down but if it didn&#39;t go down she would need to see me again. My Doctor let me know that from some literature that it could be a side effect.

                                                Since becoming fully vaccinated, I&#39;ve had two viral infections or episodes physically triggered. One was an upper respiratory illness which was mistreated with antibiotics as a bacterial infection. This latest viral episode manifests itself with fever blisters on my upper lip, fatigue, stomach pain, body aches, dehydration. It could&#39;ve been triggered by excessive sun exposure, but fever blisters are not reoccurring whatsoever for me. Both of these incidences are atypical for my body. I suspect either I&#39;m temporarily &amp; mildly immunocompromised. Or I&#39;m experiencing a hyper immune system that is overreacting to the presence of dormant viruses. It&#39;s in &#34;fighting mode.&#34;

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

I had onset of fever, chills and body aches starting a 230 pm day after vaccine. My baby started having fever 2 hours later. I direct fed him about one hour and a half after receiving the vaccine. He had fever Max of 101.7 and has continued to have after 72hours. He had change in the stool consistency and smell  but not diarrhea. He had decrease intake today but otherwise asymptomatic. I?m a pediatrician. His physician exam is normal except for tiny lymph nodes palpable in his axila and inguinal área. Today I checked his urine dip and was negative. No other testing has been completed. Fever has been control easily with Tylenol and the last 2 doses I have chosen to give Motrin. Baby is well appearing, active and playful otherwise. No history of contacts. We have no social contact with anybody for months, no grocery shopping, use N95 when seeing patients but I?m mostly Telehealth. My 5 yo is virtual student and does not have any symptoms. My husband has received first dose Covid and is also asymptomatic. I don?t have any reason to think there is any other etiology rather than my vaccine administration. My symptoms resolved after 30hours. I only had mild arm pain with first dose and baby was completely asymptomatic

                                                The injection of the vaccine was fine.  My arm started getting sore about an hour afterwards.  The next morning I could not lift my arm at all.  About 18 hours after getting the vaccine I had severe body and joint aches, my lymh node in my armpit was swollen and sore (on injection arm), I had a headache, and I was exhausted.  This continued for 48 hours.  The swelling of the lymph node went down and the body and joint pain lessened.  However 5 days after I am still exhausted, dealing with a headache, my arm is still sore, and am experiencing joint pain and back pain.  I was diagnosed with COVID 19 on December 4, 2020, with COVID Pneumonia on Decemeber 13, 2020, and with Post Viral Syndrome on December 28, 2020.

Then on Saturday night the body aches were progressively worse and concentrated on left side of body. Joints were affected including left wlbow, wrist, shoulder. Hot viral rash appeared on arm right above left elbow that became painful with swelling and  erythema. In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

Otherwise she appeared well and had normal vital signs. No other symptoms. She was observed for 40 minutes and her symptoms persisted so she was transferred to the ER. There were no objective findings at the ER after a workup. She was given toradol for her headache and the plan is for her to be discharged home today.

I do occasionally get similar reactions from food/lotions/pet hair/skin contact-most typically in the neck/face area. I did eat an ice cream bar with peanuts listed-which sometimes can cause neck hives for me-although these bars haven?t done this before.

A non-pregnant 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at 39-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart murmur, Latex allergy; both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported; and no other medications were received within two weeks of the suspect vaccine. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced: felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side (non-serious), streaks of heat along the back of her scalp (non-serious), heat in her chest (non-serious), right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder (non-serious), hot flashes (non-serious). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient, ten minutes after the vaccination, felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side. This was followed by streaks of heat along the back of her scalp, and heat in her chest. After about an hour, the right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder. The patient&#39;s &#34;body stayed that way for about 20 hours.&#34; The patient also experienced hot flashes, which was not something that she ever had before. The patient feared getting the second dose because her body felt so off after the first dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination with the suspect vaccine.   The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                The day after vaccination I had fever chills and my Lymph node in my right armpit got swollen as big as a golf ball. It was sore, the pain was constant and went down after a week and half.  I had a phone consult with my doctor, No symptoms after the first dose of vaccine.

Overnight Sunday to Monday, the lymph node in my armpit of the same arm became swollen and tender. I sent a note to my PCP through the Patient Portal so he was aware and could note it in my medical chart.   I know from researching this that a small percentage of people experience this side effect after receiving their COVID vaccination. While I will continue to monitor it, it should most likely resolve on its own over time (days to months).

And the following days I had a headache and felt very under the weather with a low-dose fever. On Saturday 3/20, I started to get achy muscles and joints. On 3/21, I had around five incidents of diarrhea. Today, 3/22 I called my doctor about the joint and muscle pain. We decided constantly taking ibuprofen for a few dates is the course of treatment for now.   I would consider it moderate pain, I?m struggling doing daily activities without pain intervention. Most of the pain is in my hips, knees, ankles, toes, and hands.

She had left the parking lot after 30 minutes of monitoring, however, upon reaching the exit, started to feel extremely unwell. As such, she was directed back to the monitoring area for urgent evaluation. Patient-reported bilateral UE tingling, subjective facial and oral swelling, and panic-type symptoms. EMS was alerted and patient vitals were collected along with a 12 lead EKG. VS were WNL. 12 lead showed sinus tachycardia.  encounter After serial monitoring and careful evaluation, it was evident that the patient was suffering a panic attack without signs of serious allergic reaction or airway compromise. After the passage of an additional 15 minutes, the patient had returned to baseline without additional intervention. She was returned home with her husband as the driver.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

By Tuesday, March 30 ( five days after vaccination), lymph nodes in my left armpit and along my neck on left side and in left groin area were suddenly swollen (to a noticeable degree under my arm, so much I thought initially it was a lump and needed to see my doctor) and painful. This lasted several days. I also suddenly began my menstrual cycle a full two weeks ahead of schedule?the same day as onset of lymph swelling.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Mar2021 08:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cystitis interstitial and allergies: cat and bee stings. Concomitant medications included prednisone epinephrine, and chlorphenamine maleate (ANTIHISTAMIN) taken. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. After about 30 minutes, on 20Mar2021 09:00 AM, the patient experienced tongue started swelling and would not subside. She tried antihistamine all day with no success. She went to Urgent Care and received steroid shot and was prescribed prednisone that same evening. She was told to return if symptoms not improved in three days. The patient returned on Monday evening and was sent to the ER. She was diagnosed with Angioedema and given more antihistamines and steroid shot and epinephrine in IV. The patient was currently monitoring and seeing an allergist to follow up. Her tongue was still not back to normal. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of tongue started swelling and would not subside was not recovered, and of angioedema was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient had not been been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. No follow-up attempts are possible; information on the batch/lot number cannot be obtained.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Facial flushing Overnight fever/chills Foggy mind  Intermittent / On and off effects for the first 7 days:  Lightheadedness/dizzy/woozy feeling Foggy brain Swollen-feeling fingers Facial flushing  On the 6th day I had decaf coffee which is usually fine for me (though I&#39;m extremely caffeine sensitive) and thought I was having an adverse caffeine reaction - Felt shaky and a little unsteady. But I was able to sleep fine, and I don&#39;t think it was caffeine, I think it was a bout of shakiness tied to the vaccine. Morning of 7th day still feel a little shaky with facial flushing.

                                                Urticaria on upper arms and upper tights and waist started Feb. 20.  I  took OTC Benaddryl and used hydrocortisone cream with no improvment. On Feb. 25 I saw an urgent care who gave me a course of prednisone with no help.  The urticaria continuly got worse and lasted all day with new areas effected. On  March 8, I woke up to my left eye swollen shut and my whole body covered in hives and on fire and itching. I saw urgent care again who told me to see a dermolotogist. MArch 9 saw sermotoligst who gave me a cobetasol cream and hydroxyzine 10mg. I was told to also take claritin 10mg daily. Hives improved less body area and no swelling eye but still serveer hives. March 19 my legs were swelling and  I incraesed my dose of hydroxyzine to 20mg  and claritin 30mg per my dermotoligst orders.   March 30 night I woke up to shortness of breath almost went to the ER. My dermotoligist orderd me an epi pen.  I had a CBC, complement 3 &amp;4 lab, metobolic panel, ASA , and h.pylori labs done all were within normal limits or negative. I had 2 punch biospies done one from hives on each arm on March 25- results given April 15 of Urticardia.

                                                Mild anaphylaxis--tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway; This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot was unknown due to not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at age of 39-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eczema, known allergies: Food sensitives including gluten and dairy. Rashes with prolonged skin contact with metals or adhesives. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID was not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylaxis-tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway on 19Mar2021. Started about 2min after shot. Occlusion lasted for 7minutes. EMS said vitals were normal. Swollen tongue lasted 24 hours. Have never had an allergic response to any vaccine before. The events were non-serious. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of anaphylaxis was recovered in 2021, of tongue swelling was recovered on 20Mar2021, of occlusion of airway was recovered on 19Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event anaphylaxis cannot be totally excluded.

                                                I had adverse reactions to vaccine #1 and vaccine #2. With vaccine #1 on 3/30 I developed a bad skin rash under my arms. With vaccine #2 I experienced the expected side effects (low grade fever, body aches) but then developed a very swollen lymph node under left arm - still going on five days later. I also experienced terrible SVT &amp; heart palpitations two days after the second vaccine. This was very scary and unsettling.

                                                Shortly after vaccine, I became extremely fatigued. Night of receiving vaccine I developed headache, chills and a fever (101F). The next day, along with fatigue, headache, chills, and fever, I was nauseous. Two days after, I developed a slightly painful swollen lymph node under my right arm (vaccine side) - but, my other symptoms have subsided except for a slight headache.   The injection site itself was slightly painful and swollen on the day of the vaccine but this is gradually going away.

A 39-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN16208) at the age of 39-years-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant. Medical history included Hormonal Acne, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included spironolactone taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium alginate (PEPCID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took cefalexin monohydrate (KEFLEX) and experienced allergy. The patient initially had some intermittent numbness/tingling of her inner upper lip that began within the first hour of receiving the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and lasted about 24 hours. Six days following vaccination on 25Mar2021, the patient began having muscle cramps/muscle soreness in her lower extremities that progressed to her upper extremities and neck, By the eighth day on 27Mar2021, she had developed numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet. On this day, she also began having muscle weakness and was unable to walk unassisted by the end of the day. She was seen in the Emergency room (ER), admitted, and transferred to another facility. The patient hospitalized for 1 day. She underwent a Computerised tomogram (CT) scan of my head, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of my brain/neck, lumbar puncture, and extensive blood work. All of her work up was unremarkable except for showing that she had a Vitamin D deficiency. Her symptoms began to improve without treatment in the hospital, and she was discharged home with the diagnosis that she had most likely had an unusual, adverse reaction to her 1st dose of the COVID 19 vaccine and was instructed not to receive my 2nd dose. Covid tested post vaccination (Nasal swab) on 28Mar2021: Negative. The outcome of the events &#39;numbness/tingling of my inner upper lip&#39; was recovered on 20Mar2021 and the outcome of the other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported Myalgia, Muscle cramps, Hypoasthesia, Parasthesia, Pheripheral swelling, Muscle weakness and Vitamin D Defiency.

                                                Felt lightheaded after receiving vaccine. Stayed at pharmacy for 30 mins. Later that evening had intense headaches and the feeling of blood rushing to my head. The next morning my headache subsided some and I drove to work. My throat felt tight and continued to feel tight through the morning. At 11:30 I called the pharmacy because my throat tightness continued to get worse and it was difficult to eat my breakfast. Also my lips began to go numb and tingle. I was told to immediately go to the ER. I went to ER and was seen by Dr. in the ER. They did xrays of my throat and bloodwork, inserted an IV and gave me steroids thru the IV. Within about 30-40 mins I began to feel better. I was prescribed steriods to take for 6 days at home. I have continued to have headaches, mainly at night and extreme inflammation in my neck, chest/clavicle area, back of neck and shoulders from my lymphnodes, difficulty sleeping flat.

                                                lips starting to swell like a balloon (angioedema); headache; chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other hcp (patient).   A 39-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age of 39 years old, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: ER8729) at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient medical history was not reported. Known allergies was None.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Mar2021 (age of 39 years old)(Lot Number: EN6208) at single dose for covid-19 immunization.

                                                I was diagnosed by my neurologist with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  9 days after my 2nd Pfizer shot (Sunday, March 28th), I felt tingling in my feet. On Monday night I felt tingling and pain in my feet, but I was sure it was passing and said nothing since the pain was manageable at a level 2?3. On Tuesday I was getting concerned. My feet were now tingling and in pain all day, and the pain had escalated to a level 5. On Wednesday I suddenly realized that my life could effectively be over soon. The pain was at a 7-8, and I could barely get through my day. My body felt like there were tiny needles shooting electricity into me, and it felt all-consuming. It was unrelenting, and I suddenly understood why the CEO (a COVID survivor) killed himself after suffering through constant ringing in his ears. It became CRYSTAL clear how chronic pain made regular working life impossible, and I wondered how I would get by on disability and how long it would take to kick in after applying. I started panicking while focusing enough to book a doctor?s appointment for that Friday. By the end of Wednesday my calves and thighs were severely cramped, and by Thursday my eyes were tingling and my hands and arms were tingling with pain. I feared MS since it runs in my family. I was terrified and confused and made an appointment with a PCP for Friday, April 2nd.

The onset seemed to be sudden and within 1 hour I was feeling very sick. I took 500mg acetaminophen. The next day I felt better but still had to take acetaminophen due to some fever and still swollen lymph nodes. The swelling on my lymph nodes did not fully go away for 3 days. My face was visibly swollen on the left side. I also had bad diarrhea on Thursday and Friday without any change in my diet. I don&#39;t know if that was a side effect too.

Feels like atrophy or either fat or muscle. It can be described as a dent with a pit when you put pressure on the area. The skin looks normal, it does not look like a smallpox shot scar. Contacted my primary care physician, but she is out of the office for two weeks. Made an appointment with her on June 3rd to determine whether it would be advisable for me to have the second shot of the series, which is overdue.  I cannot find any information about this reaction online so I am concerned.

                                                On 1/21/21, approximately 59 hours after I received the Pfizer\BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine #2 without any immediate adverse events, I woke up in the middle of the night with subjective fevers, sweats, chills,  generalized weakness with dizziness and feeling faint, nausea, diarrhea, and severe pelvic/lower abdominal pain (though I was also in the process of starting my menstrual cycle).  I also vaguely noticed an erythematous rash on my chest and abdomen at that time.  I took a dose of ondansetron for nausea and acetaminophen for pain.  Later that morning (1/21/21), I continued to have generalized weakness, subjective fevers and chills, extreme fatigue, nausea, and a morbilliform-type rash most prominently on my torso (chest, abdomen, back) and some areas of my upper arms and thighs, as well as bright red and hyperemic palms and soles that had a prickly sensation throughout.  I no longer had abdominal pain, but did have significant polyarthritis with difficulty moving my joints without pain.  This included my knees, elbows, ankles, wrists, as well as fingers/hands especially.  My fingers and toes felt very swollen and I had trouble putting my normal enclosed shoes on.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol during this time for symptom control.  Later I added diphenhydramine, loratadine, and famotidine.  These symptoms waxed and waned in intensity for at least 8 days with continued spread of rash, extreme fatigue, ongoing joint pain, and subjective fevers.  The only measured fever was on 1/23/21 when I had access to a thermometer - my oral temperature was 100.7F if I recall correctly.  I never had any respiratory symptoms. On 1/29/21 I saw Hospital Allergist Dr in order to participate in a research study on adverse vaccine reactions; I did not have a formally documented medical appointment with her for my medical records.  By that time, my energy level was slowly improving and I was able to return to work.  My arthritis symptoms had nearly fully resolved, however, my rash had gone from not particularly bothersome to very diffusely pruritic.  I began to take cetirizine for symptoms instead of loratidine. In addition, the skin along my L palm began to slough and peel off, most notably in the webspaces between my thumb and index finger bilaterally and the tip of my L thumb and L ring finger.  These areas of my palm had the most notable peeling and sloughing around 2/2/21 and by 2/7/21 my R palm was also peeling in similar fashion to the L.  On 2/11/21, I noticed that the skin along my L sole, particularly between all five digits had begun to peel quite markedly; large connected pieces of skin were sloughing off.  The sloughing on the L foot spread from between the toes and the ball of the foot to the arch and then the heel over several days.  On 2/14/21, the R foot/sole began having the same findings, with large amounts of sloughing first between the toes and then extending to the ball of the foot, arch, and ultimately the heel.  Some sort of foot/sole peeling continued through the final week of February 2021 and into early March.
