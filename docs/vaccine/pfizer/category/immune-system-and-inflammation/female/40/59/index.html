                                                Angioedema; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (patient). A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1284, intramuscular in the right arm (also reported as right shoulder), first dose on 22Dec2020 00:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s relevant medical history included severe reaction to some animal dander and pollen, severe reactions to poison oak, possible drug induced reactions (unspecified) post C-section, mild rash with influenza vaccine this year (2020) (with no other hx of adverse reaction to a vaccine); had allergies to pollen, mold, some animals. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) and experienced rash. The patient had no covid prior vaccination nor was she tested post vaccination. Adverse event reported was angioedema on 24Dec2020 with outcome of recovering. Systems started appearing on 23Dec2020 evening with slight rash and fluid collection under right eye. Developed more rash on 24Dec2020. In the evening to early morning of 25Dec2020, symptoms worsened significantly. Rapid swelling to face occurred. Swelling was concentrated around eyes and cheeks the most. Both right and left side of the face and neck were affected. However, the right side face had a more pronounced reaction. MD ordered oral prednisone and Benadryl as treatment plan. Also, ordered episode-pen for a worst case scenario. Symptoms have been improving under treatment but still persist some. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse event start date was 24Dec2020 (as reported). The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event angioedema was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and temporal relationship.

It was painful and partially mobile.  No other symptoms other than those of headache a few days prior mentioned below. I went to urgent care on 12/29 where CXR and soft tissue ultrasound were ordered. CXR normal. US 12/30 showed cluster of lymph nodes in that area.   Lump appears to be smaller this week and not painful.   Also, I developed a severe migraine on 12/26 (5d post vaccine). So severe that it was debilitating which is unusual for me. It lasted approximately 36 hours.

I thought it was just a normal vaccine reaction because I have had those in the past.  It seemed to get a little smaller and less red/warm in the next few days but then started to get more red and swollen in the past 24-48 hours. It has been a week since the vaccine. It is itching some now for the past 2 days as well.

                                                Woke up this morning with swollen, and extremely tender right armpit area. It is visually swollen compared to the left and is very painful. I am under the assumption this is likely a swollen lymph node post second vaccination. I have taken ibuprofen in attempt to help with pain and inflammation but does not seem to be helping much at this time. I anticipate this will improve over time.

                                                ?Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. My Left Leg (entire leg) was swollen &amp; Numb) I received my vaccine and when I arrived home about 1pm that day My leg felt odd.  when walking, standing I felt an odd sensation in my left foot/lower calf area.  I had body aches mild which progressed at night especially pain running down my left side of my body.   The next morning I put on my clothes for work and my body still mild aches but the pant leg was tight especially around the calf.  My My left foot was swollen as well as my shoe fit tighter.  I also had a numbing sensation through the leg.  I had an ache behind the calf and the heel of my foot as well as the left foot of my left foot.  The swelling remained and I worried I might have a DVT.  I called my primary care DR office and they said I should go to the ER.  I called employee health at my job and they told me go to the ER.  So on 12/29/2020 I went to the ER.  The providers there also thought I had a DVT especially after examining my leg and recognizing the significant swelling.  My US venous doppler showed negative for DVT however a significantly enlarged lymph node.  As of today the swelling is much improved however still slight.  The sensation in my left foot is still not the same as before.  I have a numbness and tingling sensation that runs from my Left lateral calf down to the sole of my foot.

This back pain continues today (1/26/2021).  On 1/21/2021, in the early hours of the morning, I woke to hives over my entire trunk, left arm (injection site), and left thigh.    *This subsided in maybe 10 or so hours with antihistamines.   On 1/23/2021, at approximately 1100, I felt heat in my left arm. This coincided with a heavy feeling in my left arm. When examined, I noted that my upper arm was slightly swollen, blotchy, and had a reddened rash approximately 4x4 inches. Minor itching.    *The swelling subsided by 1/25/2021, but the heat and reddened rash continues today (1/26/2021).

The patient was hospitalized after receiving the COVID vaccine on 08Jan2021. She was admitted to the hospital, the consumer (the sibling&#39;s wife) thought, on either 14-15Jan2021. She was not sure of the admitting diagnosis but patient was being treated for Guillain Barre Syndrome. Patient has had a spinal tap on an unspecified date, no results were known. The patient was very healthy, in general the consumer knew she had no typical comorbidities. The reason it was thought to be related was she was perfectly healthy prior and right after she got the vaccine, the patient&#39;s tongue started to go numb, that day or the day after (in Jan2021). The events required a visit to Emergency Room, but not to Physician Office. Weight was unknown but the patient was very fit, and BMI (Body mass index) had to be in the normal range. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Shortly after the vaccination I was still having the abdominal distention so I called to see if I could defer the 2nd vaccine because I wasnt feeling well and still experiencing AE from the 1st dose.  I was advised I still had to get the vaccine so I did and by 2:30pm I begin to have severe facial swelling causing asymmetrical shaping of my face, my head was hurting extremely bad, fatigued and felt really bad.  I had to lay down because my head was hurting, felt like I had pressure on the top of my head, neck and back.  The pain was so bad I was transported to the ER and was isolated d/t previous COVID infection and all while there the  my body felt as if it was steady swelling.  I was hurting so bad I couldnt stand to be touched.  I was given another round of steroids.  I was advised I had COVID pnemonia and was given IM decadron, IM regalin and a subQ injection of immatrex for the headaches and administered ibuprophen and tynenol for the headache as well.  I was discharged with a prescription of regalin and decadron.  The ER dr. states I shouldnt have taken the 2nd vaccine because I was still suffering from COVID-19.  The abdominal distention had dissolved but the congestion just will not clear up even after 3 rounds of steroids.  Asoumedrol was prescribed by my ENT but it didnt help either so I have a CT Scan scheduled for next week with my ENT and has not been able to return to work since the 1st dose 12/22. I have be retested for COVID-19 on both 1/15 and 1/25 and both results are still positive for COVID.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 40-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL8982), intramuscular at left arm on 21Jan2021 15:38 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Tachycardia (started about 4 years ago), Hypertension (started about 4 years ago) and Essential tremor from 2020 (she has been having symptoms for a while; finally, during the summer of 2020, she was diagnosed through a neurologist) and anxiety, all ongoing; pain, back problems and sleep disorder.Concomitant medications included ongoing Tizanidine as muscle relaxant for back problems, ongoing Metoprolol tartrate for hypertension and tachycardia, Primidone for Essential tremor and ongoing Clonazepam for essential tremors, to help her sleep, and also for anxiety. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient got the first COVID vaccine dose. Afterwards, she went to school and it &#34;was downhill from there&#34;. 5 days of persistent symptoms including sweating, muscle pain, joint pain and left hand swelling. It was further reported that she had to wait 15 minutes and then she drove home which is about a 35-minute drive. So about 45 mins after receiving the vaccine, she noticed her tongue, it was more on the right side of her tongue, she can&#39;t explain the sensation. She couldn&#39;t really taste. Things didn&#39;t taste right to her. This lasted 24 hours. She woke up the next day, 22Jan2021, feeling not quite right. She took some Tylenol that morning and went on into school. She took some ibuprofen in the middle of day, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. She has a history of tachycardia, but her pulse kept reading normal. She had a drink she was drinking from lunch and she ended up having the remainder of it the last few hours of that day. At about the end of her workday, around 15:30 she was finishing the Cdrink off and she said to herself &#34;oh that taste like a regular drink again&#34;. This tongue sensation/lack of taste resolved. At that point, she got really excited because she thought this was all that she would experience with the vaccine. She was grateful she had the chance to have the vaccine. She mentions her arm was very sore right off the bat. She experienced immediate soreness in her arm right after receiving the COVID-19. She thought when they were injecting her, it hit her bone. In fact, she joked about this with the person administering the vaccine. The person at the facility told her to rub it, it actually helps with that. This kind of soreness didn&#39;t seem like a major problem. She was still experiencing this soreness. If she is sitting on the couch sideways, with her side of her arm against the couch, she has pain that extends up into her neck. It was pretty painful. Friday, 22Jan2021 (24 hours later after receiving the vaccine), by the time she got home from work, she was really sore. She had some real muscle pain around her hips and upper thighs, both of them. The soreness extended across. It was like she had inflammation that started flaring up. She felt pretty sore that evening. It wasn&#39;t like a normal muscle soreness. She went to bed because she was pretty tired. The next morning (Saturday, 23 Jan 2021), she couldn&#39;t get off the couch. She had such bad muscle and joint pain. She slept off and on, the pain was pretty bad. Her whole body had so much stiffness and inflammation. Every muscle and every joint just hurt. She confirmed that she hasn&#39;t been able to regulate her body temperature. This has been going on since Saturday evening (23Jan2021). She stated that this wasn&#39;t normal for her. She does take medications to lower heart rate but she hadn&#39;t taken it. She was talking to her best friend about how she had been sore and slept all evening. She checked her pulse and it had dropped down to 40. Her O2 level was at 92. She didn&#39;t think it was that big of a deal. Her best friend was kind of freaking out about it. She had such pain and stiffness in her chest that extended across her shoulders, it made it difficult to breathe. She was laboring to breathe. She checked her pulse thinking maybe she was feeling anxious about it and her HR was up, but it wasn&#39;t. She states happened so bad yesterday, yesterday was worse than before. She got up on Sunday morning, 24Jan2021, and took a hot shower. When the water from the shower head hit her chest, clarified as her upper chest muscles just below her collar bone, the pressure of the water hitting her was painful. However, she was able to get up, she was moving around. Still the whole time. she had this fever-ish feeling. Her kids were telling her that they were sweating because she had the house at 76 degrees. Monday morning, 25Jan2021, she woke up and she was itchy around her left forearm. She was really itching on Friday night, but she didn&#39;t think anything about it. When she took a hot shower yesterday (25Jan2021), a red rash came up on her chest and it looked like she had hives on her forearm. She didn&#39;t know if the hot water flared that up, but she doesn&#39;t have any allergies. She also had gastrointestinal issues. She has had some nausea that has lasted the entire time since she received the vaccine. She clarifies the nausea has came and gone. She hasn&#39;t had much of an appetite. They thought she had a fever yesterday at school. It was 99. something but she had already taken Tylenol a couple hours before and she was sweating so much. She states she has also had diarrhea the last few days, clarified as the last 2 days (24Jan2021). She has already spoken to someone to report her symptoms but wasn&#39;t sure about and had question about getting the second vaccine dose. She reported having gone to Urgent care where she was told she had Post covid vaccine syndrome and that she shouldn&#39;t have a problem with the second dose. She explained she went to the urgent care yesterday, 25Jan2021. She called her doctor that morning and was told to continue to treat her symptoms and take ibuprofen and Tylenol but if she got worse, to go to urgent care. So, she went to the urgent care (Product information for the Tylenol and Ibuprofen she has been taking (Ibuprofen: UPC/NDC: not provided when probed. Lot: P142385 Expiry date: Apr2023 and Tylenol: UPC/NDC: not provided when probed. Lot: P121664 Expiry date: Sep2023). The nurse just explained (Name Withheld) was having the same exact symptoms as the patient, except it was (Name Withheld) second dose. Her symptoms were identical to the patient. The patient wasn&#39;t initially sure if it was from the vaccine or if it was her anxiety. The patient didn&#39;t feel anxious and her heart rate wasn&#39;t up. The patient told she didn&#39;t think anxiety caused her to feel like she had a fever. The school nurse looked it up and found out more symptoms kind of wax and wane. Her symptoms got much worse. On 25Jan2021, Test: Rapid COVID-19 test Result: Negative. The event immediate soreness in arm was not recovered; event couldn&#39;t really taste, things didn&#39;t really taste right to her recovered on 22Jan2021 and nausea recovered in Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021101606 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

Started with my cheeks within minutes of the shot, got worse over the next hour. It took about 4-5 hours to dissipate. But even the next day, I have been a little itchy.

                                                I developed a very bad migraine about 4 hours after getting the vaccine that lasted all night and the next day my arm was very tender where I got the shot. The adverse side effect I&#39;m most concerned about developed 2 days later. I noticed it hurt to turn my head and realized I had a lump on the right side of my neck sort of under my chin but a little to the right of that. It&#39;s making my throat hurt even though my throat itself is fine and the pain from this knot is radiating up to my right ear. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a swollen lymph node. I&#39;ve had swollen lymph nodes before with strep throat but never have they hurt as much as this is and I&#39;ve never had just one lymph node swell until now. I got the shot on  a Saturday and this symptom began on Monday. I&#39;ve been dealing with it for 3 days now, so if it&#39;s now gone in 2 more days I&#39;ll be going to my doctor for evaluation. I just wanted to report this and I was also wondering if this reaction has anything to do with the brain tumor surgery I had for an acoustic neuroma brain tumor and they put a metal plate in my head that my body had a bad reaction to causing hives, itching, and a lot of extra pain and irritation.

                                                After getting the shot, I walked over to the observation area a few yards away. I sat down and my vision went blurry and the room lights were too bright. I spoke with a dr about taking ibuprofen for my ankle, as I was told to only take Tylenol. The dr said that I was fine to take it. I didn?t want to ask about my vision because I was embarrassed and didn?t want to be stressing or panicking and that be the cause of my vision issues. But it didn?t subside so I checked with a nurse before leaving, about 15 mins after the vaccination  and asked if I was ok and she said yes, that she only had 1 other person tell her about blurred vision. I walked to my car and the sun was so bright I had to shield my eyes. I got in the car and took my mask off. I looked in the mirror and my cheeks and chin were flushed but my skin was pale. My husband sat with me for 10 mins and then went in for his shot. At this point it had been a little over 30 mins since getting vaccinated. I FaceTimed my mom so I wouldn?t be alone. As we were talking she said my face was getting puffy and I was getting darker circles under my eyes. I got off of the phone with my mom and called my husband on FaceTime. I asked him to talk to the dr for me and let her see my face. She said my face was swollen and red and asked if I could breathe or felt like my throat was closing over or tongue was swollen. I told her no. Once again I was told I was ok and to take Benadryl. An hr or so after the 1st dose vaccination I was able to get Benadryl and Tylenol. In a 12hr period I took 2 doses of Benadryl and 2 doses of Tylenol. My face got better in 12-24hr but I still have blurred vision and light sensitivity.

                                                Headache since about 15 minutes after injection. Injection site pain started about 10 minutes after injection and stopped after day 2. Tiredness started a few hours after injection and got better after day 4. Muscle pain and chills started the same day and stopped on day 4. Injection site swelling started on day 2 and went down on day 4. Injection site redness started as pink but is now purple. Nausea started within 10 minutes of injection but went away the same day. Feeling unwell started the same day of the injection and has been ongoing off and on since. My whole arm felt swollen on Saturday. The same day, I started noticing blood blisters on my fingertips on my left hand. More and more have shown up since then.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine on 3/5/21. The symptoms began on 3/7/21 with pain in my upper left arm. The next following night, I was awakened by sharp pains from the top of my left arm to my fingers. Even the back of my left arm is swollen. It even traveled down my back. I went to urgent care on Sunday 3/9/21 to see what had happened. A CNP said it seems musculoskeletal and the pain radiated from the injection site. I&#39;ve taken Tylenol, Ibuprofen, been prescribed muscle relaxers and steroids to numb the pain but it doesn&#39;t work.  This is still occurring to this day.

This was all that same night. The next day I had the same issues adding the sore arm of the injection site and feeling very tired all day. the next day from there am I am feeling better but am still experiencing shortness of breath, I am using my inhaler, I am still itchy but not as severe as the first night or next day. The arm tenderness has gone unless you touch the injection site and am no longer feeling over tired.

I was monitored for 30 minutes by the nurse and as the symptoms were not getting worse she suggested I drive home and take Benadryl. It was a 45 minute drive. Halfway home (about one hour after my shot) I started experiencing itching, swollen tongue, swollen lips. I took 62.5 mg of Children?s Benadryl and met up with my husband and he drove me to the ER, arriving at about 10;15.  After being there about 15 minutes some of my symptoms started going away. At about 11 a rash appeared on my chest. The ER doctors gave me Pepcid 10 mg around 1130 or so. They just charge me and recommended I follow up with my allergy doctor.

Took 50mg prednisone 2 benadryl and albuterol inhaler.  Breathing got better and hives went away but still had swollen throat and took pepcid. Headache afterwards but that&#39;s typical of an allergic reaction.  I can&#39;t be sure it was from the vaccine or not but nothing I did yesterday would normally trigger that reaction

My left upper thigh had a burning feeling around the outer part and in the goin on that thigh a painful lymph node. That afternoon I had a burning sensation on my left butt cheek. When I looked I noticed a very small rash with blisters. I waited through the weekend because I knew the OBGYN was not open. I called first thing Monday morning and made an appointment as soon as they could see me which was the next day  (1/5/2021)at 3:30pm. The doctor took samples and sent them to the lab for testing. The test was positive for shingles. I am now taking valtrex for shingles.

Since the injection I had been getting headaches almost daily, mostly on my right side of my head.  On Dec. 5, 2021 I noticed I was getting a sore eyebrow.  Later that evening ok noticed swollen lymph nodes throughout my scalp, face, ear, jaw, neck and chest.  My eyebrow also started to swell and was slightly pink.  When the swelling was worse the next day - I went to urgent care and saw A doctor that diagnosed me with facial cellulitis.  After a couple days my eye was not getting any better and started to itch severely.  Called to urgent care over the weekend and takes to one of the providers who said to use cold compresses and elevate my head as much as I could.  On Dec. 11, 2021 I called back to the provider I had seen on Dec. 6 - he told me he believed I had developed shingles and to go to the eye doctor that day.  I saw a doctor on Dec. 11 &amp; was diagnosed with shingles.  They started me on antivirals along with the antibiotics they had prescribed on Dec. 6.

On arrival to the emergency department she was found to have wheezing with stridor.  A dose of epinephrine was administered and she was monitored in the emergency department with an initial improvement in symptoms. Approximately one hour and 30 minutes after initial epinephrine administration patient reported that she was having continued difficulty swallowing and she was starting to feel a little worse.  At this point a second dose of IM epinephrine was administered.    The patient was subsequently  admitted to inpatient medicine team for further monitoring.

                                                About 45 minutes to an hour after the administration of the vaccine m, my cheeks became red, hot, and swollen. There were also hives. I took Benadryl which stopped the spreading but it did not go away. I had shortness of breath, and by about 6:00 it was hard to breath when lying down. I did an albuterol treatment with my nebulizer. It helped but it took much longer than usual. There were was about 30 minutes that I found my epipen and was going to the ED if it got worse.  My breathing improved. The red changed to pink but was still swollen and tight 7 hours later. The second one of Benadryl helped get rid of most of the pinkness. When I woke up this morning, I had a little bit of a wheezy cough that I didn?t have yesterday.  My daily Zyrtec and singular helped that a little. I have new hives along my jawline this morning that are very minor but they do itch. The redness and swelling was similar to reactions I?ve gotten when I drink a beer or have eaten soft shell crab, but typically Benadryl will clear that up and it doesn?t linger for so long.  This was more aggressive. My side effects at this point are minor, but I have a call in to my allergist to see if I should be doing anything different and questions about the second dose.

                                                5 days after 2nd covid vaccine, I started experiencing severe pain, with pins/needles sensation.  Started in plantar aspect of both feet and traveled upwards to my hands, in a matter of hours.  Extreme pain in lower back and extremities caused me to go to the ER.  Following lumbar puncture and a series of diagnostic tests, I have started on IVIG for Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy.  This is a subtype of Guillain Barre syndrome, believed to be precipitated by autoimmune response generated from the 2nd covid vaccine.  I am now on day 4 of my hospitalization.

                                                Felt a little fatigue and little tired. It was lymphadenopathy - super clavicle area - above clavicle and neck (above collarbone area) - painful lymph node inflammation - and tender, marble size inflammation. Gradually subsided within four weeks. Today it is very small size now but almost back to normal. I had consulted with a physician because in this area it can be a cancer concern and he said to watch and wait.

                                                Filler swelling (face); This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable other healthcare professional (who is also the patient). A 41-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El9265, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 29Jan2021 17:00, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization, at a public health department. Medical history included hypothyroidism. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiry date: unknown) received at 41 years of age, via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm, on 08Jan2021 17:00, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2 vaccine. On 31Jan2021, the patient experienced filler swelling (face) (pending clarification). It was unknown if treatment was received for the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered. The reporter assessed the event as non-serious.

                                                My left arm (site of injection on a Wednesday) began to ache within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine. I took Tylenol to treat the pain and drank a lot of water. I woke up the next morning at 630am in extremely bad pain. My left lymph node under my arm was extremely swollen and tight, agony to touch. My entire left side from head to fingertips to toes ached at a level of 9 out of 10. My neck aches across both shoulders and my lower back aches across to my right side; the rest of my right side was unaffected. I took Tylenol every 6 hours which dimmed the pain to about a 6, but it would wear off 4.5 hours later, jumping back up to a 9. I eventually started taking Aleve later that evening to help at around 6 pm. I would become warm off and on, running a very low fever. I didn?t have any other symptoms other than the extreme pain, aches, and feeling drained. The next day (Friday) my pain had decreased to a 7.5-8, but my lymph node was still extremely painful and swollen. The pain continued to decrease the next day to a 5; Sunday was the last day of the left side body aches and lymph node swelling. However, the next morning (Monday) I woke to extreme lower back spasms/seizing. I went to the  clinic  at 1pm and was given a shot of Toridol and prescribed Voltaire?s and Flexiril. The doctor had me stay at home until Thursday, but the pain is only now starting to ease today, Saturday, March 6. I still have fleeting aches at the injection shot in my left arm.

                                                Several bug bites that I had started to itch incredibly and swelled into welts. The injection site itched too and was hard. My scalp psoriasis also itched a lot. All of this was Saturday, with night being the worst. The bug bites still itch but less than before. I believe this histamine reaction is related to six wasp stings I got in August 2020. I had a bad reaction to the stings. I have been using a prescription topical steroid ointment on the bites since Saturday, which I got for the wasp stings.

I did about 20 minutes after the shot have a headache, severe arm pain, and then later that evening I had body aches, and the lymph node under my arm swelled up. I am still having the arm pain, swollen lymph node and itching and its 5 days later.  I have been taking my already prescribed allergy medications as well as Benadryl and Claritin as advised by my doctor.

Irritation the more I moved around. swelling  was soft and pliable, no hardness. Monday morning swelling had  decreased significantly. Email my care team on Sunday, Monday response was that swelling may have been attributed to the vaccine and I should file a report with CDC. No other symptoms other than soreness at injection site and body aches that lasted 24 hours.

                                                Within a couple minutes of receiving shot, felt pain at injection site that traveled up arm into neck. Heart rate went up to 122bpm. Left side of face felt puffy and numb. Left side of mouth and tongue were tingling. Reported this to vaccine giver, he had me wait about half an hour before suggesting Benadryl. Half an hour after 25mg Benadryl, symptoms were almost completely resolved.  The next day (3/14) I felt tired. The day after (3/15) I felt hot and my skin was flushed. I was not running a fever. I generally felt unwell that day. I felt better by the time I woke up on 3/16. I also had a bad/metallic taste in my mouth through 3/21, which has resolved.  My nurse practitioner suggested that I take Benadryl before I receive my second vaccine dose on 4/3/21.

Swollen Lymph Nodes so swollen it caused pressure on my ear and pain in outer ear.  My NP could not confirm it was from the vaccine.  They put me on an antibiotic and steroids and no relief .. then ear drops... I still cannot hear out of my ear completely and the Lymph nodes in neck, collar bone and armpits are still there and it&#39;s been 16 days since I had the shot.... I am refusing the second injection because of this.  Nothing on right side of body only on left which is the injection side.

A 42-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 31Dec2020 at 10:15 AM, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthma, allergy, hypothyroidism, and some fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks). Patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant. On 31Dec2020, after ten-15 minutes (10:30 AM) of receiving the vaccine, she was light headed and dizzy with some nausea. Monitored in the emergency room (ER) with high BP 140&#39;s and heart rate (HR) 110s to 120s. After an hour of saline bolus, she was better but she got nasal congestion and swelling of the face with sore throat. On 01Jan2021, after 24 hours, she got some soreness at the injection site with generalized body aches. Also she got some shortness of breath which lead to her asthma attack and difficulty sleeping. On 02Jan2021, after 48hours, she was feeling still light headed with some sore throat, chills, body aches and severe headache which lead her to go to the ER and got herself tested for flu, covid and strep, which came back all negative but her signs and symptoms (s/sx )still after discharge was getting worst especially the headache and generalized body aches. As well as congestion and sore throat. The patient had given &#34;Ivf&#34; for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 48 hours after vaccination, I developed tender and swollen lymphadenopathy from my axilla down the bottom of my arm to my elbow on my right side. This is the same side the injection was given. The injection site is no longer tender to touch but it is difficult to raise my arm and hold it straight due to discomfort. My arm is visibly swollen compared to my left arm. I can feel shotty lymph nodes down my arm.

Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

A 42-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 23Dec2020 h 09:00 intramuscularly in left deltoid (left arm) lot number: EK5730 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications were not provided. Patient stated that she has had double mastectomy, and missing a lot of lymph nodes, states she got the first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 23Dec2020, states it made her left subclavian lymph nodes swollen and hard. States that when she gets the flu vaccine at her hospital every year, she gets swollen lymph nodes ever since she had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. She originally was wondering if she could get the vaccine in another large muscle group. States she even went as far as to cross reference flu shot ingredients with the Pfizer Covid ingredients to see if something in the vaccines were causing the swollen lymph nodes but was unable to come to any conclusion, the only think in common is the Sodium Chloride and she does not feel like that would cause any issue. States the swollen lymph nodes occurred after the Sanofi brand flu vaccine (no other information known or provided). Patient is on day 15 post vaccination and they are still swollen and hard, she is wondering if there is any data on how long this side effect can last. She made an appointment with her oncologist, she knows that the swollen lymph had the first dose, lymph nodes are still swollen and hard, knows it can cause swollen lymph nodes but wants to know what is the typically length of the event. Patient also experienced other side effects, on 30Dec2020 (last week), she developed vertigo that lasted through the weekend intermittently, states she at first thought she was having a stroke. States it seems to have subsided as of 05Jan2021 (yesterday). Patient also reported she had an itchy rash twice as part of her side effects reported from the COVID 19 vaccine. She noticed an itchy rash and it went away but she is unsure exactly the day or time. Stated she definitely remembered the rash on 28Dec2020 as she took pictures. It was gone in about three hours on the same day. She did not treat the rash because it was gone and not itching. The rash came and went and had not come back. It was mostly on the bends of the arms, bilateral arms. Patient reported developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area the day after the injection, on 24Dec2020. They were not as tender at the time of the report but were continuing and this was 15 days from her vaccination. Patient also experienced an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms that occurred twice and only lasted a few hours each time, onset date reported as 25Dec2020. She was advised to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for it however she did not take it. On 23Dec2020 patient experienced headache. On 24Dec2020 patient experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes and runny nose. On 30Dec2020 patient experienced joint pain and muscle and vertigo. The events headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms were considered serious as medically significant events. Patient had not recovered from swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, joint pain and muscle, extreme fatigue and swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area, she was recovering from headache, runny nose and vertigo and recovered completely from an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Causality between the events, headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms, and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine cannot be denied based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

Overnight, I started to experience chills followed by extreme perspiration and weakness to the point that I struggled to open a bottle of water I had by my bed.  Tuesday, 1/12/2021:                       Headache, weak and tired but attempted to work.  I had to leave shortly after arriving because my symptoms were becoming progressively worse to the point I almost passed out from standing.  Upon arriving home, I started to experience nausea and vomiting x 3. Intense chills followed by the extreme perspiration still existed.  Most of these symptoms subsided by 9:30p that evening.  Wednesday, 1/13/2021:                Intense headache, weakness and dizziness.  Of note, my left underarm/armpit (the arm where the vaccine was administered) is sensitive to touch.

I took Tylenol every 6 hrs for about 36 hrs.  My fever &#34;broke&#34; and didn&#39;t return in the middle of the night on day 2.  After that (so on day 2) my arm is still sore and I developed a red swollen, itchy rash about the size of my fist on my shoulder.  I also have lymphadenopathy in the arm pit area that is making the whole arm and down that side sore and painful.

This 42-year-old female nurse (patient) reported for herself that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot#: nurse stated she thought she had a lot# it looked like EK5703), via unspecified route at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (patient had taken blood pressure medicine but hadn&#39;t taking currently because her blood pressure was being controlled). Concomitant medications included unspecified vitamins. Patient was tested positive for Covid on the 29Dec2020. She stated she didn&#39;t know about causality, she was saying no but she did have swollen lymph nodes under the right arm before getting sick (Dec2020), now she thought that might get from her vaccination but in her understanding she could get it from Covid so, she couldn&#39;t answer that, she tested positive, she didn&#39;t think it&#39;s from vaccination but her concern was because she had got the vaccination the first one then had the (Covid) infection and right now she should get the second one or not. Regarding treatment, patient stated she was taking methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL) and salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler, taking over the counter Vitamin D3, Zinc and Vitamin C and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). Patient reported she did go to the physician office/ emergency room. Outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (8 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between events &#34;Tested positive for Covid/had the (Covid) infection&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / COVID-19) and  swollen lymph nodes and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                45 minutes after given the vaccine. Severe dizziness, stumbling, couldn&#39;t see straight,  Had somewhat similar reaction to the first dose went down to the Emergency room on 12/31/20. They treated it as vertigo. gave zofran for nausea and valium to calm me down. Was sent home with Meclizine (motion sickness)meds. I am at 9 days after the vaccine administration and still having the vertigo and nausea due to being dizzy. I didn&#39;t go to the emergency room right away as I was treating it as they treated the first one. I fell asleep as soon as I got home from work at 130pm. I got the second dose at 0900 on 1/21/21. Fell asleep for several hours. Could barely wake up. Hands and feet were swollen. Couldn&#39;t make fists. Feet were tight. Stayed hydrated. since then for the past week I have been taking motion sickness meds the dizziness has not gone away. Went to the Emergency room on 1/28/21 as the symptoms still haven&#39;t gone away. They ruled me out for a stroke. I felt completely normal before the vaccine. I had CT scan done, MRI both came back normal. The diagnosis that was the outcome was vertigo.

All of Saturday these symptoms went on and I had a tightness in my throat, not pain.  I was very delirious and speaking jibberish when awake.  Sunday the fever lessened and I felt more alert, but a large swelling started in my armpit in the left arm.  Monday the fever was gone but I still had major joint pain, off and on headache and overall sick feeling.  Today I woke and have a very upset stomach and achy feeling all over.  The lump in my arm pit has gotten smaller but is still painful and visible.

                                                1/29/21 Friday night:  Muscle in upper arm knotted up so bad it pinched the nerve and my arm was useless.  I had muscle weakness and joint pain down to my wrist. I had to do old physical therapy exercises, ice pack on upper arm, and took tylenol (really wanted to take advil). Saturday evening:  I discovered my lymph gland was swollen and very sore under my left arm.  Took a hot shower and it helped.  As long as I don&#39;t wear a regular bra it&#39;s ok.  Sore to touch or if I moved my arm a lot. Tylenol (again with the advil)and  heating pad.  Still sore today.  Creeps me out. I also, slept all day Saturday.  Took a long nap Sunday.  Went to the clinic on Monday, back to another clinic on Tuesday-Tuesday was when I had the extreme exhaustion.  I napped for 3 hours in the afternoon and was so tired and woozy when I woke up.  I had brain fog.  Couldn&#39;t concentrate or care about much for awhile.  Today, I slept in, and feel fineat the moment.  Waiting to see if I have that nap exhaustion thing.  I plan to walk some and go pick up some Vitamin C and Zinc supplements today.

                                                After receiving dose one on Saturday Jan 30 2021 I was okay and a few days later about a week I noticed swelling and redness on my left arm where the shot was administered. It itches really bad. I scratched it several times and then put rubbing alcohol on it to ease the itchiness. Currently my left arm is still red and swollen and itchy.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; not able to breathe or talk; Her throat was closing up; This is a spontaneous report from contactable pharmacists and an other hcp and a nurse. A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EN5318) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 15:15 in right deltoid at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included high blood pressure medication. Patient was not able to breathe or talk. Her throat was closing up. They had to use epinephrine to help her breath. It was reported as anaphylactic reaction. The vaccine was administered at 15:15, patient was interacting with HCPs who asked basic questions and at some point (15:17) patient was not responsive, patient was not able to breath and talk. All events started from 25Jan2021 15:17. Patient was administered Epipen (also reported as Benadryl and Epinephrine) and &#34;she came back&#34;. Patient was taken to hospital. Patient refused to call an ambulance. She was taken to hospital. The patient was not seen in the Emergency Department. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. Unknown if covid tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient has not received any other vaccines around the time of bnt162b2 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included heart rate with result of went up as soon as epipen was administered, O2 saturation and vitals with unknown results, all on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk.

That evening, I noticed chills, pressure at the top of my head, sensitivity to sounds, and aching body.  That night, I had trouble sleeping due to all of this. The next day, an additional thing I noticed was how much my lymph nodes hurt, especially in the throat and armpits. The left armpit in particular was more swollen and painful than at any other time in my life. I could not put my arm down without pain. The day after that, the feelings subsided. This 3rd day after the shot, my left armpit lymph node is a little sore, but  I am able to do my daily activities. I took children&#39;s chewable aspirin tablets the first evening, day and 2nd evening.

                                                Immediately following the vaccination, I had some site pain. I felt tired that evening and went to bed early, sleeping well (Wednesday night). Approximately 20 hours after receiving my 2nd vaccine (10am Thursday), I developed a low fever (99`), extreme lethargy, chills, and overall body aches. These symptoms lasted approximately 13 hours. When my fever broke (approximately midnight Thursday), the body aches and chills went away as well. The next day (Friday), I woke up to significant arm pain, severe headache, tingles in my arm, swollen lymph nodes in my arm pit and neck, as well as a rash on my upper arm around the injection site. These symptoms persisted until Sunday. The rash and swollen lymph nodes disappeared Sunday night/Monday morning. Since Monday, however, the headaches, arm pain, and some tingles in my arm have persisted all week. Motrin curbs the pain of the headaches and arm pain, but as it wears off the pain resurfaces.

This 42-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN9581) on 02Feb2021 at 10:30, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The first BNT162B2 vaccine dose was administered on 12Jan2021 at 13:30, lot number EL3246, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart murmur, acute sinusitis, allergies to acetaminophen/oxycodone (PERCOCET), cephalexin (KEFLEX), codeine, trees, pollen, grass, mold, cats, some dogs. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and COVID was not tested after vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the second vaccine dose on 02Feb2021 at the hospital and was monitored for 30 minutes. Within that time her tongue started to be tingly, she experienced fuzzy feeling, tongue swollen a bit with hives, hard to swallow, weird taste in mouth. The nurse on staff walked her to the ED, she was admitted and treated for allergic reaction to the vaccine and received prednisone for 5 days and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). Epipen if needed. Later that night, on 02Feb2021, the patient had a high grade fever over 103, chills uncontrollably, heart racing a bit, could not lift arm/move body, joint-muscle pain, headache, dizziness, swollen lymphnodes, hard to swallow, every side effect on sheet just really bad. Her fever eventually went down on 03Feb2021 to 102, 101, 99, then 98.6. She still had all other symptoms not as severe, later that night she had a bit of a red rash on chest/arms/stomach with some hives, swallowing was still a bit hard. She continued to take BENADRYL and steroid. 06Feb2021 was her last day of steroid. As of 06Feb2021 she was feeling a bit better with no fever, swallowing a bit hard but other symptoms were less. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Fever resolved on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The other events were resolving.

                                                I had the injection at 1000 am. At 8pm, I had chills, fever (Tmax 101), body aches, bone pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph node under my right arm. For about 4 hours, I could barely move because I was in so much pain. These symptoms continued, but after the four hours, was a little better. I still had significant symptoms for another day and a half. The symptoms slowly decreased until gone. I was off of work for 3 days. No treatment outside of OTC Tylenol, Aleve, ice pack, and rest.

                                                After I received the 2nd vaccine I experienced chills and fatigue for two days. 2 weeks after the 2nd dose I got a rash of tiny bumps starting around my neck and then spread across my entire body including my scalp. I had inflamed lymph nodes and a cyst near the lymph node was inflamed. The rash continued. I went to my family dr and she gave me 4 days of 20mg prednisone. That helped some. After I finished the medication the rash was healing  and then I started having hives that covered my entire body. I am also having &#39;hotspots&#39; that flare up daily. I have had at least 25 hotspots. my skin stays severely dry no matter what I try. I went back to the dr when the hives started and she gave me a heavy taper down series of prednisone. while it has helped some my body still has hotpots, under the skin is prickly, tingly, and my skin acts like it has been sunburned is is peeling off. I have sores and raw spots randomly over my body. I am also using benadryl to help.

A 42-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 19Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3249) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included post-partum hypothyroidism. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 29Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient stated &#34;The day after second vaccine and that week, I had chills, aches, fever 101, left neck and chest swollen lymph nodes, stomach aches. 28Jan2021, I started having severe left flank pain and abdominal pain. On 04Feb2021, I had a heart attack, was in V-fib arrest, and subsequently found to have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which caused 3 artery dissections and narrowing of other arteries. Did not know I had FMD prior to the heart attack. Most people who have FMD never show signs or symptoms and don&#39;t know they have it. Others with FMD have it affect maybe one artery. Something caused my FMD to go into overdrive, affecting 3 arteries. It also affected a renal artery, causing lack of blood to my left kidney, causing part of that kidney to die - that was my 28Jan2021 pain. Coincidental my FMD acted up this way a little over a week after receiving the second Pfizer shot?&#34; Events were reported as serious and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient hospitalization for 9 days. Treatment received for all events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test (Nasal Swab): negative on an unknown date (Covid test post vaccination). The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

I saw the cardiologist who believed it to be sinus tackycardia as a result as an AE to  vaccine.  Felt as if my face and lips were swelling  so I took benedry and laid down again and the next morning  when I woke up and my face and lips were super swollen.  But by the 3rd day the symptoms began to subside a little.  By the 24th my HR had balanced out and I only had residual swelling around the eye area.

A 43-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), birth control. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for GERD, estradiol pills for birth control. The patient got the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and she had some pretty severe flu like symptoms afterwards in Jan2021. But she noticed something odd and that was her armpit was swollen. She thought that is listed as one of the side effects but she wanted to know more about it. She had a pneumococcal vaccine (Unspecified vaccine) reaction and she wanted to make sure that there was nothing that would cross reactivity associated with this vaccine (Covid19 Vaccine). The weight is like 160. About 10 hours, she got 2 or 3 symptoms. Fever, aches, headache, bad headache. That lasted about overnight on the 05Jan2021. Swelling in the arm only started on 06Jan2021. That was when the armpit got swollen. The outcome of the events were unknown.

Next several days feeling extra tired especially in the evenings. On 1/12 I got up at 05:30 feeling fatigued and super tired, i call out work. I slept for most of the day and called occupational health (OH) and they scheduled a PCR Covid test for the next day 1/13, which came back negative. (1/14) still feeling fatigued, having palpitations and noticed my heart rate increasing significantly with mild exertion such as walking and eating, so I reached out to my PCP, who ordered labs and a second PCR Covid test for 1/15. Labs returned the next day 1/15 with elevated WBC and second Covid test came back negative on 1/16. Felt a bit better on Sunday 1/17, but today 1/18, I am still very tired and my heart continues to increase when I get out of bed, eat, shower or do any simple thing, my heart rate jumps from 64-68 to 115-120s,  called my PCP back and he is seeing me tomorrow morning for an EKG and other tests, and I have been out of work for a week. I take no prescriptions drugs and have no health problems.

                                                Within 30 minutes of shot-Fleeting itching in both ears, fingertips, and soles of feet.  Blurred peripheral vision in left eye only.  Dizziness, wooziness.  All resolved with 35 minutes of injection, initially. Within 4 hours of shot-Exponential increase in pain from waist down, including lower back pain.  Took Motrin 600 mgs which resolved pain within 1 hour of taking it.  Felt off/not myself-Felt foggy-headed-pressure in head and ears was not normal.  2100-0000 (Evening of shot)-Moderate sporadic dizziness that became moderate constant dizziness-Took 1 25 mg chewable Meclizine with 1 cup of water.  Pain increased and Motrin wore off.  Fatigue grew worse.  1/13/21-1/14/21-SEVERE back pain.  Intense pain in legs and hips.  Upper respiratory symptoms-Nasal congestion, ear pressure, sinus pain/pressure, chest and upper back discomfort, chest congestion, irritation, and aching.  Cheeks and nose looked puffy/swollen.  Eye pain, headache on and off.  Fatigue, dragging.  Felt feverish but no actual fever.  Body aches-sides, legs-front, back, and sides, lower back, and glutes.  Felt like arthritis from waist down, including lower back.  Took nighttime cold syrup, etc. to be able to sleep and/or at least dull the pain.  Also used heating massage pad to assist with pain relief. 1/15/21-1/16/21-Pain lessened in terms of intensity.  Had longer spells of less intense pain.  Also less pain with movement after resting/lying down.  However, pain still intense at this point.  Meds more helpful with the pain at this point as well.  On Sat, felt dizzy and unwell all day, including extra tired.  Hot, sweaty on Sat.  Racing heart, chest tightness.  Used inhaler and Metoprolol. 1/17/21-Felt unwell-intense pain still, dizziness, fatigue.  Took Meclizine 25 mg that morning.  Also took another 25 mg Meclizine later that afternoon.  Nausea, dry heaving to the point I almost vomited 2x.  After napping, nausea returned slightly but immediately went away.  Felt very tired remainder of the evening. 1/18/21-Went to MD to get clearance to return to work.  Dizziness prior to visit and took 1/2 25 mg Meclizine.  Felt better until I got to doctor&#39;s office.  While waiting to be called back, dizziness started up again and got severe.  While waiting on MD to come in and talk to me, I got nauseated and felt like I might dry heave/vomit.  I took another 1/2 Meclizine 25 mg and sucked on a mentholated cough drop to help with nausea, which did subside.  Dizziness continued to be severe.  MD took blood pressure, pulse ox, checked my ears, checked my pupils, listened to me breathe, asked me about my symptoms, return to work, and advised on safety of taking 2nd COVID injection when it is time but leaving it up to me in terms of if I feel benefits outweigh possible side effects of 2nd injection.  He prescribed anti-nausea meds, pain meds, and stated he wants to see me for a follow-up visit in 1 week.  He also prescribed steroid and pain med injections to be administered in office immediately, steroid injection sometimes contains Benadryl and based on how I felt after the shot, there may have been Benadryl in this one.  He also requested I message him later in the day to let him know how I was feeling.  Injections did GREATLY assist with pain and dizziness/foggy-headed feeling, once they kicked in.  I did message him letting him know how I was feeling after napping. 1/18/21 evening-I am still feeling weak and tired and having stinging like pain in both legs along with minor lower back pain.  Some chest and throat irritation as well as stomach discomfort.  Going to take a gentle laxative as well as some of the nighttime cold medicine I purchased.  Still also having dizziness on and off.  I plan to return to work tentatively, on 1/19/21, per my return to work note from MD.  I will keep my MD notified of how I feel between now and next Monday&#39;s follow-up.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

It alarmed me. I have also had diarrhea since the day of vaccine and just feel over all flushed and very sleepy/tired.

A 43-year-old female patient received one dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via unspecified route single dose for protection from COVID-19 2 o&#39; clock or 3 yesterday (09Jan2020), at 43-year-old. Medical history included: multiple sclerosis. Concomitant medication included: sertraline 50 mg once daily at night; antidepressant (unspecified). The patient previously took glatiramer acetate (COPAXONE) once for multiple sclerosis and amantadine, was allergic to both. The patient didn&#39;t notice soreness on the side of her face, was probably from the vaccine started yesterday (09Jan2020). The patient was doing fine but then noticing was getting swelling in her lymph nodes on the right side. The patient did not notice the swelling, but she noticed the discomfort first last night (09Jan2020), &#39;9th, 10 pm&#39; (not clarified further). The patient thought that it was a &#39;pimple&#39; (not further clarified) there. And then later today (10Jan2020), or just maybe an hour ago, when she felt that on her neck, she found lymph nodes swollen. So far, no treatment was taken. No lab work done. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was resolved.

Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and her arm was inflamed, and so swollen, she couldn&#39;t move it. Caller was instructed to call after getting the COVID vaccine. She had a reaction after the vaccine. Her doctor said to call Pfizer. It was after she received the 2nd dose of the vaccine, Saturday (09Jan2021). She had a reaction. She developed a headache and fatigue. She had had these side effects since Saturday. They have lasted Sunday, Monday, and today/Tuesday. She was very tired, and she has generalized body pain. The pain was in her arm, shoulders, knees, spines, scapula&#39;s, hips, hands, legs, feet, and back. Literally, her whole body was so painful. She had been taken Ibuprofen 800mg and Tylenol 1g. She had been taking those every 8 hours. She took them together. When she took them, her headache and body pain was maybe a 5-6/10. If she didn&#39;t take the Ibuprofen and Tylenol her body pain and headache was probably an 8/10 pain. She also had swollen lymph nodes in her left arm pit. Which is the arm they injected the vaccine into. She just noticed it Saturday night. She couldn&#39;t move her arm. Now, after the second, she had a swollen lymph node the size of a quarter. It had been the same size since Saturday. She was wondering if it would go away? She was also becoming forgetful. Her brain was foggy-ongoing. Like she forgot her doctors appointment today. The outcome of event &#34;brain was foggy&#34; was not resolved while outcome of other events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Started to feel ?out of body?, slow and had left-sided chest pain at around 8 minutes after administration. Then flagged down a nurse. They checked my blood pressure at 196/110 (first one may have been 210/110)- I was sort of disoriented. Sat there for about an hour with repeated blood pressure checks, until my pulse went from 118 down to 90. They let me go home at 170/100. I do t have hypertension. Then went and laid down in my office nearby and my left upper arm turned bright red and became painful and slightly swollen. Took five hours for my blood pressure to drop to 118/80- my normal is 114/78. Still have weird chest pain and some SOB with exertion (not normal for me).

                                                Swelling of lymph node in right armpit originally. Swelling and fluid spread - filling right side of body, across right collar bone, halfway down torso and slightly around the back. It also spread down the right arm halfway to elbow. The on-call nurse originally thought it could be cellulitis but after being told there was no redness or itchiness, she was unsure of the diagnosis and suggested to talk with the on-call doctor or go to the ER. The on-call doctor really had no idea as to what was going on. Once at the ER, the doctor checked with other doctors and read as much as he could about this type of reaction. Nothing he read matched up exactly with what was going on. He did note some swelling of lymph nodes had been reported but not to this extent. With all this being new, he suggested to go home and watch the swelling and come back if things got worse. For several days, there continued to be no redness or itchiness. The discomfort was only in the lymph node in the right armpit, with some slight pressure from the skin tightening around the fluid on the arm. Within a week, the welling was completely gone and the lymph node discomfort lasted a couple days more.     I feel it necessary to note that I don&#39;t believe the shot was given in the correct location. As soon as the needle entered the skin, my thought was &#39;that is too high&#39; and there was a pain like I have never felt with a vaccine before. That pain subsided shortly after the injection but it was several days before the injection site felt better. Now, two weeks later, I have a constant pain in my shoulder, slightly down my arm and into my collar bone area. There are also times when the pain throbs or shoots through as well.  I believe this pain may be due to the placement of the shot, and not necessarily from the vaccine itself.

She felt feverish, chills that night but did not check temperature. Over next few days, she developed increasing generalized body aches, joint aches, headaches, weakness, fatigue. On 1/21/21 pt noted SOB and chest tightness, so she reported to  ED. She checked her pulse ox and was 99%, was tachycardic to 140-150. She takes propranolol for essential tremor, so she took propranolol 40 mg PO x 1 and presented to ED on 1/21/21.  In ED, pt was no longer tachycardic. Pt also states her concern for blood clot (mother had DVT in her 30s). She presented with moderate chest pain and tightness, as well as headache, weakness, SOB. Pt given APAP 1000 mg PO x 1, ibuprofen 800 mg PO x 1, orphenadrine 100 mg PO x 1. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL x 1 ordered, but not given on MD&#39;s orders. Pt discharged home.  1/22/21: Pt f/u with hospital. DO says her elevated WBX and Cr were likely d/t vaccine and dehydration. DO offered to schedule f/u BMP and CBC on Monday 1/25. Pt also scheduled for outpt fluids at infusion center on Monday 1/25 in case BMP and CBC still indicate dehydration.

                                                New and worsened reaction to food allergy/intolerance. After 20 years of small bites, I have  built some immunity to certain foods. Since I received my vaccine I have had strong reactions to foods I usually tolerate with mild oral itching in very small portions. The first increased reaction was around 2 weeks after my first shot.  About 2 hours after eating a very small portion of avocado, I woke up with a start with extreme tightness of my chest and gasping for air. I caught my breath after a few seconds then projectile vomited. Treated with 50mg Benadryl and returned to sleep after 45 minutes. I have never had any respiratory symptoms with a food allergy reactions. About 2 weeks after my second shot I accidentally ate a few bites of tomato which has not been a problem for over 10 years. After vomiting in my car and pulling off the road I saw my cervical lymph nodes were swollen to about 1.5 inches in diameter. I have never seen any thing like it. My airway was clear. I took 25mg of Benadryl, waited for 30 minutes, then drove home. I had a similar experience 3 weeks after my second shot with a fresh/homemade pickle that apparently was too raw. Vomiting with mildly swollen cervical lymph nodes treated with 25 mg Benadryl

The patient experienced mild anaphylactic reaction on 16Jan2021 at 20:00 and itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss on an unspecified date. The patient reported that all the progress she made with taste and smell, disappeared after the vaccine and was actually worse than when she got COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild anaphylactic reaction, which included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The clinical outcome of mild anaphylactic reaction was not recovered and of itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

                                                felt a painful lump/mass under left arm (axillary) the day after receiving the vaccine 1/12/2021. I had an office visit on 1/14*2021 because I continue to have arm pit swelling with tenderness. I was alternating between motrin or Tylenol around the clock for several days and pain was relieved with pain medication. Dr. provided breast examination and determined could be lymph node swelling caused by the vaccine and we should wait 1 more week for further eval. She said if swelling still there would order an ultrasound, luckily at day 5 sunday 1/17/2021 I finally felt no more swelling or pain. no further exams needed and a few weeks later heard on the news this situation was becoming more common with vaccine administration.

A 43-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm in the morning of 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing complex regional pain syndrome, ongoing fibromyalgia, ongoing arthritis - all diagnosed 20 years ago. Her mother has lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and she can&#39;t have the vaccine, states she doesn&#39;t know if something could be genetic. Low potassium in the past and stated that she has a lot of allergies to medications, but she consulted with the pharmacist and he said it would be okay. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccine was administered on the same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient was having weird symptoms and she tried looking online and in different groups to find out if anyone has similar symptoms, but she hasn&#39;t been able to find anything. She began by saying she has health issues; she has Fibromyalgia and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. She doesn&#39;t know if studies were performed on patients with those disorders that took the vaccine. It&#39;s been about 3 weeks since getting the vaccine (Apr2021) and she started having symptoms that she thought could be a blood clot. From the knees down, she was having a lot of pain, cramps, burning from her calf to her feet. She would keep rubbing them and massaging them. It was excruciating pain. She was having symptoms and she did go see her Nurse Practitioner on 14Apr2021 because she thought she was having a stroke or a clot or something in her legs or that she was having a problem with her cholesterol. The nurse thought maybe it was her electrolytes, because she had low potassium in the past, but everything came back normal. Her feet were painful but not as bad in Apr2021. She felt like her condition but it&#39;s flaring up like 200% it&#39;s like over a 10 on the pain scale. She can&#39;t think right, she can&#39;t work, and was very uncomfortable in Apr2021. The leg pain felt like it is really deep in the vein, it doesn&#39;t feel like it is superficial, and she can feel stuff or liquid flowing. Her pain alternates from her head to her neck to her feet and it is very uncomfortable. Her hands and feet started to go numb, not completely numb but like when they fall asleep from sitting on them and then hit something and it hurts. Her arms were burning like crazy; they itch, they burn in Apr2021. Different temperatures like hot and cold make it painful, bad and irritating, and she can&#39;t sleep well because of her symptoms. She doesn&#39;t know the exact dates, but it has been about a week, but it is changing. It started with cramps in her legs from her knees down. That is where she had injuries and she thought it was her cholesterol. From her knees down, she has cramps and pain and it is very uncomfortable, she felt a really deep pain. She has pain in her neck then to her back, it started in her lower extremities and it is going up. It has stayed the same and she has to keep taking Tylenol to control the pain. Her symptoms got worse and she started taking Tylenol and that helped and then on 15Apr2021, her hands and feet started going numb and she had a headache and pain on the top portion of her head (reported as brain) and her hands hurt, and she was nauseous. She hasn&#39;t heard back from the nurse practitioner, so she decided not to go and get it done because she felt it is from the vaccine. She also has swelling of feet in Apr2021, and now she just woke up an hour ago and she slept somewhat okay, but she had to take Tylenol. Now that she is standing, it felt like her legs are starting to hurt again. Treatment included Tylenol, which helps a little and she has to keep taking it. If she doesn&#39;t take Tylenol, she can&#39;t even function. The events from the knees down I was having a lot pain/leg pain felt like it is really deep in the vein, cramps, my hands and feet started going numb, they itch they burn, feet are painful, uncomfortable, pain on the top of my head and my hands hurt/headache, swelling in her feet, nauseous, pain in her neck then to her back, different temperatures like hot and cold make it bad and irritating had not resolved, while the event can&#39;t sleep well because of her symptoms was resolving, and the outcome rest of the events was unknown.

A non-pregnant 43-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Feb2021 at 18:00 (at the age of 43 years old) (Lot Number: EM9809, unknown expiration) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included penicillin allergy.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient also received first dose of BNT162B2 on 23Jan2021 at 18:00 (at the age of 43 years old) (lot number: EL3247, unknown expiration) in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. After the second shot, the patient did notice swollen lymph nodes on 02Apr2021 for several days.  She noticed her breathing labored while walking or doing activity on 02Apr2021 after getting the second shot. In 8 weeks, the patient went to the ER and found that she had fluid built up around heart and lungs which started on 02Apr2021.  They also found in a CT scan that lymph nodes were enlarged slightly and that the patient&#39;s white blood count was elevated on 02Apr2021. After an echocardiogram on 02Apr2021, they determined that the patient&#39;s heart was weak and only working at 29% percent.  The patient has had no prior history of heart problems or was taking any medications. The patient was given many heart medications to strengthen the heart and treatment for the events. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient has no COVID and was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab on 10Apr2021 with negative result. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalization) for 8 days.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

My right arm felt painful similar to receiving a tetanus shot, I took some Tylenol and drank some coffee and felt better. However, the feeling of heaviness in my legs continued. On Sunday, my left leg continued to swell and I noticed that the area under my knee cap and above the upper part of the rim of my socks was visible swollen, red, and painful.  I took some Motrin and the swelling improved. Later, I noticed I am having musculoskeletal pain and general body aches that improve with Mortin but returns. I am able to continue with my ADLs

A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included cutaneous t-cell lymphoma from 2017 and ongoing, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing thyroid, covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date not ongoing (lasted about 1-1.5 months; she did not have any breathing problems) and blood cancer. Concomitant medication included bexarotene ongoing for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rosuvastatin ongoing for cholesterol, levothyroxine ongoing for thyriod. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID 19: positive in Nov2020, found out tested positive around holiday. Clinical course: onset about 26 hours after administered the first dose; onset as soon as she got back to work next day: 06Jan2021. The side effects were at their worst for at least 24-48 hours. Further described as all side effects occurred only on left side of her body: whole left side of face swelled up on 06Jan2021; left eye turned red on 06Jan2021; whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb on 05Jan2021; eye went black/left eye looked bruised on 05Jan2021; pressure in head on 06Jan2021; felt like someone squeezing her eyeball out on 06Jan2021, within the first 24-48 hours, her &#39;left leg went numb&#39;. She called to talk to physician and nurse who advised her to take Benadryl; which she did take and the Benadryl stopped the side effects; but she could not take a lot of Benadryl or anything because she was at work. She stayed at work because at least there were healthcare professionals, adults in case she passed out; at home she has 7 young children and is also raising her grandchild. The side effects did not completely go away. The arm thing was normal; The next day she was at work and had the swelling on left side of face; blackness around the eyes; arriving home she had headaches on 07Jan2021 and then her leg went numb for like 20 mins; the whole left side of her body went numb including even her vagina; left side of her body was so numb and weird and tingly feeling that she started panicking because she was driving on 06Jan2021. She calmed herself down thinking it&#39;s only the left side; you can drive with your right side to get home and be fine. It was more like left side of her body was asleep, tingling, she has never had that happen before. Everything else like the headache, flu feeling was about 48 hours later (on 07Jan2021). She had COVID already back in Nov2020 for about 1-1.5 months; the next side effects she had were like the COVID symptoms she had, like the chills and everything on 06Jan2021. She had the lethargic feeling again, her head was hurting, she felt extremely weak on 06Jan2021. Patient also felt nausea on 06Jan2021, Dizzy on 08Jan2021. Another doctor said it sounded like the side effects she experienced with the vaccine sounded like allergic reaction or Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient was asking the doctor if she could get like an Epi-pen or prescription Benadryl or something because she is afraid to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and not have something to respond to side effects with. The outcome of event whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb was recovered on 07Jan2021, for headaches was recovering, chills and nausea was recovered on 08Jan2021. Outcome of other events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

It was very sore and painful to touch and movement. Pain scale 7/10. I treated it with warm compress infused with lavender oil, Ibuprofen 400 mg orally, self-massage, and rest. Symptoms lasted 24 hours. After 24 hours the lymph node was still swollen with dissipated soreness and pain. Pain scale 0-1/10.

                                                2nd shot: Very different experience. Got the shot in my left arm after work like before. I had a headache and felt tired so took some melatonin, had a hot toddy, and went to bed early. Woke up roughly 18 hours post vaccine with back aches and lower rib pain when I took a breath. Took my temp, it was 100*.  By 21 hours I had a temp of 102*.  My groin, neck, and left arm pit lymph nodes were enlarged as well. After sleeping most of the day away, it felt like my fever &#39;broke&#39; at 28 hours, it came down to 101*.  Finally I took some Tylenol at 34 hours so I could sleep from the back pain.  Woke up the next morning at 45 hours with a stiff back/neck but temp down to 99*.  I also had a swollen and reddened entire deltoid where the shot had been given (painless when shot given and no blood after), almost like a cellulitis or allergic reaction.  My left armpit lymph node remains enlarged but not as painful. Now almost 72 hours out, the only residual effects are a decreasing but enlarged left armpit lymph node, improving swollen/reddened deltoid, decreased appetite, and decreased energy level.

                                                I woke up earlier that usual , I had a terrible headache and by lateral tenatis. I felt dizzy and my left arm all the way to the finger was swollen. I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

The second day following the vaccination I woke up with a swollen face and later on in the day my hands started swelling a lot. On the third day in my feet swell very little compared to my hands. I took benadryl which seemed to help. I have an appointment with my pcp tomorrow to get checked out. Today is day 5 and my hands are still swollen but the severity has lessened over the day today. I am very itchy all over my body.

At approximately midnight woke up with severe chills, fever (103) , Body pain, Severe eye pain and nausea. Developed a headache and sweating throughout the night. Continued to administer Tylenol at regular intervals. Sweating was profuse in that pajamas needed to be changed twice. At this point it has been more than 24 hours and though the symptoms have reduced in severity, eyes are still very sore and still experiencing chills and low-grade fever off and on. I would?ve gone into urgent care but there was a huge snowstorm. The reaction was quite concerning and very surprising. There was literally only a sore arm and mildly at that from the first injection .

On 2/1/2021 Monday 10:00am) my left armpit was swollen and sore. You could visibly see the swelling. It was about the size of a lemon.  I contacted my doctor who said the reaction was normal, but I wanted to report it because it was an adverse reaction. The swelling went down but is not gone, as of today, Wednesday 2/3/2021.  I sent my doctor pictures as he is not seeing clients in person.

Symptoms began to ease in the evening with full recovery to baseline 1/31.  2/1  05:00 Upon waking, I noticed I could feel cold sores beginning on my lips. I occasionally experience A SINGLE cold sore after extreme exposure to elements, but not usually after illness. This morning I could feel MANY cold sore forming on my lips (top and bottom) as well as insides of my cheeks and gums. I can count at least 15 different sores that all came on simultaneously.  Treating sores as usual with frankincense and balm to reduce cracking and bleeding. Sores taking usual clinical course, not healed yet.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable other healthcare professional (who is also the patient). A 44-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL0142, expiry date unknown), intramuscular in the left arm, on 05Jan2021 17:30, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, at the hospital. Medical history included asthma and high cholesterol. The patient has no allergy to medications, foot or other products. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) and ethinylestradiol, norgestrel (CRYSELLE). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient experienced upper left swollen lymph nodes (4) on 08Jan2021 13:30. The patient postponed 2nd shot until this is resolved. Ultrasound was done and was told biopsy was needed next.

My neck and underarm are still achy and enlarged.  My body is still sore and I have not been able to continue with my daily activities. I have not felt like this since I had mono as a 19 year old. I have 5 children and have gone through natural childbirth 3 times. I?ve received all my vaccinations faithfully and have never in my life reacted this way.  I am not getting the second dose until I have blood work done to see how my high my antibody levels are.  I respect and am grateful for your work However I need to see data on my body?s reaction to even consider getting another dose.

                                                The morning after my injection, I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my neck (on the left side) and at the base of my skull (in the back on the left side). I also had swollen tonsils. Additionally, the muscles in my shoulder, neck and head (on the left side- where I was given the injection) were tense and painful. It hurt to move them despite stretching them, massaging my shoulder and neck, applying ice to the areas to lower the swelling (for several hours), and ibuprophen. I am also fatigued, but I am told that this is a &#34;normal&#34; reaction to the vaccine. It is the second day and the swelling in my lymph nodes is less than yesterday, although they are still swollen, and the pain in my neck and shoulder is not as painful, but I still cannot turn my head quickly, and it is so stiff in the back of my neck that it hurts to lean my head back. I can lean my head back, but I have to take it very slowly, otherwise there is shooting pain.

                                                Severe body aches started at 4:00am, could not get comfortable. Only thing that helped aches was the bath tub. Didn?t take temperature until 9:00am 100.9.  Husband gave me Advil &amp; Tylenol.  Stomach ache/nausea came next, didn?t feel like eating. Very painful back ache shortly after that. Temperature kept fluctuating all day (due to Tylenol use). The next day (today 3-1-2021), I felt better, so I went to work.  I noticed all day I getting the cold sweats. I was clammy most of the day, but didn?t feel tired.  Took temperature after someone noticed I looked pale at work. My temp was 99.7.  At around 4:30 I noticed my left armpit was hurting. Went home at 5:30 and relaxed. I told my husband my armpit was hurting around 10:30pm, I decided to Take my temp at 11:15pm and it was 97.6.  I will see if the adverse side affects go away after today.

She answered:  &#34;They got worse this am from 5 to 10 and feeling better now.  As far as swelling and breathing feels better.  3/1 10:21 AM  Dr. Spoke with patient 10:21 am.

She felt well enough to return to work today.    3/3 11:09 AM  Dr. spoke with patient.  She stated that she is finally feeling &#34;back to normal&#34;.  We discussed severity of side effects and recommendation to defer 2nd Pfizer vaccination.  She stated that at one point she was &#34;close to going to the ER&#34;.

A 44-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm, on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from 2017 and ongoing, cosmetic filler injections got in her face within the last year and half or 2 years. Patient said that she knew that Allergan asked her doctor about her ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s as well. She takes medication for that. Patient also said that her white blood cell count runs low, like around 2 if they want to note that as an immune system thing and she confirmed that was an issue for her prior to receiving the COVID 19 vaccine. Family medical history included that her daughter has Hasimotos as well. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications for Hashimoto&#39;s disease. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EI1685) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 18Dec2020 at the year of 44 years at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. She said her doctor believes she is having a reaction with her fillers. She clarified fillers were like cosmetic injections got in her face. She thought the filler was called Allergan but she didn&#39;t have any other information about it. She did know her doctor did call Allergan and did a report with them. She thought it was like a big deal because it was not documented with Pfizer just with Moderna. She said the doctor was also going to call and report this as well. The doctor has not called yet but he said he was going to, she just left their office. Basically the places she had had filler injections within the last year and half or 2 years not have, under her right eye there was a large bump that was swollen and then the places that were called labial folds, the marionette lines where she had had filler there were all swollen and that was on the right side of her face and then on the left side the marionette lines were swollen as well so basically everywhere she had had filler injections were swollen except the left eye, the left eye is not swollen. And the places were swollen and hard. She first noticed the swelling yesterday 25Jan2021. The bump on her right eye was yesterday around 15:00 and then this morning (26Jan2021) it was much worse under her eye and she noticed the bumps on the right side at about 6 am this morning and around 9 am she began feeling it on the left side and it progressively has gotten worse since it started in all of those areas (26Jan2021). This case reported as serious. Patient did not visit Emergency Room, but she has been to 2 different physicians in physician office. No other vaccines administered on the same day as either dose of the suspect product. Patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was not recovered.    Reporter assessed event everywhere she had had filler injections are swollen except the left eye, her left eye is not swollen as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information a contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be fully excluded. Consideration should also be given to the contribution from the cosmetic filler injections. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Poc  marks developed as well where swelling was, armpits, shoulder blade and legs all right side. Swelling increased became very red and hot to touch, itching all where marks were.  I was taking Benadryl and applying cortisone cream.  On Friday went to walk in, advised not much they can do stop taking Benadryl.  On 0321.2021 hives broke out all on right arm started Benadryl again. Still have them now over a week later.

Developed all over body aches, chills subsided by noon on same day they began. Injection site swelled, and was very red. Swelling spread to underarm/lymph node area. Headache began in early morning on day after shot as well, and nausea set in as well. Slept most of day, ran fever, was nauseous, and achy. The second day after the vaccine was improved - no headache, appetite returned, fever was better. Arm and underarm was still red, swollen and sore, and had overall tiredness and still achy. The only lasting side effect was the red, swollen,  and sore arm, which is now almost back to normal. There is still some soreness in the arm and underarm, but the redness and swelling is gone as of 3/22.

                                                Around 6pm I started with a slight headache and by 8pm i had trouble keeping my eyes open.  (headache is not uncommon for me but the extreme drowsiness is).   I slept solid through the night (unusual) and the puppy woke me around 5am. (ususal)  I felt that i had a heavy? head.  My thoughts seemed clear but my head had a fullness to it.  Its difficult to describe.  I was not stuffy.  I had trouble staying awake, to the point I was nodding off at times I should have been able to stay awake.  I did not feel safe to work and felt obligated to call in.  I slept solidly for the next 5 hours.  Later in the day, my affected arm began to have pain radiate from the injection site to my wrist.  (probably not unusual).  600mg of Ibuprofen did not seem to help much.  By the time I went to bed last night (24&#43; hrs after receiving the vaccine) I noticed my axillary nymph nodes were extremely tender to the touch and remain so this morning.  The pain in my arm still continues to radiate to my wrist but not as intense.

                                                On 12-16-2020 I received my first Pfizer injection and 5 days after I experienced lymphadenopathy to my neck, left arm and under the arm and clavicle. My lymph nodes are swelling and I am concerned since I never had my lymph nodes swell up. On my second injection 01-06-2021, I continue with lymph node swelling and my symptoms do not seem to go away. I went to see my doctor, that said  it was probably a reaction to the Pfizer injection and he is recommending that in February 2021,  if I still have swelling to my lymph nodes then lab work will be performed.

Woke up around 1:30am on 1/19/21 and could not go back to sleep with overall malaise and pain in my right axilla (ipsilateral to vaccine); upon palpation of this area, I could feel enlarged lymph nodes, very sensitive to the touch (never had this from a vaccine, and I take usual flu shots and others occasionally recommended). Malaise slowly went away during the day, pain in right axilla persisted, although not as bothersome for about 2 days. On 1/19/21, I also had myalgia, which were still present on 1/20/19, but slowly subsided. Today 1/22 the enlarged right axillary adenopathy is still palpable, mild to no pain.. No additional symptoms.

The next morning my right ear swelled , was red and covered in hives and very painful.  It continued to swell over next few days, very painful. I was feeling drained and had gastrointestinal symptoms for days and this morning woke up with my face swollen and another rash and hives on my face. I had a little trouble breathing as well and went to an Urgent Care. The doctor believes I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and administered a steroid injection and prescribed steroids and antihistamines.

The lymphadenopathy was diagnosed in a routine mammogram/ultrasound screening 9 days after the vaccine.  I finally started feeling better the week I was scheduled to receive my second shot.  I got my second shot on 1/14/2021.  Within 12 hours, I had a 101 fever and muscle aches.  I also had axilla lymphadenopathy.  Within 3 days, I was feeling better, however about 8 days post vaccine, I started to experience bouts of tachycardia and dizziness again.  As time progresses, these symptoms are slowly improving.

Though it was 98.5, that is higher than my personal &#39;normal&#39; temp. I am typically 97.3-7.  Checked again on my flushed cheeks to see that my face was swollen. I ran into a neighbor, though wearing a mask, she didn&#39;t see/say anything, and I felt okay enough not to bring it up. By the end of the day, swelling in my cheeks was less noticeable so I went to bed thinking I wasn&#39;t having more than a typical vaccine reaction. I woke up the next day with swollen eyelids.  I&#39;ve only become concerned after googling the general side effects and saw &#39;swelling of the face&#39; and/or &#39;swollen eyelids&#39; listed as both &#34;common&#34; and &#34;when to call a doctor&#34;. My (non)fever is up and down over the past few days though I still feel flushed with more pink in my cheeks.

After my second dose vaccine, my lymph nodes were visibly enlarged. I experienced muscle soreness, lymph nodes were enlarged, left side, had chills, sore throat, ear ache radiated towards my neck and had a viral pink eye. I felt very tired and had muscle aches. I had a fever of 99.4F, mostly chills and joint pain to my left shoulder, left hip and left knee. I also had 3 Covid swab testes which were all negative.  I saw my doctor who performed a x-ray of the chest and has put off a mammogram test till April 2021. At this time I have not recovered there is something going on with my pelvis, form my iliac crest when bending down I feel a pinched lymph node on that area of iliac crest. I get a pinch on my pelvis that is painful.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the injection, as I was scheduling my second dose and then while I was waiting, my left should (upper left side of my back) started aching. I do not normally have any kind of a response to any vaccine, so I didn&#39;t immediately connect this pain with my COVID-19 vaccine, however, it continued to get progressively worse and ultimately became my entire arm, shoulder, neck and head.  I had a lot of difficulty sleeping for the next two nights and I noticed yesterday morning (Sunday, 3/21/21) that my left clavicle was completely obscured by significant swelling (I assume lymphnodes). Golf ball-sized swelling.  Today (Monday, 3/22/21) the swelling continues to be significant and I think maybe covering more area.  Not as pronounced of a lump, but more of a squashed, larger lump, if that makes sense?

My cheeks started to get red and a bit swollen, then my breathing was getting weird, my blood pressure rise. At that moment I agreed to go in the rescue.

On 2/4/21 I had body aches, headache, low grade fever, joint pain. On 2/5/21 Fever up to 102, severe body aches and headache and joint pain. By 2/6/21, most S/S had gone no more fever or body aches. However, I noticed significant swelling Left shoulder blade and arm pit. Left shoulder was painful to touch and arm pit was sore. The headache continued but milder now located almost completely at base of skull. By 2/17/21 I noticed the swelling in Left shoulder blade had gone down, however the armpit remained very swollen. Also, in addition I have a lot of bilateral swelling in my neck most noticeable right above my clavicle on both sides. This swelling is also painful and my neck is very stiff and painful to turn to the sides. I saw my PCP on 3/19/21 regarding as I am now over 6 weeks post vaccination.

                                                Really sore arm the day after. Developed a full body rash anout 36 hours after the shot. 48 hours later developed a bright red. burning and painful rash on my face. On day 3 I went to work and underneath my right eye started to swell up and a red streak from the inner corner of my eyelid went down my face. On day 4 I woke up with both eyes swollen.  I started on benedryl. 2x a day. The redness,  welts and hives traveled down my face, onto my neck,  then up my forehead and onto my earlobes. On March 22, day 5, I woke with even more swelling on my face and both eyes. The rash was very bad. I called my primary care physician and made an appointment to see him on Tuesday. I went for that appointment and dr. gave me antihistamines, took pictures and reported it to CDC.  I started the antihistamines, but on Day 7, I woke up with the worst of it. Hives all down my neck, lips swollen,  bruising and swollen eyes and itchy red rash everywhere. I called the dr back and started prednizone steriods. Today,  March 26, it is starting to calm down.

By 9 pm, I felt like my lymph nodes in my neck were swollen, my throat was getting sore, and my head was starting to throb.  I took 2 tylenol and went to bed.  I woke up at 3 am with a 101.6 temp and body aches.  By 8 am on 1/13/2021, I could not lift my own body out of bed or roll over.  The fever and body aches continued around the clock for 55 hrs.  The headaches are debilitating and continue. I have tried Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Excedrin, and Imitrex and none of these have helped.  I missed 3 days of work and 2 weekend days trying to recover and i am still not back to normal.  Headaches are still happening everyday.  At one point in the middle of this, i felt like I should go to the hospital, but I was too sick to get out of bed and shower and make myself go.

I did a Saliva test (covid test), while waiting for my test above my collar bone was swollen.  I was generally not feeling well. I got my results on the 25th and it was negative. On the 30th I got heart fluttering, feelin racy. It went away. On the 1st, I felt so wiped out and heart was going nuts, and I went to get a EKG that was normal but my BP was  high140/high 80. On the 4th I went back to work again and still felt horrible, dizzy and they sent me to the ER and had High BP and two normal EKG&#39;, and the hooked me up to a heart monitor for a week.  With both shots I had insomnia of the walls.   Second Dose: it was much better than 1st dose.  The Monday after the 2nd dose I got a really bad headache. I drank some Pedialyte and took a 12 hour nap and felt great after.

                                                March 10, 9am, received injection in left arm.  Minor headache throughout the day.  That afternoon (~3:00pm) noticed itchy neck and face.  (Since I had a rash last year from skincare products I just thought it was same thing).  March 11, rash worse.  Treated with topical 2.5% hydrocortisone ointment.  Back of head started feeling tender.  March 12, evening, back of head feeling worse, took Ibuprofen.  Rash much better on face/neck.  Middle of night (March 12), head extremely painful and noticed swollen lymph nodes on back/right side of head.  March 13, 8:00am, went to urgent care clinic.  Received Cefdinir 300mg antibiotic for unknown infection causing swollen lymph nodes.  Rash almost gone.  Back of head extremely tender/painful.  March 14, swollen lymph nodes multiplied on back of head and also on right side of neck.  Saw neighbor anesthesiologist who thought my rash and swollen lymph nodes were caused by the vaccine.  March 15, lymph nodes still swollen, but feels more burning/itching like a rash now with occasional throbbing pain.  Spreading more in right side of neck, which is sore/tender.  Slight rash on neck.

In the morning I had above symptoms, painful lymph nodes in neck and groin, and elevated body temp of 100. But the most significant reaction was swelling and BRUISING around the eyes. Left side definitely worse than the right. I haven&#39;t heard of this, so I thought I&#39;d reach out to you.

                                                On March 5, I received my first dose of the Covid shot. Later that day, I was fatigued.  Six days later, however, sometime early morning on March 12, (I was in and out of sleep because of it), I had pain swallowing my saliva on my left side (also the side of my vaccine in my arm). It was hard to pinpoint but the pain came from somewhere at the back of my throat and my ear. If I had to guess what time it was, it probably was around 1-2am that the pain began. March 12, I went to see my primary care doctor. He checked my ears &amp; didn&#39;t see any concern. He saw a little redness at the back of my throat but couldn&#39;t definitively say what I had. He thought it was a virus but didn?t discount a reaction to the vaccine (although he said it was unlikely since reactions usually happen within 3 days). He ran no tests and didn&#39;t prescribe anything.  March 13, I was feeling worse. I suddenly had a fever (101 was the highest it ever got), swollen lymph nodes, a white tongue. I went to the local ER at 9am who said I might have oral thrush but he didn?t sound convinced because my tongue wasn&#39;t as white o thick as thrush would present (he said for example that typically when you have thrush, you could scrap it off and it would bleed). He diagnosed me with Thrush and Lymphadenopathy. He prescribed anti-fungus medication Clotrimazole 10 mg Troche, five times a day. On Sunday, March 14, my throat pain got worse (it was constant pain v.s. pain only swallowing) so I called the on-call doc who told me to get tested for Strep.  The next day, on March 15, I could swallow easier so my doctor didn&#39;t think it was necessary. My lymph nodes were still swollen, I had a bit of a fever, and it was still a bit hard to swallow but I was recovering. I had some lingering ear pain.  By March 15 I was much better.  Today, March 19, I still have a sensation on my left ear/throat area after swallowing but I am much better. Please note that while the ER doctor thought it was fungal and my primary care doctor thought it was viral, neither were sure/thought it was the vaccine.   ** Also please note, this is the second time I am completing this because the system booted me off after 20 min the first time and it was erased. It takes times to complete. Just a thought for future reference, it might be helpful to allow for more time.**

The patient developed fever, cough, myalgias on 19Feb2021 at 12:00 AM. She developed peripheral swelling in hands/feet on 24Feb2021, she was evaluated in the ER; admitted to (hospital name withheld) on 24Feb2021 with cardiogenic shock, myocarditis, hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was started on IV vancomycin and Unasyn. TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) demonstrated LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) 35%; reduced biventricular function; mural thrombus on 24Feb2021. Remained hypotensive despite pressors on 24Feb2021. Patient had elevated PCW with preserved cardiac index. Patient underwent VA ECMO (veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and Impella placement on 25Feb2021. COVID-19 PCR was negative. Blood cultures were no growth. She developed severe thrombocytopenia and developed bleeding at Impella insertion site on 25Feb2021; required multiple, PRBC transfusions. Evaluated for HLH; Soluble IL2 receptor on 26Feb2021 elevated at 7232 pg/mL; ferritin 3054; CRP &gt; 300. ECMO stopped 03Mar2021. The patient was treated with IV antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, pressor support, underwent VA ECMO and Impella placement. The patient was hospitalized from 24Feb2021 to 16Mar2021. Number of days of hospitalization was 20 days. The patient tested COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: hypotensive despite pressors, LVEF: 35 %, nasal swab: Negative on 24Feb2021, blood cultures: No growth, nasal swab: Negative on 25Feb2021, ferritin: 3054, HLH: Evaluated, Soluble IL2 receptor: 7232 pg/mL (elevated at 7232 pg/mL), CRP: &gt; 300 on 26Feb2021, nasal swab: Negative on 11Mar2021, nasal swab: Negative on 14Mar2021. The events were considered as serious (hospitalization and life threatening) by the physician. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: the events being serious, life threatening and hospitalisation ,medical intervention required are  assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug __BNT162B2____ based on strong temporal association, but consider also possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and/or concomitant medications.

This occurred again one week following my second vaccine (2nd shot 1/29), for approximately 5 days.  It has occurred three times since then, all on the Friday anniversary of my getting the shot. The symptoms for the last 3 times lasted only 2 days, and the redness has decreased, but they are still extremely itchy and have now become scaly at the site of where the most severe itching took place. They do burn occasionally at the site of the scales.

She ended up getting a cardiac catheterization while she was there which was normal.   The day prior to this she had actually received her second Covid vaccination in her left arm.  She noticed achiness and soreness across her shoulders bilaterally into her chest and into her neck.  She had some subjective fevers and chills and felt generally fatigued.  She also had a lot of swelling in her left axilla and she ended up getting a CT scan during her workup which revealed some left axillary adenopathy.  She returned to the ER on 3/16: while brushing her teeth, she developed right facial paresthesias that marched over approximately 20 minutes to involve the right arm and the right leg.  She went to the hospital.  She was seen in the ER.  They felt this represented possible ischemia.  They gave her tPA.  She had a hemorrhagic nosebleed.  Did not develop any other signs of bleeding. Her symptoms had not resolved.  She was discharged from home.  She had a headache at the time of her visit to the ER.  Her headache had resolved by the time she was discharged home, but she continues to note paresthesias in the right side of her body, right face, and notes over the last day or 2, she has had increased dysarthria, dizziness and slurred speech, brain fog, a sensation of heaviness and inability to think.  She states she currently does not have head pain per se, but she does note that she just feels generally poorly.  She feels like her brain is working faster than her mouth muscles are.  She is in today for neurologic followup, concerned about these ongoing issues.  she continues to struggle with her speech feeling quite slow and deliberate, she feels like it is difficult for her to concentrate, she is forgetful, she still has intermittent episodes of paresthesias in her face, arm, and hand, she feels like she becomes heart and flushed and she has some heart rate variability with her heart going slow and fast, and she has significant disequilibrium.  She is extremely fatigued where she is only able to get up for 1-2 hours before she is extremely fatigued and has to go back to bed.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK5730, expiry date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 17Dec2020 at 07:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing neuralgia since 2003 (has nerve pain in her face and neck. It has never caused swelling and that she has had it for a long time. Symptoms started 17 years ago, became apparent in 2009), ongoing hypothyroidism since 2003 (Diagnosed about 17 years ago. Nothing has changed medication wise). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that she got the vaccine on 17Dec2020. On 25Dec2020, her shoes felt snug and by the next day she had 4 plus pitting edema. She could not fit in the shoes. She had the pitting edema for several days. She said that she went and bought compression stockings to help with the edema. It was her feet, ankles, and 3/4 way up her shins. It was more of the pedal area that was pitting. The patient further reported that she never had pitting edema before and the only thing new she had was the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event which included compression stockings. The patient was recovering from the event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported event pitting edema.

She was the patient who received her first dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine on 24Dec2020. She reported onset of what the Urgent Care Physician believed was Shingles on 27Dec2020. She called to ask if she should or should not receive the second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine on 14Jan2021 as scheduled due to the Shingles. The Urgent Care Physician advised her to still get the second dose, as there was about a 1:10,000 chance of developing shingles with the vaccine. She reported shingles as a reaction subsequent to the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. Initially on 27Dec2020 she developed sites of what she thought were canker sores or fever blisters in her mouth which had gotten pretty large and stopped her from being able to eat on 29Dec2020. Then on 30Dec2020 she developed sites on her face which have gotten scarily large; and was causing some deep nerve pain going to her eye and down her chin; the sites felt like lesions on her face with roots. The sites in her mouth were now completely gone; but the sites on her face are ongoing. Now it has kind of taken over her face. She saw the Urgent Care Physician regarding this who believed the sites to be shingles. She had never had fever blisters or shingles before this event. She was still kind of reeling. The report was reported as non-serious. The outcome of event ball palsy/facial dropping was resolved and of shingles was unknown.

A 47-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:49 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   There were no known medical history or concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced nausea, headache, and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

By midafternoon, the nausea and stomach pains subsided, all other symptoms remained along with then getting a 100.5 fever. I was taking Tylenol every 4 hours since 1am and keeping hydrated. By midnight I was exhausted and was finally able to sleep. I woke the following morning with a dull headache and just felt achy. I felt much better by that evening (now Monday). Tuesday morning I woke with discomfort to my left armpit and clavicle area. I then noticed swelling, the areas felt ?lumpy? and were very tender to touch. That lasted about 2 days.

                                                The first night of the shot I had severe pain in both arms and could not sleep. The first 3 days I felt tired and chilled, without fever. After the third day, symptoms subsided and I was back to normal activity. On the 7th day following the vaccine, I began having pain in the armpit of the left side. It was painful to have pressure on the area and to raise the arm overhead. It progressed on the the 8th day with increased pain and tenderness to touch. On the 9th day, I had severe pain with palpation and could feel a lump in the armpit. I have no redness, heat, or rash in the area. I went to my physician with concern because I have had a double mastectomy two years ago.

                                                I was vaccinated at 3:30pm .  At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

                                                When I got my first half of vaccine I did have a swollen lymph node along my collar bone on the left side; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This 47-year-old female nurse reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: EK5730) at single dose in the left upper arm for vaccination on 21Dec2020. Relevant history included Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drug included Lisinopril 10 mg daily for blood pressure, Omeprazole 20 mg daily,  Vitamin Supplements. The nurse stated, &#34; When I got my first dose of vaccine I did have a swollen lymph node along my collar bone on the left side which is on the side where I got the shot and it didn&#39;t really change much. It just kind of stayed the same size and it remained there for whole three weeks.  This small one along my collar bone that started right after the first vaccine and that has stayed the whole time. But got bigger after my second.&#34;  No treatment was received. The outcome of event was not resolved. The patient believed the swollen lymph nodes were due to the Covid 19 Vaccine.

                                                2 hours after vaccine, I had an anaphylactic reaction. I had an extremely difficult time breathing with chest tightening, heart racing, numbness and tingling on my mouth and chin, tongue swollen and turned grey in a matter of a few minutes. I took Benadryl, an epinephrine pen, and a nebulizer and began to start feeling better in 15 minutes. Following the 2 weeks I felt nauseous, chills, cold sweat, lightheaded, weak, tired, headache and pain in arm/shoulder.

                                                Initial symptoms were sore throat and nausea the evening of the vaccination (Wednesday, 2/3/21).  Those continued the following day and as the day progressed I also was experiencing a headache, mild achiness, left side of my neck was sore/tender, and then that evening chills and a fever of 101.3.  On Friday, 2/5/21 I woke up with a very sore and swollen right axilla and still had a headache, but the fever resolved over night.  All symptoms, except right axillary swelling/soreness was resolved by the afternoon on 2/6/21.  Currently, on 2/8/21, I still have mild tenderness/soreness in right axilla.

At 2 PM she still had a headache and she lost most of the taste and smell; at 4 pm she was sick to her stomach; by 5:15, her arm and head hurt badly, the taste in her mouth was like super weird but it was not exactly metallic taste it was weird bizarre taste she never had before. Her smell came back. She was extremely nauseated and had a bad headache. She stated that all of her symptoms were gone away except the swelling in her throat. She further stated she called the hospital and stated she got injection site pain, headache, and muscle pain. She also got injection site swelling and redness, nausea, swollen lymph node and a headache and the weirdest part that really bothered her was the strange taste in her mouth. She got some of the smell and taste back and now it&#39;s gone; it&#39;s really bizarre like the injection site pain, the headache everything was gone literally gone. The only things that was still hanging on was her lymph nodes and throat. The second due dose of vaccine was on 14Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from swelling in her throat and swollen lymph node, and has recovered from other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot Number EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration from 25Jan2021 14:00 (at the age of 47 years old), Dose 2, as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included she had her tonsils out on an unknown date. She was a nurse that works with COVID patients; she got tested twice last week (Jan2021), both were negative. She had no pre-existing medical conditions. She has never had a problem with vaccines. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 04Jan2021 (Lot # EX9231) and experienced no reaction then. The patient had the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 2 PM yesterday (25Jan2021) and she kept moving around in bed and feeling sick last night. That night she was just tired and achy but she thought that could just be from working. She went to bed early and she woke up around 1:50 or 2 AM with chills so she went and got a thermometer. She woke up at about 2 AM (26Jan2021) with a 103 fever and chills and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and her face felt swollen, but her right carotid hurt. Her skin just burns; she went to take a shower. With the skin burning she knew it was sore to touch but when she got in the shower, that was when she noticed it hurt. She was really achy; her legs were aching and she was having shooting pains in different spots. She commented that she called out today (26Jan2021), she never calls out; all she wanted to do was take a shower and she wondered if she needed to go to the doctor. Her skin burns even when she was showering; every part her skin burns. She was also having muscle and joint pain and cough and the back of her ribs hurt (Jan2021). The other thing was nausea (Jan2021).  The fever and chills were persisting and were about the same. She was hoping for it to go down so she could go to work to tomorrow (27Jan2021). The clinical outcome of the fever, chills, and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and hurt was not recovered.   The clinical outcome of feeling sick, tired and achy, face feels swollen, skin burning, muscle and joint pain, cough, back of her ribs hurt, nausea, and shooting pains in different spots was unknown. The reporter states she thinks what she is reporting was directly related to the product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The morning after receiving the 2nd dose I had severe fatigue, joint pain, my wrist and my armpit was budging, I noticed swelling my clavicle on my left side, chills, and dizzy. I had to miss work for 2 days. I had to lay bed in for 2 days. By 3rd it was much improved but I still feel weak. About 4 days after receiving the vaccine I was back to feeling my self.  On 2/14-15/2021, my face was itching, I scratched it, and there is a small abrasion. My face started to swell, around 2AM this morning I had to go to the ER because my eyes were getting small, the swelling was getting worse. I also had bumps that looked like hives on my face,  there was some fluid coming out of my face. I went to  early this morning,     The ER doctor said she thinks it is not infected she thinks it is inflamed. I did not mention that I had recently received the COVID  vaccine and did not realize that it may be linked to the vaccine until later in the day. She prescribed Hydrocortisone 0.5 % cream  and Mupirocin 2% cream.   Since I have been home the ER the swelling has worsened. My face is painful, it feels like an orange peel when you touch.

                                                After my first vaccine, I developed an axillary lymph node to my left arm which was painful; it felt like it was ripping out of my left arm and it was tender. The lymph node subsided after two days of the vaccination. I also had two menstrual cycles back to back which was out of the ordinary for me since I am regular on my periods.  I saw my gynecologist due to my menstrual symptoms. I was regular up to that point of my vaccination. One week ago I had better range of motion to my left arm.

                                                I had my 2nd dose of Phizer Covid Vaccine on February 19, 2021 and had it in my left arm.  My first dose 3 weeks prior was in my right arm.  I did not experience any side effects from the shot for 4 days.  I woke up on Tuesday, February 23rd and had pain in my right arm - the arm I had the 1st shot in, not the 2nd!  I continued to have pain in my right arm for several days and then 6 days after my 2nd dose I started having extreme pain in my legs - from my knees up the back of my thighs for two days.  Then 8 days after my 2nd dose my other arm became very sore, the arm I had the 2nd dose in.  So both arms are sore and the lymph nodes under the arms are tender.  Today I am 11 days out since my 2nd dose and I woke up and could barely lift my left arm. I have pain in both arms and lymph nodes.  I went to my family doctor and he does not have any answers for me.  I need to know if this is something I should be concerned about and if there is anything I can do to help these side effects go away.  How long can this last???

                                                The entire left side of my body immediately felt mildly heavy and affected, but it was so minimal I thought it could be in my head. Throughout the evening after my shot I felt a bit of contracting of leg muscles and neck/shoulder muscles on the left side of my body. The left side of my face felt noticeably warmer than the right. This was all very mild, but just noticeable. In the middle of the night, I woke up with extreme night sweats but only on the left side of my body. The next morning (today) the left side of my face is still warmer but it feels droopy and bloated and slightly &#34;Numbish&#34;. My left eyelid feels heavy. My left cheeks feel swollen and puffy and my left gums and lips feel slightly numb. I also have a very mild headache only on the left side. This is disturbing, while it is not debilitating or painful, it is strange and makes me think I should not get the next shot. Even as I type this, my left hand feels very fatigued. I don&#39;t know who to call or talk to about this. I do not have a health care provider.

The nerve has never caused numbness beyond my left arm before, however, Last round of trembling about 48 hours after injection  72 hours later: Left tonsil and throat and armpit lymph nodes still swollen, but markedly less. Moderate numbness in left cheek and left side of throat, but less.

                                                47-year-old female presented for anaphylactic allergic reaction after getting her first dose of Covid19 vaccine.  Patient was initially seen by Dr., who then signed out to me pending observation and reevaluation.  In summary, patient had received total of 2 EpiPen 1 at home and 1 in the ED in conjunction with soluMedrol, Benadryl, and Pepcid.  Patient has history of anxiety and jittery as well as nervousness after epinephrine.  Patient was then given 1 mg p.o. Ativan for her symptom.     On my evaluation, patient is not in respiratory distress, She is still  Tachycardic in the 110s-120s  Which is likely from the EpiPen.  Patient stated that she normally stays tachycardic for a while after the epipen.  Patient otherwise not in respiratory distress, her posterior pharynx and her uvula is not swelling.  Patient also has no wheezing on auscultation exam.  We discussed the possibility of staying in the hospital under observation versus going home.  Patient reported she is back at baseline and would like to be discharged and I was in agreement with this plan. Patient does has 3 more epipen at home to use for worsening symptoms. She will be prescribed medrol dose pack. Red flags signs and symptoms were discussed with strict return instruction were given. Patient verbalized understanding and was in agreement with the plan. She was then discharged in stable condition.

                                                I got shot in left arm and entire left side of my body reacted. One the day of the shot, I got muscle aches in my left leg and my left arm and leg felt heavy. During the night, I got extreme night sweats but ONLY on the left side of my body. Right side was dry. The next day I got a headache on the left side of my head only, the left side of my face was hot and right side was cool, aches in my left leg arm, neck, and shoulder. Then my left side of my face became numb and swollen. The numbness on the left side of my face got a little better every day but lasted for a week and even 2 weeks later it feels a bit tighter than the right side. I am supposed to get the 2nd shot in a week, and I do not believe I should but really need to talk to someone about this. No one is returning my messages and I have emailed VAERS.. please help.

My arm got very sore at the site of injection the next day for about 24 hr.  I started to notice pulsation on my ears. Then as the days went by, this turned into hyperacusis and I consulted about it on Feb 26th. the day of the second shot.. My physician referred me to an ENT. I saw the ENT on Feb 29 and had a hearing test the same day, they found no signs of hearing loss or abnormal conditions. I was diagnosed with pulsation tinnitus and hyperacusis.  After the second dose, I had a skin reaction. I had redness at the site of the injection and developed a blister the same day. Then, two days later I noticed a swollen lymph node on the left side of the neck. My arm was very sore from the injection again. I noticed that the joints on my right arm are in  acute pain.

Took Vicks 44 tried to sleep completely miserable. Took Tylenol to try to get fever down. Still so miserable I couldn&#39;t swollen because my ear pain was bad. My friend drove me to the nearest minor med. I couldnt tolerate any light, barely walk, dizzy and hurting all over.  My lymph nodes started swelling up all over my body. I am still in pain and hurting , exhausted 5 days later. I have kept a constant headache, still exhausted, and can rest with pain meds.

My vagina felt itchy and then immediately afterward a very painful and swollen further inside. That was Friday night. for the remainder of the weekend I had terribly painful urination. I called my OB/GYN and scheduled an appointment for January 19. I prescribed Valtrex for possible herpes and Ciprofloxacin for possible bladder infection. The results came back as Oral herpes that were in my vagina.  I would like to add that I did have a strong immune response to the second covid vaccine and had muscle aches, chills and malaise.

The vaccine center said because I was able to breathe they could not transport me to the emergency room or urgent care center.

Redness was in an area over right deltoid approximately 4in vertically X 3 in horizontally. Redness did not go into shoulder, but started approximately 2 finger breaths below shoulder. Appeared vaccination was given in proper location. Client stated she was taking .Motrin and using the arm very frequently. She was tearful when moving arm.  Client feels her pain threshold is high due to hx of broken hip in past and this pain seems worse. Client was very concerned about a worse reaction with a second vaccine. Client did state, &#34; the nurse said I was a really small person so she was going to use a smaller needle.&#34;  This nurse believes that means nurse at mass vaccination clinic used a 5/8 in needle. Client probably weighs 120-130lbs. Client did not and did not want to sign up for Vsafe. After discussion client decided to go to Urgent Care. Follow-up phone call to client  at 12:30pm on 3/26. Client states Urgent Care Dr did not think it was cellulitis. Client was very fatigued and stated she then went to daughters and took 2 hour nap. She felt she did not want to go home by self as she was still very concerned. Client states, &#39;has hx of developing significant tongue swelling throat closing reaction to Bactrim  about 4 days after starting and physician telling her in the ER she could have died if she did not come in&#39;.  Advised her to get 2nd vaccine. Client is still undecided about getting 2nd vaccine. Pain has decreased, but arm remains swollen and is now itchy.  Client will continue to monitor and return to urgent care if symptoms get worse.

Later I started wheezing and my right ankle and leg were swollen  so, I went to the urgacare.  They saw me but told me that I should&#39;ve gone to the ER. I have a history of anaphylaxis. They gave me steriods and Benadryl via shots and sent me home with the same.  I woke the next morning with a sore arm, a horrible headache and my face broke out into hives and was swollen again. Today is the 4th day after and my face still feels a little swollen, I have a headache and now an earache in my left ear.  Today I also felt nauseous and couldn&#39;t eat.

I did not get better. I felt even more on fire and my skin was hot to the touch. My tongue was really swollen and things get super fuzzy after the I might die feeling. Epi#2 Given around 5 minutes after Epipen 1. Medics took me to the ER and  more rescue meds were given. I was admitted to the nuero trauma floor for 24 hrs and given meds and iv fluids. I got out the next afternoon. By the next day I was back in urgent care. They gave me meds and sent me home. By 9pm that night I was using epi#3 and going back to the ambulance. I have been to urgent care 2 times since for continued issues. I have zero appetite and my whole GI system hates me. I am alive and breathing but still feeling the impact of all of this.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; neuropathy in fingers, toes, roof of mouth/lips; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 48-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EL0140) at single dose on left arm on 30Dec2020 at 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma (controlled); hypertension diagnosis 1 year ago; allergies to medications, food and environmental. Concomitant medications in two weeks included antihypertensives - amlodipine and losartan. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 30Dec2020 at 9:15 AM, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction within 10 minutes of administration, neuropathy in fingers, toes, roof of mouth/lips. Neuropathy continued to date. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment Epinephrine IM (intramuscular) and IV (intravenous) steroids. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of anaphylactic reaction and neuropathy peripheral due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.

                                                Initial event was soreness at site which resolved on its own within a few days.  2 days after receiving vaccine, I began having an allergy reaction  to the same brand N95 that I had been utilizing since the beginning of the pandemic. Symptoms are swollen cheeks and welts , sudden itchiness at the site of my mask placement. The reason for this report is a sudden onset of excruciating and debilitating pain throughout my body specifically pain of my right shoulder radiating down my sprightly arm. I have been receiving testing and treatment for ongoing neuropathy due to Longhauler syndrome, however This recent pain is so debilitating, I spend most of my time in bed.  I have been experiencing chills then profuse sweating.  I also so fatigued, I sleep much of the day.  I have been having episodes of tachycardia with chest tightness which has increased since after having the vaccine. I also become short winded on exertion. I?ve been waking up in a panic and sweating.

The patient was prescribed a 4 day prednisone 50mg daily course along with Benadryl as needed and Pepcid 40mg daily which she states have helped alleviate the itchiness but has not completely resolved yet as of today 1/15/2020.   Per ED note, patient presented with mild erythema around the injection site and non-specific rash to the neck. Patient has clear speech and no oral swelling and no signs of anaphylaxis. Patient discharged home in stable condition and advised to follow up with primary care doctor in 2-3 days.

On the 13th of Jan, I was at work from 7am-7pm and my arm was even more swollen, sore, itchy and reddish, no fever, I was still able to work, but my L axillary area was sore the whole day. I went home and took a shower and noticed that my L armpit was swollen, like the size of a tennis ball! No redness, no fevers but sore and discomforting due to the swelling.

                                                At approximately hour 40 post vaccine my Axillary lymph node became very enlarged, painful and hard.  It was causing a tingling in my arm, like a pinched nerve and was painful to keep my arm in a relaxed position.  The node was visible if I lifted my arm above my head.  With a dose of ibuprofen, the swelling reduced but it was still palpable and painful for the next 18 hours.  By the 72 hour vaccine mark, all symptoms were gone.

I walked to my car, my fingers were a little tingly, then when I took my mask off the left side of my face was swelling, tingly, red (I have rosacea- but this was different) I did not panic, but I knew something was wrong. I decided to drive to the hospital instead of driving home, the valet said my face was swelling. I went to the ER - was given Pepic and Benadryl via an IV - I was there for observation - as I was waiting for my medication, I began to feel itchy at the base of my neck and on my chest

Nurse accompanied her back in side, and went over other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Client stated she was not experiencing any of those symptoms and that she felt better. When her wait was complete, she walked to the coat room with other employees, and her throat and ears  began to itch, and she was coughing to  help itch her throat. At this time the vaccine director was alerted and anaphylactic protocol was initiated.

Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant drugs included lisinopril for blood pressure/hypertension, omeprazole and vitamin supplements. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot# EK5730) on 21Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and having a swollen lymph node along her collar bone on the left side which was on the side where she got the shot and it didn&#39;t really change much, it just kind of stayed the same size and it remained there for whole three weeks.

Nurse further stated she also had some intermittent fatigue that she expected and also off and on feelings of like disconnection or feelings of like of being drunk. But that&#39;s not very bothersome, that&#39;s just once in a while since 11Jan2021. But she was concerned about the swelling of lymph nodes. No treatment was received for events. Outcome of events was not recovered. Nurse believed that swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and feeling drunk were due to the Covid 19 Vaccine.

On Sunday arm started turning red a size of a softball was extremely red swollen and hot to the touch, shoulder area and under arm pit was swollen and hurt to touch are move. Was informed by employee health to start taking antihistamines (which I already take) so she told me to increase the amount by taking Benadryl as well and icing it on and off for 30 minutes at a time,  The people here at my work checked it regularly and slowly it is improving each day as long as I ice and take extra antihistamines.

Headache, fatigue (exhausted), brain fog, muscle tightness (unable to take a deep breath due to tightness...not short of breath). Swollen lymph nodes in right armpit, overall feeling exhausted.   Treatment: I just slept a lot, took Tylenol.  I have a doctors appointment today.  Outcome: Slowly getting better. Still have brain fog , fatigue (not exhausted anymore), muscle weakness (not the severe pain anymore).

The reaction occurred 7days after the first dose and the next day after the 2nd dose.

I also have internal cold sores - one almost right on the other side of the lesion,  one on the other side of my lip. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS A SIDE EFFECT or just a coincidence. I don&#39;t have herpes or any history of lip lesions. I don&#39;t remember biting my inside lip and they are too high for that type of injury anyway.

                                                After ten minutes my throat began to feel swollen, a feeling of a lump in my throat.  After around 20 minutes I also began to feel more light headed/dizzy.  I was moved to be observed by a nurse for another 20 minutes and when symptoms did not subside I was moved to the Emergency Department where they administered Epinephrine at 9:27am, Pepcid, 9:24am, Solu-medrol 9:24-10:50am.  Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis. Dr. wanted to prescribe Benadryl IV but I declined as I needed to drive home and the facility was far from home. I was discharged around 1:00pm.   A prescription for an Epi Pen was made by Dr.  and filled that day at pharmacy.  and spoke to my Dr. at another healthcare organization at 4:30pm.  Benadryl OTC was then rx&#39;d by my primary care doctor at 4:30pm-50mg every 6 hrs moving to 25 mg every 6 hours the next day.   Symptoms of swollen throat continued into the next day and have not yet abated but also have not worsened. Due to continued throat swelling I have taken 50mg of Benadryl the next day as well. Dr. my primary care Dr. scheduled an allergist appt for Feb. 3, 2021 and advised I should not get the second dose of the COVID19 vaccine until I speak with an allergist and have a treatment plan developed.

The second one really hurt maybe due to the person giving it . I had a fever low grade till noon 1/31/21. The scariest was pain and swelling in my lower armpit on my left arm where vaccinated. I found a study that it can happen but I freaked out . 48 after I experienced the lymphnodes swelling the pain went away but still swollen . I think this should be listed as people with a cancer history will freak out if they think their cancer is back . Lymphoma or breast . I aldd also read that vaccinated women need to alert their radiologists before a mammogram as the swollen lymphnodes could mimic Breast cancer and lymphnodes involvement, which would scare women to death .  Physicians should be made aware and the public should be iNformed of the above to reduce panic and unnecessary testing .

This 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3249; dose 2) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at 1:30 PM (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension and mild asthma. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. It was unknown if the patient had COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient took concomitant medications which were unspecified. The patient did not received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took penicillin on unknown dates for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. The patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL0104) on 30Dec2020 at 11:30 AM in the left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On an unspecified date after the second vaccination, the patient had arm very painful, red for 5 days, and swollen and tender left axillary and left supraclavicular nodes. On 21Jan2021, 24 hours after the vaccine, the patient experienced chills lasting three to four hours. The patient did not have adverse effects at all after the first vaccine. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient did not received treatment for the events. The outcomes of arm very painful and red, swollen and tender left axillary and left supraclavicular nodes, and chills were recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient received her first COVID vaccination today at 8:30 pm.  Within 15 min of injection, she began to look distressed and reported sensations of tingling in her elbows and behind her knees. No SOB, facial swelling, or heart palpitations.  It was felt she may be nervous and she was given water and monitored closely.   Vitals  taken with O2 100%, HR 58, BP 134/89 Pt received Benedryl 25 mg when she began to note mild erythematous blotching on neck   10 min later vitals stable with bp 138/82 and pulse 62   Pt was given a second 25 mg dose to take if any symptoms worsened on way home- she was driving therefore I did not want to give her another dose at the time.  She understands to call for emergency care if any SOB, facial swelling, or any distress   Pt confirmed at 10 pm that she made it safely home with some improvement in her symptoms.  I will follow up with her in the morning as well and will complete a VAERS report.  I have educated her that at this time CDC would recommend not receiving the second vaccination, given potential allergic reaction within first 4 hours.  We will review this again tomorrow     I communicated with patient morning of 2/25/21- she states still mild tingling of arms but no new or worsening symptoms.  She feels this is more consistent with anxiety and hesitant to not receive her second dose. I suggested she discuss with her primary care provider before her next visit and if she were to proceed with her second vaccination, I would suggest someone being with her to drive and she take 50 mg of benedryl 1 hr prior to vaccine.  She was appreciative.

                                                Severe pain and swelling of lymph nodes under the right armpit and right side of breast.  Pain level was a 9 on a scale of 10.  Feels like a golf ball is there but not to the touch.  I barely slept the first night.  I thought I was imagining the swelling but took pictures to compare left and right arm.  Swelling is definitely noticeable.  I didn&#39;t have Tylenol in the house so I used a wet wash cloth underneath my right arm pit to ease the pain.   Helped a little bit but not much.  The next night I used a refrigerated Gatorade bottle underneath my arm which worked much better.   3rd night I finally was able to get Tylenol and that seemed to help more so but I am still swollen and painful but now more tolerable.

Immediately afterwards, patient was dizzy, flushed feeling, tingling of my lips, and swelling of the right side of my face. These symptoms were not enough to seek medical attention but were there. After that, I had swelling down my arm and into my right hand, up my neck and face, up and down the right side of my back. I have been extremely tired and weak feeling. Some improvement but I am still really sore and the RSD is starting to act up. I have called into work, been eating well, drinking a lot or water, moving as much as I can, and using Advil and Tylenol for pain management.  Called into work for three days.

                                                3/18: Upon receiving the injection, nerve tingles began in my left arm, wrist and hand. My jaw and neck became very sore and two small bumps appeared on the back of my neck. The bumps became very sore and my lymph nodes began to swell. All symptoms were on the left side of my body, which is the side I received the injection.  3/19: The two bumps multiplied and I had them behind my ear, in my hairline, on the back and front of my neck, trailing to my shoulder and a patch on my back. The bumps were painful and hot. I vomited 4 times that day, ran a 100 temp for a short period of time, had chills, body aches, very swollen lymph node, mild headache, and a very stiff, sore neck. All of this occurred on the left side of my body.  3/20: The bumps continued to increase in size, pain and number. The swollen glands, sore and stiff neck persisted. I was very tired and felt nausea at times.  3/21: I woke with an extremely sore and stiff neck, sore throat and new patches of bumps. I sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with Shingles. I was 100% healthy prior to the shot. I&#39;ve never had Shingles before. I am now on medication to treat the outbreak.

                                                The morning of the 11th, I woke up quite nauseous and felt sick for a couple of days.  On the 22nd I woke up with very swollen lymph nodes above my left collarbone and in my left armpit as well as a dull headache.  I also had a dry, hacking cough.  Tuesday, the 23rd, the swelling was quite uncomfortable and prompted me to go to the doctor -- he did a chest x-ray and bloodwork, I&#39;m going in for an ultrasound on my lymph nodes on Thursday, 24 March.  The swelling in the lymph nodes has gone down a bit, to the extent that I can now lift my left arm, however today (Wednesday, 23 March) I woke up with a fever (102), extreme nausea, diarrhea, the headache is gone and the cough has subsided, but I cannot eat -- I&#39;m drinking water and taking Tylenol for the fever.  My pulse ox has been fluctuation between 90 - 94 all day; I am extremely exhausted and waiting for the fever to break.

About 10 minutes after receiving vaccine, she felt warm but she had a coat on and her eyes started to hurt and she felt tired but she works night shift.  She felt this was normal for working the night before and having stayed up to get the vaccine.  After her wait period she went to her car and remembers feeling warm for having to walk in the cold.  Her right side of face became reddish purple and warm.  She sat in car for a few minutes.  As she drove her face started to swell and turn all red.  When she arrived home she had heavy pressure middle of face-nose area.  Her face continued to turn reddish purple with a rash on right side of face and down to her neck.  She felt her sinuses and throat swell with irritation and in throat and wheezing.  Her mom is a nurse and they waited to see if it worsen or got better.  She decided since she could breath she would not go to hospital. After about 5 hours she felt much better.  She continued to have a headache for 4 days.  She had swelling and soreness of left arm for a couple of days.  She continued to go to work.

                                                After the awcond vaccine:  Woke up at 4 am the next morning with body aches, chills, nausea and a mild headache that was intermittent.  I had malaise and fatigue.  I took some cold medicine 3 times in the course of 24 hours and woke up the next morning with none of those symptoms but did have lympadenopathy under my left arm that decreased through the course of the day.  It was painful to touch and tender once the lymph node decreased in size.  The only other reaction was the site pain and tenderness and warmth.  That lasted a few days.

                                                &#34;I received the Pfizer Covid vaccine Wed afternoon around 4pm. Thursday morning around 9:30 I started with severe pain in my left leg. The pain worsened through the day and my leg began swelling. No other symptoms at all. This morning my leg was twice the size of my right leg so I went to the ER. I live in so I&#39;m at ED. I have a massive blood clot running the the length of my leg - from my thigh to my ankle. I&#39;m very lucky I got here so fast! I?m a very healthy 49 year old with no history of DVT or blood clots so they dug further to find out why. A cat scan showed I have a congenital condition called May Thurner Syndrome. I?m so relieved to have an answer and it?s fixable! The vascular doctors are not 100% convinced that?s not all that was going on as I was born with the syndrome and I?ve gone this long without a clot. So they are doing lots of labs to see if anything else shows up. This is where we are at. I?m being admitted to take care of the clot.&#34;

                                                About 3am the next morning I woke up to a loud ringing in both my ear.  When I sat up I was very very dizzy.  I got up and showered and my feet swelled very bad.  I did not feel well but I went to work but the feelings never got better.  So on 1/10 Sunday I went to the medical center because I jjust didnt not feel well.  The swelling in the lower legs was still there so I was prescribed 20 mg of presnisone for 5 days.  The sound changed during the time of the antibotics but after I stopped taking the prednisone the ringing sound came back, my left foot is still numb and my eyes are constantly red and burning even after putting drops in my eyes, I still suffer from headaches and if I turn my head too far left or right I get dizzy still to date.  On 1/14 I was given a 60 mg dose of tapered predinosone for 2 week to help elevate the symptoms but it did not work.  On 2/12 I saw an ENT specialist who performed a hearing test which did produce minor hearing loss and was diagnosed with having Tinnitis.

I had chills, joint achiness, fatigue, foggy headed feeling, a runny nose, sinus pressure, headache, chest tightness and pain, arm pain, stomach pain, lymph nodes in my left armpit are sore (after 10 days), and I now seem to have a worsened allergy to dairy and a new allergy to nuts - I get very phlegmy, cough, and have chest pain and tightness.   These symptoms lasted for 5- 6 days and the allergies with their symptoms and sinus pain and sore lymph nodes have continued.

                                                anaphylaxis; throat swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 50-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, lipids (as reported) and asthma. The patient was known allergies: codeine, iodine, shellfish, latex, and cefatrizine propyleneglycolate (CEFTIN). Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in hospital. The patient experienced anaphylaxis and throat swelling on 22Dec2020 with outcome of recovered in Dec2020.  The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment of epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, observation was received for the events.    Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis and throat swelling cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A contactable a 50-year-old female Registered Nurse reported for herself that she received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:40 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced headache, muscle ache, joint pain, left arm was sore for several days too on 17Dec2020; not feeling well, sore, runny nose, sore throat, swollen glands, sweats, chills, feeling like she was hot and cold, dry throat, nausea, a little stomach upset on an unknown date. The detail clinical course was provided as following: the nurse reported side effects and want to verify if side effects that &#34;keep coming and going back every couple days&#34; are &#34;normal&#34;. Received first dose last 17Dec2020 and felt side effects on the evening. Returned on Monday last week, lasted until Friday, and back on 06Jan2021. The patient had developed a runny nose, sore throat, and feeling like she was hot and cold. She said she had sweats and chills, but no fever. She said she kept getting a warm sensation, and checked her temperature several times, but did not have a fever. She said she had a super dry throat, and her throat felt like a desert. She said she had swollen neck glands, clarifying the swollen neck glands were underneath her mandible. She said she had nausea, and a little stomach upset with no diarrhea. She said she was still not feeling well in her stomach. Reported last week she had 3 days with a nonstop headache, swollen glands, and a sore throat. She said the headache, swollen glands, and sore throat went away, but are back again, 06Jan2021. She said she was thinking what she was experiencing was more a side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine than being ill because her symptoms went away and now were back. She said when a person was ill, the person got through the illness, and that was it, but her symptoms kept going away and coming back. Clarified the night of 17Dec2020, she had a headache and some muscle aches and joint pain, specifically in her neck. She said her left arm was sore for several days too. She said everything went away. She said she started feeling sick again last Tuesday, 29Dec2020, and felt ill through Friday, 01Jan2021. She said over the weekend she felt fine, and then on 06Jan2021, she was feeling ill with the same symptoms of a headache, sore throat, runny nose, and swollen glands. She said she thought it was odd that the symptoms came back again. She said maybe what she was experiencing were not side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine, and she was ill. She said it was odd that she felt bad and then felt better, and then the symptoms come back again. Reported she can work through her symptoms, clarifying she had mild symptoms. The event outcome was unknown. All events were reported as non-serious. The events did not require a visit to: Emergency Room or Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None. Relevant Tests: None. Treatment: Declined any Reported she was scheduled to get her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 07Jan2021.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

She was subsequently positive but due to dehydration and diarrhea she came to the emergency department where she was admitted for remdesivir and dexamethasone.  She was able to be weaned off any supplemental oxygen.  Her diarrhea resolved.  She is feeling well and will be discharged home in good condition.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142 (also reported as EL0140, pending clarification), expiry date: 03Mar2021 (also reported as 31Mar2021, pending clarification), intramuscular on the right arm on 08Jan2021 06:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heartburn, hot flashes, Grave&#39;s disease (father also has Grave&#39;s disease), had a thyroidectomy in Dec2015, menopause, weight loss, and appetite control, allergies, compromised immune status (brother and father side with autoimmune), respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity, and diabetes type 2 diagnosed in 2019 (both parents and brother also with diabetes). Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) in Dec2015 for Grave&#39;s disease and had a thyroidectomy, esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE SODIUM]) on 02Jan2021 for heartburn, phentermine for weight loss and appetite control, estradiol on 02Jan2021 for hot flashes and menopause, medroxyprogesterone acetate (PROVERA) on 02Jan2021 for hot flashes and menopause, prednisone for unexplained whelps (pending clarification), and cimicifuga racemosa (also reported as black cohosh) for hot flashes. The patient previously took metformin and experienced GI upset (she quit taking metformin/it was causing GI upset because they increased dose/current dose is 1,000mg twice daily increased from 500 mg twice daily) and generic levothyroxine sodium and experienced feels like crap. The patient had no previous history of immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the bnt162b2. No prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of the Covid vaccine after experiencing adverse events. On 08Jan2021, the patient experienced some injection site soreness, in which she took TYLENOL for. Around 14:30, she noticed that the injection site began to itch. Around 16:00, the injection site looked like &#34;a small pox vaccine,&#34; in which appear red and scabby with a blue dot in the middle. The patient also reported, &#34;scar that I have on my arm, it is not a reaction, it is an old scar that I forgot that I have there, it just swelled up really bad.&#34; Event injection site looked like a smallpox vaccine was assessed as serious-other medically important condition. No emergency room or physician&#39;s office required. Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of injection site soreness. Outcome of the event injection site looked like a smallpox vaccine was not recovered. Outcome of the events injection site soreness, injection site began to itch, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site scab, vaccination site discoloration, and old scar that I forgot that I have there, it just swelled up really bad was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect BNT162B2 to the event vaccination site discomfort cannot be excluded.

I was sweating and face was flushed.  I was given Benadryl 50mg PO and lay down for an hour at work.  I went home at 2:30p.  The following day I went to work but at 12:00noon I was feverish (100.0F), dizzy, SOB, all-over sore muscles and my blood pressure was 200/100 taken twice by nurses at the facility.  I was taken to the ER by car and had labs and work up in the ER.  They were unable to determine if symptoms were vaccine related or not.  I had taken first dose of hypothyroid medication on 1/14/21.  They diagnosed hypertension and wrote me a script for Lisinopril 5mg PO daily.  I continue to have high BP readings.  My left arm at injection site is sore.  The edema in my hand resolved the first day after the Benadryl dose.

                                                Delayed Localized allergic reaction.  Approximately 24 hours after shot, I developed hives and swelling on cheeks, chin and swelling of lips.  Immediately took 25mg of Benadryl.   Sought treatment at an UTC for evaluation.   I did not have trouble breathing and oxygen saturation was good, always above 97%.  Upon reaching clinic 1 hour later, swelling and redness had gone down.  Doctor diagnosed it as a localized allergic reaction to vaccine.  I was given another 25mg of Benadryl and prescribed prednisone 20mg for 3 days.   Swelling and redness has been intermittent since yesterday.   All swelling and hives are confined to the face.  I have been taking 50mg pf Benadry every 6-8 hours continuing this evening.  It should be noted that I pre medicated with Benadryl the 2 nights before vaccination, the morning of, 1 hour after the shot and late evening the day I received the vaccine.  I knew with my history of allergies I was at higher risk of allergic reaction.   Please note the facial, eye and lip swelling began the following morning,  12 hours AFTER my last dose of Benadryl.

                                                Typical sore arm right away. Next day, I felt something in my throat - like it was a lodged bone. Short of breath and my heart was going faster than normal and short exertion. So I took an antihistamine - Allegra; tums; Tylenol; and took Prevacid.  It didn&#39;t work. I was worried about my heart and that pressure on my throat. I went to my Dr. appt - she was able to get me in at short notice -  and she examined me and did blood work and chest x-ray. Gave prednisone and albuterol . She said my lympyh nodes were swollen on my neck. Symptoms have resolved. And on second dose of vaccine I felt fine. But still have irregular heartbeat but I have a cardio appt coming up. I&#39;m wearing heart monitor - Zeo - I mailed that on the 14 of January.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

                                                Adverse event: 2 of 7 people received a more concentrated dose of the vaccine. One vial of two was diluted incorrectly with less Normal Saline than require. This error was not noticed until person mixing vaccine said they were out of vaccine and did not have enough to get 5 dosages of 0.3ml. Two people mixed one vial of vaccine together demonstrating to the other. It appears the person making the error did not notice they did not have 1.8ml of NS but must have had some air and did not realize it. The error was noticed when all the vaccines were given and one person had not completed pulling up the vaccine. So, 2 of 7 patients received the incorrect dose of vaccine and it could not be determined which two received the incorrect dose. Patient reported next day of having swollen lymph nodes, soreness, chills, slight headache--

Peripheral IV established labs obtained. I do have concern for adverse reaction secondary to the vaccine as her symptoms started she said shortly before an hour after receiving the vaccine is started with tingling in her tongue throat and her body. She has minimal cardiac risk factors. Given she was tachycardic she cannot be perked out. EKG obtained showed no acute ischemic ST elevation or depression. Initial troponin was not elevated. Patient received 500 mL bolus of normal saline she deceived Benadryl and part of Pepcid. While the Benadryl infusion was going on patient reported feeling lightheaded and her heart rate was noted to increase to the 130s briefly. The medications were stopped, the Benadryl had already finished however the Pepcid was not completed. Her heart rate proved quickly and the lightheadedness resolved. Repeat EKG obtained did show some mild ST depression inferiorly. A repeat troponin obtained at 2 hours remain negative D-dimer was elevated to 91 therefore CTA chest was obtained. This showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism there is small groundglass opacity left upper lobe which is likely related to atelectasis do not feel that this is infectious in etiology patient has not had cough fever or chills. She remained on cardiac monitor here without any further tachycardia and her symptoms had resolved. I do believe patient&#39;s presentation is secondary to adverse reaction to the vaccination. She was advised to take Benadryl at home and may also try over-the-counter Pepcid at home for her symptoms. Did not feel that steroids were warranted at this time. She is to follow-up closely with her primary care provider. I did advise if she has new or worsening symptoms she should return to the emergency department and she expressed understanding and agreement with this plan.

ED notes do indicate she had some mild expiratory wheezing but on further discussion with her today this is a consistent finding after being diagnosed with asthma last year (more on this below).  She was monitored for over 3 hours and discharged home. Her itching resolved in the ED, hives resolved about 3 hours after discharge and other symptoms resolved around 24 hours post vaccine.   She did have labs drawn in the ED: troponin and C4 WNL. CBC showed leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and eosinophilia.   No personal history of seasonal, perennial, food, or bee sting allergies; asthma history as below. She did have an episode of bilateral eye swelling in December that was evaluated by her PCP; she was treated with benadryl &amp; prednisone and this took 3 days to resolve. She has no other history of anaphylaxis, hives or angioedema. She was able to show me pictures of this today.

                                                I had the usual arm soreness. Foot pain started on 22nd and worse on 23rd. Left foot hurt the most. This foot was the one that hurt a little before vaccine. It was in the center of my foot where the arch is but inside the foot - an achy pain. It would shoot through my foot with pain if I stepped a certain a way. I was limping a bit. I tried to stay off my feet as much as I could. It continued through Christmas holidays. December 28  -(my PCP) - she thought it was tendonitis - could see a red circle and swelling where most of the pain was. Dec 28 - x-ray of foot was done. There was no fractures  Meloxicam - anti-inflammatory  15 mg daily starting 12/28/2020. Pain continued - trouble walking and started having hip pain and left leg pain maybe from compensating. I saw Dr. on January 7th. He said it was posterior tibialis tendonitis. He gave me a foot brace to wear - around ankle and foot. It helped but I was still having pain. I was still taking Meloxicam every day. A chiropractor and a physical therapist -they gave me foot exercises and leg exercises and that has been helpful - I see them once a week still. Dr check-up on February 9 and he ordered an MRI and I had that done on February 11th. Report says Tendinopathy and not tendonitis. I got the second dose on  January 8th.

Other than immediate onset of a painful injection site no other symptoms occurred until later in the evening.  I started feeling kind of yucky before I left work but nothing specific.  By the early evening I was running a low grade fever and having muscle and joint pain.   I didn?t sleep very well due to  body aches and severe organ pain.  At one point I woke up because my heart was beating so hard and fast I could feel it in my forehead.  My lips and eyes were swollen and my neck was visibly swollen as well, I think due to the lymph nodes in my neck.  My throat was some swollen but not enough to cause a breathing issue.  The heartbeat issue didn?t last terribly long.  I took a Benadryl to try and stop the reaction.  I ran fever of a 102 give or take a few degrees either way for 2 ½ days.  In addition, the injection site and whole shoulder area was swollen and  hot with redness that wrapped around the front of my arm.&#34;

                                                Patient reported a large fluid filled sac with a marble size lump.  Patient reported she worsened for approximated 4 days then slowly started getting better.  She massaged regularly to help lessen the size.  At 3 week follow up, we were able to confirm she had a swollen lymph node surrounded by fluid filled sac.  Patient was confident it was getting better.  I advised to run this past  a physician but felt it would be ok.

                                                Appx 24 hours after the injection, the site of injection started itching very badly and a bright red solid spot appeared and a lump that was sore to touch.  Redness was just smaller than a quarter at first. That was about 5:10pm 3/5 and then  appx 8-9 hours later, while sleeping, I developed a severe cough and my nose was completely stopped up. Eyes were itching with drainage too. My husband got up and gave me a Benadryl and that calmed everything down so I could sleep again.  This morning, my eyes were pretty red and still had some drainage. My cough is there but very faint and less frequent. My arm hasn?t stopped itching and the red spot is slightly larger at appx 1.5 inches tall and 1 inch wide. Still with a lump and soreness. I expected the lump and soreness.

Right front side a rib pushed out. Slept sitting straight up, could not put pressure on my spine at all. Spouse drove me to the chiropractor on 3/1/21 to have the rib adjusted. Six hours later my heart was literally pounding out of my chest for about a minute. Next day the swelling started to subside and can breathe again. Could lean back on my spine without any issues. Chiropractor on 3/3/21 and will go back next week. Intestines are still gurgling and 3/12/21 experienced diarrhea.

                                                Immediately after receiving the injection, I experienced a headache right behind my eyes (similar to sinus headache); after approximately 15 minutes, I experienced a ringing in my ears.  I told the attending person, but she said it was probably due to being anxious about getting the shot.  I left after being in the waiting area for 30 minutes and began driving home.  My face felt very warm, so I opened the car window.  I touched the side of my face and felt hives.  My tongue felt thick, but I did not feel hives going down my throat.  My torso started to itch and I had hives there as well.  There was no raised area at the injection site.  I became very itchy on my head, neck, and arms.  When I arrived home, I took a dose of benadryl.  Four hours later, I took a dose of zyrtec.  My hives subsided and my tongue returned to normal, but I was still itchy.  The next morning, I took a dose of claritin and called my doctor.  In the afternoon, I took benadryl.  In the evening, I took zyrtec.  I continued this for 2 more days.  The day after my vaccine, a node between my thumb and forefinger on my left hand was swollen and painful to the touch.  My hand was swollen and my finger joints ached.  I went to the doctor for an examination.  The swelling and pain in my hand continued to worsen during the day and overnight.  I kept ice packs on my hand and it felt better after 3 days.

A 50-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date) at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. During her 15 minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience throat tightness. Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to blood pressure abnormality, chest pain, collapse, hypotension, increased swelling, rapid progression of symptoms, respiratory distress, skin changes and tongue swelling. Treatment included: antihistamines. Follow up response to treatment: excellent. Patient discharge: Stable to go home and follow up with PCP. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be excluded based on the plausible temporal relationship and product safety profile.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ehics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 05Mar2021 she began to have arm pain.  48 hours later, patient&#39;s arm started really hurting her, something about her arm being sore on the day of injection and reporter said she was going to be sore and when she got back from going away for the weekend, she thought uh oh, there was a problem here, this was not normal, not right. On 10Mar2021, she experienced swells arm swelling and went to urgent care which was diagnosed with swollen lymph nodes and given Cheplex prescription at urgent care. 11Mar2021, daughter was admitted to hospital by her provider. Daughter was found to have blood clots in arm and continued swollen lymph nodes. Daughter was given IV cheplex and Eliquis while in hospital. Daughter will have to be on Eliquis for next 3 months per reporter. The patient had her first vaccine, Pfizer, and became ill with blood clots, swollen lymph nodes, and wound up in the hospital. Reporter stated that she and the patient were worried about her getting the second shot. The patient was on blood thinners and was seeing a pulmonary doctor and hematologist. She didn&#39;t know about her getting the second shot and thought this should be reported. The patient was due for the second vaccine next week on 26Mar2021 and she was still sick, should it be postponed or what? The patient went the night before the hospitalization to the Urgent Care and the doctor prescribed Keflex, an antibiotic and saw her primary care doctor the next morning and she put her in the hospital. Reporter stated they were getting nervous and wanted to report for side effects. She stated the patient was home from the hospital but still sick really bad. The patient went to Urgent Care 10Mar2021, saw her primary care 11Mar2021 and was sent to the hospital 11Mar2021. Reporter later clarified that the patient was sent to the Emergency Room and after a few hours, she was sent upstairs to be admitted for a 24 hour hospital stay. The patient received Eliquis; Keflex as treatment. Fluids at the hospital, unknown type. Reporter stated they decided the patient wasn&#39;t doing really well and went to the Urgent Care that night and were given Keflex because they felt there was an infection. When they discovered it further that there were blood clots, the patient was told to stay on the antibiotic and given fluids and put on blood thinner, Eliquis, states patient had never been on a blood thinner before. Patient was admitted on 11Mar2021 for 24 hours. Reporter stated that they kept the medicine going and then felt she was stable enough to be discharged the next night at around 18:00 to continue with Keflex antibiotic and Eliquis for 3 months. Reporter stated they were told to contact a hematologist and pulmonary doctor for the nodules in her lungs and to contact her primary doctor if not doing better in one week, but they will probably contact her tomorrow.

Noticed my Heart rate was very high constantly between 100-115 ( on my wrist monitor) * On 4/5 Woke up and told myself to get moving for day, arm was turning very red at this point and swelling bad along with armpit along edge and was hot and still painful. Was up for 7 hr.. I got in shower that evening  and felt weird midway and my head felt like a whoosh and thought I was going to pass out (normal temp in shower) held onto shower got out was fine for about 20 min and then I started extreme shaking uncontrollably and teeth were chattering from chills. Went to get a Tylenol because I knew something was not right and within 30 min started sweating profusely with fever (I didn&#39;t even get up because I felt so crappy) *4/6 Woke up, felt a little better, arm, armpit and side of armpit red, hot and swollen still. Was up for 9 hrs, but when I went to bed and laid down, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe well...something told me to take a deep breath and I felt something like a pop in chest and then I felt like I was breathing better. Was not still feeling good  on 4/7  but went back to work, on 4/8 felt a lot better, then woke 4/9 with Migraine and felt terrible and my heart felt weird...I  called the Health Department and asked what to do and they recommended going to doctor... but a Nurse followed up with me which was very nice. Went to doctor and my Blood Pressure was 179/98 at that time. They ran blood work and prescribed me a antibiotic for my arm and armpit area. I want to add as well, not sure if this matters, but my shot was not in center of arm...it was closer to inner part of upper shoulder closer to chest.

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season belreathing, and a slight headache on my rr temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At approx 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At approx 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I have notice much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopefully, all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night. I have a history of whooping cough. And gastric bypass.

                                                Got my second dose of Pfizer, 12 hrs later developed  fever (103 F), chills, myalgia, headache. Fatigue, bilateral orbital pain. No visual problems. Took Tylenol every 4 hrs and fever (101. 5)returns in 1-2 hrs. Pulse ox remained normal, 98%, but pulse was 99/min. Usually my resting pulse ox is 55/minutes.  Was unable to go to work and see patients.  Had these symptoms for 48 hrs even though stayed in bed, took Tylenol around the clock and drank plenty of fluids (2-3 liters of water in addition to natural orange and apple juices). Never lost appetite either, do eating my vegetables and fish diet. Ice cream help between Tylenol?s. Completely resolved after 72 hrs. Now still have  LEFT  injection site tender deltoid and left axillary tender nodes, improving as well. All along breathing fine, no cough or congestion or sore throat. No anosmia  or dysgeusia.  This was after my second Pfizer dose.  After the First dose only had tenderness on the RIGHT deltoid muscle injection site and tender axillary node, resolved by now.

I went to bed early and slept later than usual and after about 9 1/2 hours of sleep, the headache and fatigue were only very minimal.  On 1/22/21 when I woke up I had an enlarged lymph node under my arm about 2 inches in diameter.  The lymph node was enlarged until 1/27/21

I do not think it wise to be there for my shift in the next 8 hrs. I will stay and observe for additional  symptoms.     I was on vacay and had out-of-office notice set for my email. I discovered this email yesterday while catching up on emails.  I immediately called her. She described the details of the events; stated she has not sought medical care; all symptoms resolved spontaneously but still has some intermittent, mild SOB&gt;   She sent me this email describing the reaction: Here explanation of the reaction:     Thank you for the follow up. Below is a list of symptoms I experienced after I received my initial dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I am scheduled to receive my 2nd dose next week on the 13th of January.   following up:   I received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45 min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season breathing, and a slight headache on my rt temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At ~ 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At ~ 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I noticed much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopeful that all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night.&#34;  I advised she contact her PCP to determine if follow up is indicated given persistent, intermittent cough and SOB.

Pain to injection site upon waking; I took Tylenol 8 hrs and drank 20 oz water.  02/03/2021 at 130am running nose and nausea started.  At 9am I took some alka seltzer cold tabs.  At 5pm I realized pain to right arm was worsening after full inspection I recognize swollen axillary lymph nodes; entire arm pit is swollen. I applied moist heat compress throughout the night and took more Tylenol. I hydrated with water and just layed around resting my body.  02/04/20 swelling continues with some decreased visible; pain to right arm  pit continues and nausea continues.

                                                Developed ache in arm of injection-site - but NOT at the site itself - rather all around it from elbow to neck to scapula. Started about 12hours after injection (woke me at 4:00am). Then over the next several hours developed fever up to 101.5, ibuprofen reduced only to 100.4. This cycle continued through the following day, when temp peaked at 102.2 around 48hr post-injection. Added Tylenol to the ibuprofen, temp then decreased to 100.4. Woke the third day with un-medicated temp between 99-100 all day, but L axillary lymph nodes now swollen. Spent all 3 days on couch, resting and pushing fluids. No GI symptoms at all.  Day 4 - Temp normal, but slightly dizzy. Pain and some edema from elbow to scapula to neck continued throughout and still continues now. Axillary lymph nodes still swollen and sore. Some nasal congestion, still a bit dizzy. Never had any pain (just tender to touch) at the actual injection site.  Also, I never had any symptoms at all with the first injection. I see nowhere else to put this - I received the injection at my workplace.

                                                Ten minutes after, I had sharp pain on my left temporal and they took my vitals. BP was elevated. They asked me what are my allergies and medical history. I couldn&#39;t remember - so had brain fog at that time. My left ear, face, and neck (left side of head) is numb at that time. The symptoms were the same for two hours. Memory remained fogged. An hour or so after the incident - I called the advice nurse from medical clinic and I did remember the doctor&#39;s name. Pain on head and numbness remained for days. My auto-immune system was stimulated my doctor said. Everything kept cascading down -  now I&#39;m on post surgery 9 days and I&#39;m on disability. I went to ER on January 18, I was complaining of  left sided numbness, vomiting, headaches. Facial numbness (left), mild headaches. Left sided headache progressed to (similar to prior migraine headaches) migraine like. January 29, I emailed my physicians (in between the 17th and 29th). On the 29th, I went to see the doctor - joints - really swollen and painful and I cannot walk. I was given steroid shots.  February 2, - appt with neurologist. February - with Dr. - for painful swollen feet; Feb 10 - appt with Rheumotologist - Feb 10 with Dr - a Specialist - , as well. Right foot is swollen as well as the left foot at this time. Dr. - axperatated the right ankle -he said it was infected. February 11, Dr said I have infected joints and need surgery. They did surgery on February 13th. Dr. the surgeon .  Had surgery at medical facility  for infected ankle. February 15 - discharged home. Appt with surgeon on the 16th. Appt with Primary on the 19th. Appt with my Rheumotologist today.

                                                Initial 48 hour period showed little to no reaction. Then chills and  fever of 101 followed by more chills and low grade fluctuating fever going on over 48 hours.  The unusual event is  that this reaction occurred 8 days after vaccination beginning on 3/7/21. Has not resolved completely yet as of 3/9/21. Because of the delay, I took a covid19 pcr test which was negative.

Couldn&#39;t settle. Approximately 3:30 am, had diarrhea until I had nothing in my system and developed uncontrollable shaking. Finally got some sleep after a hot bath. The next day, no appetite, drank little water and kombucha to settle my stomach, exhausted, feverish, napped off and on all day, right arm began hurting tremendously and right side including jaw and tongue felt swollen, took Tylenol  in the morning and BC Powder pm before bed. Slept moderately well. Monday, napped off and on but started feeling better with only moderate exhaustion around 6 pm, but right arm was in pain. Tuesday, moderate exhaustion, had to nap for 2 hours mid-day, right side of body  including tongue was swollen, arm in pain and entire upper arm muscle felt knotted. Went for a massage and worked out knot quite painfully. Today, moderate to mild exhaustion, upper right arm a bit sore, semi- decent appetite.

A 51-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Jan2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.Medical history included menopause or has been through menopause, Flu shot, hormonal issues, she started with a bizarre virus, whole lymph node response; It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting, she had a little infection and inflammatory markers come back positive. Concomitant medication included probiotics, vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) and vitamin d [vitamin d nos] (VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS]). The patient previously took flu for influenza immunisation and experienced peripheral swelling, tetanus vaccine for immunisation, amoxicillin, and experienced drug hypersensitivity, flagyl [metronidazole] and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient reported adverse events associated with her first Pfizer COVID vaccine shot. She experienced swelling in the upper breast area, swelling and pain in the neck, swelling in the armpits (for about 7 days) that got very itchy for 3-4 days but has since disappeared. She thought on whether to get the second shot of the vaccine considering these side effects since her doctor did not know why this was happening according to her. She thought she would report some side effects after one shot of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. It was strange. She did not read the symptoms until seven days out. Then she saw some have reported a lot less. After the shot, that night she had swelling in her upper chest. She thought it was lymph nodes in the breast and chest area on the side she got the shot. The next day her arm that she got the vaccine in got very large. Then, she does not know if it was related, two days later she had itching on both of her feet. It was the tops of her feet and only for a couple of days. She is not counting that. Day five after the shot has been the main problem. Her armpits started itching like crazy. It was severe itching and swelling in her armpits. The itching lasted for three to four days. The lymph nodes in her arm are still swollen. It was five days after the shot. It was both armpits. The night of the shot she had a lot of neck pain and she thought it was probably the lymph nodes in the back of her neck. That has lasted and was slowly diminishing. The patient was not planning on getting it. There was an agency that for assisted living for people that need help. They were giving it and had extra doses. This guy in charge at the assisted living house offered it to caller and caller&#39;s husband because her and her husband run a behavior health counseling. He offered it to them as healthcare professionals. He was given a batch for the residential agency but had extras. She was going through menopause or has been through menopause. She has hot flashes and has hormonal issues. The first week of December she started with a bizarre virus. She got tested for COVID and it was negative. It was not a rapid test it was a sendoff. Through that illness she had a whole lymph node response which was super unusual. The doctor said it was really strange. It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting. She had recovered from that and was back to normal. Four days before she got the shot all of that had resolved. Prior to getting the vaccine she had been tested for Lymphoma and it was negative, and she had a little infection, and her white blood count was normal. She had inflammatory markers come back positive prior to getting the vaccine. She went to the doctor on 27Jan2021 and asked if she should get the shot. The doctor said to do it because if she got COVID it would be worse. She was going to have a follow up with doctor for the ongoing stuff and he might do more test. Never in the course of any of that did she have itching armpits or swelling that lasted all this time. She never had chest swelling. The shot in the arm and it moved across her chest. It was reported that, back in the 90&#39;s, in 1993 or 1994, flu shots caused her arm to swell really large and stayed swollen for three months. That was the last three flu shots she got in the 90&#39;s. Then the doctor said not to get them. No one said why. She doesn&#39;t have allergy to eggs or anything that she knows to cause that. She has gotten all other vaccines and tetanus within the last 10 years. Her arm would kind of react but not like that. It went away in a reasonable amount of time. She didn&#39;t get a fever. The patient does not have NDC, lot and expiry for flu shots, other vaccines or tetanus to provide. When her kids were younger, they all had to be vaccinated for rabies. She did not have any reaction at all with those vaccines. She has allergies to antibiotics. She does not have lot numbers, NDC, or expiry for the antibiotics she was allergic to. She was allergic to Amoxicillin, Flagyl, Doxycycline, and Sulfa drugs. She has allergies to adhesive and contrast dye. No food allergies. She has allergies to dog and other environmental allergies. She does not take any medications for any of that. She has never had any anaphylactic shock of any kind. It has always been hives.

On Friday, 1/8/21 at 830pm I began with severe abdominal pain, low grade fever, nausea and loss of appetite. My abdominal pain persisted and worsened over the next 24-36hours. I presented to the ER on Sunday, January 10, 2021 at 8am with severe right lower quadrant pain, pelvic pain, nausea and low grade fever. I was promptly diagnosed with appendicitis and taken to the OR at approximately 2pm on the same day.  In the OR my appendix was gangrenous, there was pus in the pelvic area nd fluid in my peritoneum. My appendix was not ruptured. My appendix was removed as well as part of the omentum. I remained in the hospital on IV Metronidazole and Ciprofloxacin for 2 days and was discharged on 1/13/21 at 9pm. I am continuing to recvoer at home on the same 2 antibiotics in oral form. I have a JP drain that is still in place. Of note I had two negative COVID 19 tests on 1/9/21 and 1/10/21. Both were PCR tests.

                                                Lymphadenopathy; mild fatigue; Myalgia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), intramuscular in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at 16:30 as a single dose to prevent COVID. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported and it was reported that she had no relevant medical history. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Dec2020 at 14:00. The patient did not receive any other vaccine/s on the same date as BNT162B2, did not have prior vaccination within four weeks of receiving BNT162B2, and did not experience any adverse event following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced mild fatigue and myalgia on 13Jan2021, and lymphadenopathy on 14Jan2021. Seriousness for the events was reported as serious (medically significant). The patient received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 12Jan2021 at 16:30. She experienced mild fatigue and myalgia after 24 hours which has improved. She clarified that the mild fatigue and myalgia resolved by this morning. She felt lymphadenopathy in her lower neck and supraclavicular area. Stated it was almost fullness she can feel, there was no redness and it was not tender. She was hoping this was related to the vaccine that she got in her left upper arm. She went to the CDC and Pfizer website and saw that lymphadenopathy was mentioned but it was a small percentage. The patient declined any treatment. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room of Physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events fatigue and myalgia was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the event lymphadenopathy  was not recovered. The reporter&#39;s causality assessment between the events and BNT162B2 for the events fatigue and myalgia was related, while for the event lymphadenopathy was unknown.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the events fatigue, myalgia and lymphadenopathy are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Thursday right under my jaw line seems to have swelling. This morning it feels the same.  Burning like irritation in my hair.

                                                Day 6 I felt extremely lethargic, fatigued and with extreme joint pain upon waking. I took lunch at 3:30 pm consisting of  almonds, cranberries and cheese bites and 2 mandarin oranges. Approx 10 minutes after eating I began to cough uncontrollably and had difficulty clearing my throat. Drank water thinking orange juice had gone down wrong.  10 more minutes my bottom lip began tingling, tongue felt thick, chest tightness, light headed. I called clinic who suggested I call for medical emergency because of my previous anaphylaxis. Taken to ED, given epi pen, prednisone, pepcid, monitored and discharged after 2 hours

                                                Within 10 mins I had swelling, tingling and some numbness in my face and neck. I was checked by EMS at the site. Waited another 20 mins and the symptoms did not get worse or rapidly improve. I had a prescheduled doctor appointment and went directly to the doctor&#39;s office after the vaccine. Dr. confirmed that I had swelling and redness in my face and prescribed Methylpredsisolone 4mg 21 pack of steriods to take. That medication removed the symptoms.  On 02/01/21, 24 hrs after the last dose of the pack, the face swelling and tingling returned. As recommended I took Benedryl 2 tablets / 3 doses. I returned to Doctor&#39;s office on Tues 02/02 where she prescribed Presnisone 20mg for 5 days after seeing the swelling in my face and she said my lymph nodes were swollen as well.

                                                chills; temp got to 103.5 (fever); swollen, sore glands to the left side of my jaw, underneath and in front of my ear; swollen, sore glands to the left side of my jaw, underneath and in front of my ear/gland pain; nasal drainage to my left sinus/nostril; inside of her left cheek felt like there were lesions breaking out but there were none; her cheek and teeth were sore, as if she had a sinus infection; her cheek and teeth were sore, as if she had a sinus infection; sinus drainage became blood tinged. It is pale pink in in color,  not constant/bloody drainage; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 52-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension from an unspecified date and appendectomy in 1991. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE). The patient previously took atropine sulfate (SULFAS ATROPINE, reported as Sulfa), quinolones and doxycycline and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported) in the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 5:30PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. On 19Jan2021 02:00, she started with chills and by 24 hours, her temp got to 103.5 (fever). The patient took Tylenol. The temp stayed in the 100-101 range for the next 24 hours. Then, she started to have swollen, sore glands to the left side of her jaw, underneath and in front of her ear. The inside of her left cheek felt like there were lesions breaking out but there were none.  She then had copious amounts of thin nasal drainage to her left sinus/nostril.  Over the next few days, the gland pain subsided but she still had drainage and her cheek and teeth were sore, as if she had a sinus infection. She would occasionally take Tylenol and on occasion, took cold and flu medicine.  Then, her sinus drainage became blood tinged. It was pale pink in in color, not constant, but when the drainage started, it was sudden and just drained with no warning.  She smelled old blood. She turned in bed and the drainage occurred suddenly and she can taste old blood. Almost two weeks later, and she still had bloody drainage. Clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I have a 3 inch in diameter mass of swollen lymph nodes under my left arm (had both shots in left arm).  I read online that this is a sign of my body fighting the vaccine and it is a good sign.  I went to my doctor just to have it checked out and because both of my eyes look like I have pink eye.  My doctor isn&#39;t sure if my eyes have anything to do with the vaccine but said probably not.  She said that I needed to report my mass as it is not one of the most common side effects.  I also went to the health department, where I had both shots, and had them look at the mass.  They said the same thing about my body fighting the vaccine.  My doctor and the health department said that while they have seen the swollen lymph nodes from the shot, they haven&#39;t seen such a large mass like mine.  Both of them said I needed to report this.

It was sharp, stabbing, crushing pain then she would have spasms. She went to urgent care and was given Voltaren and Flexeril. She was taking 1 gram of Tylenol every 8 hours. That lasted two to three days. That started on the 06Jan2021. She thought she was doing great and then on the sixth was when it started. By the morning of the ninth it was over.

The back pain and cough was almost a month now (as of 23Feb2021). She reported no matter what she did she did not get it to go away. She did a zoom call with her doctor because of COVID symptoms and because she took vaccine. She took 1000mg of Tylenol prior to receiving both doses and thought maybe it wouldn&#39;t hurt and would keep her from getting a fever.

Ice made things worse. for cough: it had not been disabling. it was irritating because it had been almost 30 days.  She knows it was different than the COVID cough because it was moist and when she had COVID it was a dry cough. Regarding seriousness of nausea and vomiting: it was debilitating and she couldn&#39;t go anywhere because she was throwing up with every move she made. The pain made it worse. The reporter assessed moist cough, nausea and vomiting, arm pain at the injection area were related to suspect vaccine. No investigation assessment performed.

                                                pt states that she started itching between the left shoulder and left breast.  As she scratched her breast she felt a small bump and noticed a brown spot.  She contacted her OB/GYN via portal to let her know that about these symptoms.  The Doctor advised her to see a Dermatologist.  She contacted her once again since she felt like something was wrong and was told again to see a Dermatologist.  Pt saw Dermatologist  on 3/4/2021 and was told it did not look skin cancer and ordered some cream.  Pt let Dr. know that she had taken the vax recently and that she also has breast implants.  The Doctor did a small exam but did not feel a lump, but this doctor is not an OB/GYN.  Pt went to an already  scheduled mammogram on 3/11/2021 but they would not complete the annual exam since she was having pain issues so she was rescheduled for a diagnostic exam on 3/17/2021.  Pt believes she has felt swollen lymph nodes under her left arm and has had intermittent pain for about 3 weeks now.  The pain seems to move around from breast to her back.

By 30-40 minutes after shot, my face was also flushed and the inside of my mouth (mostly roof of my mouth) and lips were itchy/tingly. Then, I took 2 Zyrtec 10 mg. as instructed by my allergist if I had a reaction. Within an hour, the flushing and itchiness were gone.   2 days later - had strange pain, swelling, and warmth in upper left shin below knee. Worried about possible blood clot, I took 2 baby aspirin. Pain and swelling went away. Not sure if related to vaccine but unaware of anything else that could have been different.

After 2nd dose of vaccine 2/2/21 she took took ibuprofen about 27-28 hours later on 2/3/21 due to aches/headache.  She developed face/lip swelling and tingling.  She was seen by provider via video visit and told she needed to be seen in person.  She went to urgent care and was prescribed EpiPen PRN.  On 2/22/2021 she was having some back-pain and took ibuprofen.  About 1 hour later she developed same response with face swelling/tingling.  She does feel her reaction is caused by the ibuprofen but she reports this being a new reaction since the vaccine since she routinely took ibuprofen prior to the vaccine.

During this time I had severe pain in all joints from my neck to my hips. My fingers swelled as well. My legs felt fine and no headache. Tylenol and ibuprofen helped my fever but did not alleviate my pain symptoms. My shot was Friday evening. By sunday afternoon my fever was gone as well as the pain in all but my arm. But is was down to manageable.

The pain is constant when area is touched or with any arm movement. It feels like a knife is stuck inside my left axilla. I am guessing it may be a lymph node that swelled, but have not had it checked by a doctor. My last mammogram  on November 16th, 2020 was clear and no indication of any lumps or swollen lymph nodes. This new lump appeared the following day after my Covid 19 vaccine.

Both places were extremely painful (especially the lymph node).  The lymph node finally went down after 3 days. However, the lump at injection site is still large and now it&#39;s hard and it has the area has expanded to a &#34;Covid Arm&#34; rash, which covers my the majority of my upper arm.   I was symptomatic with chills, aches for the first two days and the lump/lymph node issue is still happening and it&#39;s been 5 days.

                                                Eight days after the initial vaccine injection, a painful nodule appeared.  I consumed a large amount of (simple and complex sugar) calories (around 4,000) the night before 3/13/21.  On the day of 3/13/21 I woke up with swelling and noticed a painful lump, the size of a small grape above the left medial clavicle, within the supraclavicular cervical triangle.  Saw my doctor on 3/18/21 and she mentioned that the inflamed lymph node is probably due to the vaccine.  The lump is still with me, the size is the same, however the area in and around the lump  is not as tender and painful today 3/24/21.  This coming Friday 3/26/21 is my  appointment for the second dose of the Pfizer BioNTECH vaccine shot.

                                                Had vaccination shot #2 in right deltoid. Went to the observation area for the 15 minute period. After approximately 7 minutes, I felt my throat &#34;swelling.&#34; I got up and went to the RN who administered shot. They called the RN over. Vital signs were stable, airway intact, able to speak full sentences. No shortness of breath. It took more effort to swallow. Right arm sore. They monitored me for another 15 minutes. No worsening symptoms. Swelling not improving. Recommended going to the ER (I&#39;m an RN and this was administered at my hospital).  Was escorted to ER. Hooked up to monitor. Slight redness noticed on both arms. No hives. IV started. Given IV Benadryl, famotidine, solu-medrol. No improvement. Hooked up to a monitor and given epi sub-Q. Monitored for approximately 60 minutes with improvement of throat swelling. Discharged to home with prescription for prednisone, famotidine and Benadryl x 5 days.  At home, approximately 8 hours after shot, work up feeling itchy, took Benadryl PO with relief of symptoms approximately 45 minutes later.  Followed up with MD on 1/21. No change in medications.  Asymptomatic during the course of medications. Finished course of medications on the morning of 1/23. Later that evening started feeling tired, had chills, swollen glands. Went to bed early. On 1/24 symptoms continued including lack of appetite, increased fatigue, brain fog. Symptoms continued until 1/25 and gradually improved over the week.

At 5pm, I had a headache, my neck was hurting and I began feeling so weak I could barely talk, I couldn&#39;t hold my eyes open. I took 3 Aleve. At 8pm, I started with shortness of breath just going downstairs plus my entire body felt like I was hit by a truck. My 3lb. Chihuahua would get on me and it felt like I was hit by a bat with a ripple effect into the surrounding area. I took 2 Tylenol PMs. On 04/07, at 6am, I woke up to my limbs extremely swollen and throbbing, this included both feet and especially both wrists and hands. My hands were worse than my feet. My left wrist/hand also had tingling. I was so weak I could barely get out of bed or talk, this continued through to 5:30pm same day. I called an Urgent Clinic and told her all my symptoms, she said were all &#34;normal&#34; until I got to my wrists/hands and limbs. Urgent Care told me it would be best to be seen in ER and evaluated. I immediately went to ER . This approximate time was 6:30pm on 04/07/21.

A 52-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the age 52-year-old on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hemodialysis for many years, adherent to medical care, multiple DVTs and Pes (On anticoagulants), morbid obesity, Patient was on dialysis for renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant (positive), Afib, allergic to shellfish. Family history included renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant. Concomitant medications included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN); metoprolol; amitriptyline; calcitriol; ergocalciferol (VIT D); calcium; calcium acetate (PHOSLO); amiodarone; albuterol. The patient previously allergic to Cipro, clindamycin, doxycyclin, Lyrica, tetracycline. The patient previously was non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient hasn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient wasn&#39;t smoker/ former smoker. There was no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. A nephrologist who reported patient in her hemodialysis unit who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 but were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. More detail is below on each patient. The patient COVID results were sent to the local health department for genetic sequencing (pending) and SARS titers were drawn (pending). Unfortunately, the HD unit does not have B/L information (although the B/L # was put on the patient&#39;s COVID vaccine cards, a record was not kept in the HD unit). Day she came in for dialysis she was already short of breath she said she&#39;d had body aches for 5 days, got short of breath on 05Apr2021. The day before, started getting cough, nauseous, chills, abdominal discomfort on 04Apr2021. The patient was sent to the ER from dialysis and was admitted for SOB on 05Apr2021 and passed away on 09Apr2021 due to a GI bleed. Patient is over 500lbs so was unable to fit into hospital imaging equiment for CT scans or weight measurements. COVID-19 test was positive on 05Apr2021; the patient experienced COVID pneumonia on 05Apr2021. The patient admitted on 05Apr2021 to regular floor. The patient was moved to an Intensive Care Unit on 06Apr2021. The patient experienced short of breath on 05Apr2021 and required much more O2 than normal. Sometimes required BP support while on Dialysis and BP was 113/61 in ER. Pressure dropped to 100/70 and required mitrodrine after fluid was removed. The patient needed 4 liters supplemental O2 vs. only needing 2 liters at home. The patient experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia and no Respiratory failure. Respiration was 22. After 5 litres of O2 improved. Pulse 93 in ER. Cardiovascular: There was no heart failure, cardiogenic shock, Acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and myocarditis. The patient Had chest pain which resolved when O2 was administered. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic: There was no Vomiting, Diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea and complained of abdominal pain. There was no Jaundice and acute liver failure. Neurological: There was no altered consciousness, altered consciousness, encephalopathy, meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. The patient had headaches a couple days before admitting to ER. Hematological: There was no Thrombocytopenia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. INR was 3 due to large dose of coumadin, and platelets were 180 and white count 6.8. Slight troponin increased at 0.37 at admittance, BNP 39. The patient started coughing up blood, having hemoxysis and bleeding on unspecified date. Laboratory test or diagnostic studies was reported that test for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or other commercial or public health assay. Xray showed vascular congestion with superimposed infiltrate which could represent pneumonia. Blood count was 11 and 36.7% at ER. Clinical chemistry: Sodium was 133; BUN was 68; Creatinine was 10. Evidence of hypoxemia: Pulse oO2 was 90 in ER.  CT scans: unknown results. Urinalysis: On dialysis so does not make urine. The patient had received Remdesivir, from 06Apr2021, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Azithromycin from 06Apr2021 and Corticosteroids from 06Apr2021 for COVID-19.  The outcome of event &#34;GI bleed&#34; was fatal, the event &#34;chest pain&#34; and &#34;body aches&#34; was recovered and other events was unknown. The patient died on 09Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect drug cannot be excluded for the events vaccination failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis. However, the patient&#39;s multiple medical comborbidities including renal failure requiring dialysis, lupus, and morbid obesity along with the risk of COVID-19 infection in light of the current pandemic are the more likely explanations for the development of these infections. The events gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage, hemolysis and troponin increased are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, and are considered unrelated to the suspect drug. The patient is currently on warfarin which may increase the risk for bleeds. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: GI bleed

The clinical course was reported by the patient as follows: When probed for the reason of hospitalization, consumer stated, &#34;The symptoms I had was, I got the vaccination in my left arm, 24 hours after getting the COVID vaccination shot on 13Apr2021, almost exactly 24 hours later my neck started swelling up, my left lymph node, which I was expecting to have that problem. And I could hardly move my neck and then I developed a headache over the whole left side of my head and behind my eye and it was hurting and then it hurt my ear. So, I was having ear ache too. So, that went on for about an hour and a half and then all of a sudden I kind of broke out in the sweat and the left side of my head just went totally numb and then I started feeling tingling in my left hand and so I went to the bathroom to see if my face was numb, to see if I had any paralysis of my face which I did not have any at all, it was just numb. So, then I am concerned, so I decide I am going to take an Aspirin and so before I took the Aspirin I wanted to eat something because I had not had anything to eat that day. I went to eat some yoghurt and I could not swallow at all, I couldn&#39;t swallow the yoghurt. So, then I am concerned my airway is being compromised by the swelling in my neck. So, I got to call # and then I cannot walk my left leg is dragging, so I am lurking around having to hold on and then when I called # my voice was like had to whisper and it was hard to get an information where I was at. Finally they arrived and I was taken into the ambulance and when I was in the ambulance my blood pressure went up and also the right side of my body started shaking, they took me to the hospital. I was in the hospital. I had MRI, a CT scan and all of those things and it was negative for a blood clot or anything, heart problems or brain bleed. So, they ruled all of that out, my white blood cells count was really, really extremely high that is what the doctor said and anyway so I was admitted in the hospital and now I can talk better and the numbness is going away on the 14th a day later which went on for the symptom. So, later that evening the numbness subsided. I could speak better my left lymph node was still sore and everything and of course they did noticed that in the scan, MRI stuff about the abnormal mass in my neck which was my lymph node.&#34;. The patient stated, &#34;I was hospitalized on 14Apr2021 and I was released the evening of 16Apr2021.

After 2 hours of the shot, the left arm began to be noticeably sore.  12 hrs post vaccine, I had flu-like symptoms.  24 hrs post vac, flu-like symptoms continued and the injection site had a visibly 2&#34; swollen, red warm circle and raised area; also, I experienced  considerable  lymph node soreness in left underarm and under jaw (neck area) and itchiness at injection area.   36 hrs post vaccine, the flu-like symptoms subsided, but the injection site continued to grow to 3&#34; red, warm and swollen area.  Also I continued to have the itchiness, sore lymph nodes in the left arm (injection arm).   Today is 48 hours post vac and I continue to have the red, raised, warm and itchy swollen circle at the injection site with soreness in the lymph node glands on left arm.

Lower back at kidney sites are so painful. Weakness. No energy to lift up arms or legs. Have difficult to get up and get out of bed to get medicine or food. So sleepy, maybe because Tylenol 500mg q4h to help for pain but reduce just little from 10 down to 8 for a short time enough to get out of bed to get something.  Ice pack at armpit, heat pat at lower back but just reduce the pain from 10 down to 9 only. No appetite. Eat lentil and rice porridge but indigestible and have to take Pepcid. All symptoms prolong until Friday 1/15/2021 around 1pm. I pushed myself hard to get up to drive to employee health for testing which I missed on Thursday due to unable to get up. After that the symptoms down to moderate that I able to report CDC. I wonder why 2 dose is so horrible to me.

Historical vaccine included flu shot in Nov2020 for immunisation. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none. Patient never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. Patent experienced anaphylactic reaction on 22Jan2021, heart enzymes elevated on 22Jan2021, blood pressure was out of control on 22Jan2021, get a tightening in her chest on an unknown date, lingering dizziness on an unknown date, dizziness did not allow her to go to work on an unknown date, inflammation around heart on 22Jan2021, troponin kept increasing on 22Jan2021, fatigue on an unknown date, lightheadedness on an unknown date, left side of temple toward the crown of head she has pressure on the left side of the body on an unknown date. Seriousness for heart enzymes elevated and anaphylactic reaction was hospitalization from 22Jan2021 to 23Jan2021. The events anaphylactic reaction required a visit to Emergency Room, but not Physician Office. The event clinical course was as follows: patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine she had an anaphylactic reaction. She was given 3-4 Epis on site (on 22Jan2021) before being transferred to the ER. In the ambulance, she was administered a 4th EpiPen (on 22Jan2021) before getting to the ER, and then admitted to the cardiac unit on 22Jan2021 for observation.  Patient also reported Given 3-4 EpiPens on 22Jan2021 and EpiPen auto-injector was Lack of Effect. No Return Sample Received. When she first started having symptoms, her blood pressure was 128/73. When the symptoms got worse her blood pressure started increasing. Her blood pressure was 220/116, they had to admit her to the cardiac unit because her heart enzymes were elevated and her blood pressure was out of control. Her troponin kept increasing and had inflammation around her heart. Her symptoms of anaphylactic reaction went away that same day, 22Jan2021, at the vaccination from her anaphylactic reaction. Patient was discharged and released from the cardiac unit on that Saturday (23Jan2021 ) around 7:30pm. No one could tell her anything about this since she was still having lingering effects and was getting ready to locate a cardiologist and still has tightness in the chest. She mentioned the dizziness did not allow her to go to work. She experiences it on and off, not consistent but less severe than initially.

I went to the Dr and she ordered an ultrasound and an mammogram but I didn&#39;t get it because I heard on news that they advised to wait until the swelling had a chance to go down before getting an ultrasound and mammogram. The swelling went down after a week. It was so swollen I couldn&#39;t put my arm down. I will get my tests done for six weeks.

It is now on my hands as well and they are stiff and swollen. Both doctors that I seen suggested going to regular physician before taking second dose of vaccine

The second day after the shot developed swelling in the neck on left side between neck and shoulder area.  Third day lymph node swelling and pain when swallowing.  Arm still red, swollen and hot on third day after the shot.   I have iced down both area which has not helped.  I contacted occupational health as I work at a hospital and received the vaccine there.  I was told to contact my PCP,  which I did and am waiting to hear back.

A 53-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Deltoid Left on 11Apr2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EP7533; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 53 years). Medical history included asthma, Blood pressure high, acid reflux , allergies: Sulfa, Lactose intolerant and allergies: Latex. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a historical vaccine of Flu shot (INFLUENZA) on an unspecified date for immunisation and experienced bad side effects. The patient previously took bactrim, minocycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, demerol, avelox, nitrofurantoin, naprosyn, motrin, perocet, tramadol and aleve and experienced allergies. The patient experienced anaphylaxis on 11Apr2021. It was also reported that she had an appointment for COVID Vaccine at 9:15AM. Received COVID Vaccine and was told to wait for 30 minutes. Within 10 minutes her chest starting getting tight with difficulty of breathing. Her throat was closing up, and she was light headed. She explained this to the administrator who asked if caller could get up to see the paramedic. As caller tried to stand up, she almost passed out. Had to sit there for a second and the second time was able to get up and made it in to the room. Was going in and out of consciousness. Had to stab her with an Epi Pen. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her throat was closing up. Her tongue was swollen. She was in and out of consciousness. First Epi Pen didn&#39;t work. An IV was put in and was given something through it. She was jabbed with a second Epi Pen. Was still in and out of consciousness but she was starting to come back. Was given oxygen and a nebulizer. She does have asthma. Ambulance was called. Was told she was worked on for 20 minutes. When ambulance arrived she was able to get up and get on the cart. She was taken to the hospital. Was given medicine through her IV. Had to be kept at hospital because she had two Epi Pens and medication at the vaccine facility. Hospital wanted to make sure when the Epi Pens wore off she didn&#39;t go back into anaphylaxis. Was kept in ER for over four hours. Was given IV fluids. Her oxygen, heart rate, and blood pressure dropped at vaccination facility. Oxygen was 81. Blood pressure was 94. At hospital, her levels started to get better. Once she was given the second Epi Pen and whatever else she was given, the medication started to work and she had come through.

That area is prone to dry skin.; pretty tired; shortness of breath; chest pain; rash/rash around right arm; Redness in right arm at mastectomy site, and warm to touch; Welts; red bumps; Itching; Nauseated; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 19Apr2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history bipolar disorder, breast cancer, and slightly high blood pressure. Patient had a right mastectomy and had lymph nodes removed from the right side. In the spring, when everyone was mowing grass and it was real humid outside, she got welts on her body. It was temporary and went away. Patient would get really itchy. Concomitant medications included letrozole for breast cancer (the tumor in her breast was powered by hormones. This drug suppressed hormones) from 2017 and ongoing, omeprazole for constant heartburn from an unspecified date and ongoing, propranolol hydrochloride (PROPANOLOL) for anxiety from 2016 and ongoing, clonazepam for anxiety from 2016 and ongoing, and venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) for bipolar disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid on 29Mar2021 11:30 for COVID-19 immunisation and was really tired after the first vaccine. When she was a kid, her doctor put her on steroids. Never happened after age 12. Patient also got the influenza vaccine (flu shot) a couple of years before. The patient experienced redness in right arm at mastectomy site, and warm to touch, welts, red bumps, itching, and nauseated on 20Apr2021. Patient had a right mastectomy and had lymph nodes removed from the right side. In the area where that occurred, it had become red, inflamed, and a little welty. Not all of the welts were raised, they look like they were in the skin. There was redness and it was like someone scratched her and was kind of itchy. She took 2 diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Patient was very sensitive to allergies, but was not allergic to anything. Sometimes she broke out in welts in the spring. Patient got the injection in the left side but the reaction was occurring in the right side. Patient was pretty tired, but she was concerned about the rash. Patient was concerned that the right arm was roughly 2&#34; bigger than the left arm around it. Patient had been measuring the circumference, because nurses were paranoid about things like that. It was usually not 2&#34; more around. Patient woke up this around 10:00 am. Around roughly 12:20 pm, or probably 10 after 12, she looked in the mirror and said there it was. She noticed the itching and thought it was dry skin. That area was prone to dry skin. The welty points of redness that were raised. It looked like someone had scratched across the area. It was red, and might be the end of one red scratchy area might be a bump. It looked like, if were to put hand where the nipple used to be and open up the area. That would all be covered. It included the upper arm and the inside of the shoulder, like the front side of the shoulder. It was raised and welty redness. Not all areas were raised and was bumpy. It was all pretty red and warm to the touch. The itchiness started more after she saw it, which was terrible. Patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride because she was concerned about an allergic reaction. She also had scheduled medications that she took in the morning. Patient took 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride this morning. Patient took at 12:10 pm when noticed these things. At first, she didn&#39;t think anything, she didn&#39;t think like it was the Pfizer shot or anything. It was just a normal day. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride had done nothing for the welts yet. Patient then felt kind of nauseated. It started when we first got on the phone. She couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. Patient went to the emergency room last Monday. The incident had nothing to do with any vaccine. She had chest pain and shortness of breath. They drew all of the labs. If she wanted to know if anything in the labs was different from then and now, she could. Everything was normal. She got an inhaler. They though it might be related to all of her allergies. The only way she would go see a doctor, is if she saw that the arm was getting much bigger, like it grew 2&#34; more. If she had a hard time breathing, she would call 911. Patient had rash around right arm on 20Apr2021, in area of past breast mastectomy. Patient first noticed itching and the redness around 12:20 pm on 20Apr2021. Had gotten progressively worse. Patient did not see in the emergency department and was not hospitalized. Patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Multiorgan were involved. Patient just noticed new area that formed. There were lines coming out of the area and came below the sleeve line. The red rash was spreading. It looked like something invisible scratched it. There was a triangle of three dots with a little scratch mark below the sleeve. There was another dot area on the forearm that itches, just like the other stuff did. Stomach had been feeling a little jumpy. Patient had already eaten breakfast. It was not horrible. Patient would watch it and drink ginger ale. Patient was asking what parameters should be for calling 911. She was home alone. This was not life threatening but if it turned into something bigger or if she noticed getting a bigger rash, she might have to call 911. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Subsided for 6 hours and then 6:30 that evening it returned at 100.7. Again 6 hours later, fever was 100.4.  Christmas day, still had fever around 100. Then again that afternoon. Lymph node swelling underneath the arm. The site of the injection I had a large knot. Very swollen, small bruise, hot, and red. No streaking or red lines. Lymph node underneath the arm was about the size of a ping pong. I did not want to go to the ER. I called the nurse line and was triaged over the phone. I was instructed to take BP and pulse and gave numbers over the phone. BP was a little elevated, but nothing to extreme. I pretty much stayed laying down. It sucked the life out of me. I used hot compress and cold compress on site of the injection. It was late Saturday evening when I decided to see a change in the size of the lymph node. By Sunday, the 27th, there was no fever. Not even on Saturday. By Sunday, the lymph node had subsided as well.  I did get a headache, but it was like a nagging headache. My left shoulder in the muscle area towards the neck area, I had soreness.

                                                At night I felt fatigue and palpitations and could not sleep. Next morning the palpitations and fatigue went away but I start with a rash and very itchy and noticed my face swelling up. I took some prednisone I had home and Benadryl and went to the ER. They monitored me and medicated me and told me to keep with the Benadryl. On the 24th I started with the rash and on the 26th no more rash. My second dose is scheduled on the 13th and I will see my PCP on the 12th to decide if I should have the second dose. I am not allergic to anything and thought I would die on 12/24. I was swelling up in less than a minute after I woke up it was awful. I also have a consultation with an allergist on Tuesday  before the vaccine.

I developed a red itchy rash over the entire body with throat tightening. Went to ER where I was treated with H1 H2 blockers steroids. After being treated and observed for a few hours I re developed the rash and symptoms again requiring further treatment and observation.

                                                Body aches and swollen glands under left arm for first 28 hrs.  After 28 hrs fever built up to 101.2 along with rapid heart beat, increased body aches, pounding heart and sweating.  Symptoms lessoned in the morning.  Fever returned the next evening (Friday 1/15).  Cleared by Saturday except for tiredness.  Entire episode completed by Saturday morning 1/16/21.  No hospitalization or MD visit. Would have visited my Primary MD, but they referred me to the organization administering the vaccine.  Vaccine was given out at work, there isn&#39;t a medical clinic available for employees.

                                                It felt similar to the beginning of an anaphylactic reaction I had a few years ago to a random food (never found out what the allergen was). About 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, my throat felt strange, my sinuses started getting congested, my ears started plugging.  I felt dizzy when walking.  I spent extra time at the clinic under observation.  About 40 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly felt like I was being sucked into a vacuum and thought I was going to pass out.  I alerted the nurses, who checked my vital signs and put me on O2.  My heart rate was normal, my BP was high, my O2 sat was 100%.  After about 5 minutes I started to feel normal, they removed the O2.  They continued to observe me for another 15 minutes, until I felt better.  As I drove home (about 1 hour 10 min after receiving the vaccine), my face and lips became numb.  I continued driving home and the numbness resolved in about 10-15 minutes.  I notified my doctor of the event and she advised me not to get the second dose and to report the event.

Spoke with my primary doctor on the phone as it was after hours by the time I called him who prescribed the prednisone.

This prompted a visit to urgent care and urgent care sent the patient to the ED for stroke rule-out. The ED did not believe patient was experiencing a stroke and administered 10 mg of IM decadron. The patient&#39;s symptoms resided overnight but the next day developed red bumps all over upper palate of mouth. The patient went to her PCP which did not test for strep at this time. The red bumps developed into ulcers with white heads and the patient went back to the PCP which performed a rapid strep test which was negative. The PCP was concerned for mono due to lymph node swelling. The patient&#39;s palate has improved slightly but they still feel fatigued.

The patient medical history was none. Patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cortisone. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine on 08Jan2021 and started having the headaches right after. Still has some pain in the forehead and temples area. Has had neck pain, overall body aches, joint pain, pain in ankles and legs that still happens with getting up and down from sitting position. Overall pain is improved but still there, still has pain in ankles and legs. Got the shot in the left upper arm and having real bad armpit pain and a little swelling there. It has gotten a little better, but mostly hurts when moving and laying down. Has had a cough since she got the vaccine, it&#39;s mostly a dry cough and not really wet and mostly in the morning. She drinks a lot of fluids throughout the day and still has a little cough off and on. During the night her throat is really dry and which causes more coughing which she did not have before the vaccine. They are mostly concerned with the cough and the stuff when read online about the side effects that last about 2-3 days, but these have been since she got the vaccine. They know this is also know and not much known about it or what is normal yet, but they want to know if she could get the second vaccine, would it be okay. It was stated that the seriousness of the events is in the middle of not serious and medically significant. She is worried about the cough since it is ongoing, when reads online the side effects are listed as 2 or 3 days and her side effects have been going on since she got the vaccine which is worrisome. The outcome of the events cough and throat dry was not recovered, event pain was recovering, while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.

My blood pressure returned to normal within 40 minutes but I had a persistent headache for 19 days. After second dose, the headache returned with greater severity and my PCP had to prescribe a course of prednisone to help reduce the pain. There was no blood pressure change with the second dose. I also had profound fatigue and was in bed for 48 hours after both doses. My current condition is that the headache and swelling has resolved on right side of temple after 3 days on prednisone but I still have selling and pain, though reduced on left side. I also had typical pain at site injection and received both doses in my right arm.

The Doctor in place informed that it was a normal reaction.   Everything was going well until I went to sleep. I woke up in panic due to not being able to breath. I felt like my brain, face, eyes, and nose were swelling. My chest was compressed. Then I remembered I didn&#39;t take any medication; therefore, I took two Advil. After and hour, I noticed that by sitting or walking , I began to feel better.  I went back to sleep in a seated position around 4:30.  Not sure if I want to take the 2nd dose. I&#39;m frighten. Have an appointment with my Doctor on March 22nd.

This has persisted for two days so far.

                                                I have been feeling tired since the vaccine and have had a chronic low-grade headache since as well.  Things have been okay until a couple of days ago.  I am a fanatic about skincare.  I developed a water blister-type rash on the right side of my chin ( not in my mouth).  The very next day, my neck started to hurt, and I noticed that my lymph node is swollen on the right side of my neck, just under my jaw.   The blisters have crusted over, but my chin and a bit of my cheek are swollen.

                                                Starting at 5 p.m. on March 18th (two days post-vaccine), pain began in the lymph node area of the left side of the neck.  It became increasingly painful on March 19 in the evening (especially after dinner) and overnight (around 3 a.m.) and more painful in the evening on March 20th after dinner.  On March 20th, I took 800 mg ibuprofen (4 tablets) at 6 p.m. to relieve the pain.  My husband is an Emergency Physician and indicated that is the dose I should take given the pain.    At 1:00 p.m. on Sunday the lymphnodes on the left side of the neck began hurting again (excruciating pain) and I again took 800 mg of ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  This occurred after having lunch (a burger) at noon.  However, at 1:30 p.m. the left side of my face began to feel numb. I had little control of the left side of my mouth and could not close my left eyelid properly.  The numbness lasted for about 20 min and then subsided.  After 40 min (2:10 p.m.) it felt better and I had a few potato chips left over from my lunch.  The numbness started again about 10 min later and lasted about 20 min.  The face went numb again the evening of March 22nd for 20 min despite remaining on ibuprofen 3 times a day.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her husband. This is the first of two reports.  A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 54 years of age), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right on 10Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe asthma which started as a child and then it went away and then as an adult it got severe around 2010 and ongoing, she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She had ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), brain surgery in 2007, low immune system, allergies to cephalosporins, pulmonary and stomach issues; and bradycardia (as her BP usually runs 90/45 and she is bradycardic). Concomitant medications included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR HFA), salbutamol (VENTOLIN [SALBUTAMOL]), and montelukast (MONTELUKAST), all taken for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN], omeprazole, phenytoin sodium, azelastine, ipratropium bromide, fluticasone propionate (FLONASE [FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE]), and ipratropium bromide, salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; prednisone taken for an unspecified indication from 2021 and ongoing as she was on this steroid 2 weeks before the vaccine; and  azithromycin which she takes prophylactically for her low immune system from an unspecified start date and ongoing. She was on a lot of medications period and most are for her pulmonary and stomach issues. The patient previously took propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, and Percocet wherein the patient had drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic shock with these; adhesive from nicotine patch made her arm to get red and swollen (Dermatitis contact). She previously took EpiPen for anaphylaxis. It was reported that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She got her vaccine at a hospital in their clinic and she was transferred from the vaccine clinic to the ER. Stated she was given a shot with an Epi-pen in her thigh at the clinic and transferred to the ER. In the ER, she was given Benadryl and watched for 4 hours. She would state this was medically significant because of airway, breathing, circulation and she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She added that it was kind of weird and freaky. She mentioned that along with that, shortly before she was released from the ER, she experienced a very sore arm where she was given the injection. She heard that was very common so she dealt with it. However as the night progressed, it got increasingly worse, it almost felt like she was punched several times in her arm. It probably started between hour 3 and 4 after receiving the vaccine. She added that she had a very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.  It was not serious, just annoying and it was gone 3 days later. She had injection site bruising on 10Mar2021. She stated that she knows this because she was a nurse, but a lot of times, people experienced this reaction when they are given Dilaudid wherein they  get a warm feeling in their chest, so they push it really slow and dilute it with saline so it doesn&#39;t have the respiratory factor. She stated that this was kind of what the feeling was like for her and it was scary because she didn&#39;t expect it. She stated that the ER team that assessed her said, because she wasn&#39;t used to that feeling, she may have had a panic attack and that may have made it worse. After she was treated, she spoke with her husband and he had the shot two minutes before her and he had the same feeling but he didn&#39;t freak out and didn&#39;t want to appear weak. Stated he told her he had the same feeling and it lasted 5 minutes and then it went away. Stated since she got scared, it made it worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she had a panic attack that made it worse. She stated that of course her husband didn&#39;t tell her that until she was out of the ER, that it does go away. That made her feel better because she wasn&#39;t the only one that experienced that. States he didn&#39;t say anything about it, because he was worried about her,  he said it was a warm feeling in the chest and not being able to breathe but he didn&#39;t want to say anything because she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She mentioned that they weren&#39;t going to let her get the second dose, so she went to an allergy doctor and told them what happened and about her husband having the same reaction and because she was severely immunocompromised. Stated the hospital said they were not giving her the second dose unless an allergist says it is safe and sets a protocol and he had to write a letter to the hospital. Stated she was pre-medicated 24 hours before the vaccine with 50mg Benadryl, 50mg Benadryl the day of the shot and 50mg of Benadryl two days after the shot. Stated she will have full immunity on 14Apr2021. She added that she had a pulmonary doctor, brain cancer doctor, ENT doctor, stated they don&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine, but they are pretty sure she had a reaction but they can handle it with pre-medicating her. She received the second vaccine on 31Mar2021. She mentioned that she was happy to be able to get her second shot. She stated that at first they didn&#39;t want to give it to her because of her reaction but she kept calling. So she went to a hospital to saw an allergist and he had to sign off that it was safe to give her the second shot and under what circumstances. Stated she had the letter from the hospital that she was seen by them and she needed to be pre-medicated and it had to be given at a hospital that had the ability to intervene quickly and she needed to be watched for at least 30 minutes after the vaccine. She mentioned that to go through what she went though, and not be able to get would have been disappointing. Because of her immune system, it is important to get the shot and there was a way around the reaction which worked for her. She added that even having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, she was able to recover quickly. Stated with having asthma, COPD and a low immune system, she may not recover from Covid. It makes sense they evaluated it and came up with a solution and a pre medication protocol and when and how long and she was still able to get the shot because it is important. Answers to follow up questions indicated that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was given the shot and getting ready to get out of the chair and her husband was about to sit down for his shot. Stated she would say the time of the course of the reaction was within under 5 minutes of her injection. The patient required medical intervention with Epi-Pen, Benadryl, and Duo-Neb. The patient was not hospitalized because she was immunocompromised, it was better to watch herself at home and because she had an Epi Pen at home in case she has that sort of reaction returning over a 72 hour period. Stated they instructed her husband and told them if she felt any different to come back to ER. She was not admitted to the ICU. Organ involvement included: Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress. The event required initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure including Epi-Pen, Benadryl, DuoNeb. Patient have a history of previous allergies: Medication Allergies to Cephalosporins, Anesthesia medications: Propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, Percocet: Anaphylactic shock; Adhesive from nicotine patch, caused her arm to get red and swollen. She takes EpiPen as she had previous history of allergies and since she had multiple medication allergies and had a history of quickly going into anaphylaxis, stated her BP usually runs 90/45 and she was Bradycardic. She did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the events being reported. She did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. She has not received any other vaccines around the time of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient recovered from &#39;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#39;, Difficulty breathing, and &#39;warm feeling in the chest&#39; on 10Mar2021; while having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress were recovered on an unknown date; Vaccination site pain recovered on 13Mar2021 and Injection site bruising recovered on 18Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events except Vaccination site pain and Injection site bruising. Relatedness of drug to reactions/events: Reaction assessed for events &#34;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#34;, &#39;very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.&#39; and Injection site bruising: Method of assessment: Global Introspection: Drug result: Related.

This 54-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 at 14:45 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, no known allergies to medications, food, or other products, had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not received any other vaccines within 4-weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had no concomitant medications. On 30Mar2021 at 19:00 the patient experienced extreme fatigue and dizziness four hours after vaccination; six hours post-vaccination the patient experienced mild headache, swelling in hands, fever, and joint pain. The patient further reported the next day she had mild hand swelling, severe fatigue, brain fog and mild joint pain. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. No treatment was received for the events. The clinical outcomes of extreme fatigue, dizziness, mild headache, swelling in hands, fever, joint pain, and brain fog were recovering. It was also reported the patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                The morning after the shot I woke up with chills, total body aches, headache and extreme fatigue. I broke my wrist last year and the ache in that wrist was awful. Motrin helped but this persisted throughout the day. General feeling of being unwell for the whole day and evening. The second day after the shot I woke up feeling better but in my armpit on the arm I received the shot it felt like I had a lump in my arm pit and it is sore. This is still there today, the third day after the shot.

                                                On 1/7/21, seven days after receiving the first vaccine, I noticed a swollen and painful lymph node in my neck on the right side.  The lymph node was about the size of a large gumball.  The next day I started having pain in the lymph nodes of my arm pit on the right side.  The symptoms are still present six days later and I now have some swollen and tender lymph nodes in the antecubital area of the same arm.  I am scheduled to get my second dose on 1/21/21.  I have not had any other side affects that I know of other than feeling a little tired and mild headache on and off but that didn&#39;t seem unusual for me.  The lymph node in my neck seems to be getting a little smaller as of today 1/13/21.

A 55-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included urinary tract infection (UTI) from 06Jan2021 and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), in the left upper arm with no issues. At first, she just had a sore arm on 08Jan2021. Then this morning, on 13Jan2021, she was having chills, enlarged lymph nodes, body aches in her back and shoulders, and a fever of 99.6. It is low grade but does not take much. She has been checking her temperature every 4 hours and it is not any different. She was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) for a few days to ward anything off. Today (13Jan2021), she laid off the paracetamol to see if she really did have a fever. She did not want to mask it. So, she is taking paracetamol for that off and on. She talked to one person who said the symptoms should last 1-2 days. Then another person said they could last up to a week. She hopes that it is related to the vaccine. She will be mad if she gets COVID after doing all of this. Outcome of the sore arm was recovered on 09Jan2021 and of the remaining events was not recovered.

                                                The day after the vaccination I had redness around my whole shoulder and arm. On the third day I developed swelling of my shoulder and neck with horrible pain when I breathe.   I went to urgent care and had an x-ray which was clear and they were treating me for myalgia with Motrin. I refused any narcotic pain medication or a Toradol shot.  The pain never stopped on the 19th I went to Work Force Safety and reported it and I was examined by the nurse practitioner who saw all the swelling and the pain that I was in. That nurse practitioner told me if it wasn?t better in a few days to go to the emergency room to be examined.  On January 23 , I developed swelling and pain went underneath my armpit it?s a burning pain that?s constant since the third day after my injection. My blood pressure was 153/104 and I was having nausea and not feeling well at all. On January 25 the pain and swelling were still there I went to work for a few hours and I went to the emergency room. They gave me lidocaine patch and Zofran for the nausea my blood pressure was 159/103 and I had an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot there was no blood clot but there was lymphadenopathy under my arm hurt and swelling and inflammation around the shoulder. The chest x-ray showed left pleural effusion / Pneumonia. My oxygen saturation was 93 and they wanted to admit me but I am a single mom with a new diabetic 14-year-old at home so they let me go home with a pulse oximeter and a prescription for doxycycline For 10 days.  They called me the next day from the emergency room to follow up with a pulmonologist and cardiologist. On January 28 I saw the pulmonologist who did an ultrasound in his office and saw the fluid on my left lung. He said that most likely because the technique of the injection was so high in my shoulder that they probably had a nerve and I did have the swelling in the lymphadenopathy and all the pain and it hurt when I breathe so I wasn?t breathing correctly and I was splitting my arm against me and that?s how I probably developed plural effusion and pneumonia. I am following up with him on February 4. I still have shortness of breath and my oxygen saturation is 93. I am also on two inhalers that the pulmonologist ordered.

                                                Per patient&#39;s report:  She received her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and developed soreness at localized injection site and felt sleepy, otherwise no adverse reaction signs or symptoms patient reported. On 2-19-21 at 2:30 PM she received her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at a mall.  She reports the lot number of the vaccine was EL9269. She was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the second dose.  She and her husband left and took the car to a car wash where she fell asleep on her way home and her husband woke her up when they got home.  At about 320 or 3:25 PM, she noticed that her face felt puffy and she had a sensation that her face was sliding down, she developed tongue swelling, blurry vision, dizziness, and she reports that she was talking funny/slurring her words.  Her husband got a flashlight and looked in her throat and said that her throat was swelling.  She felt like falling asleep.  Her husband used her EpiPen on her.  The EpiPen worked right away to improve the symptoms.  She took no other treatments at home.  Her husband drove her to the hospital where she slept the entire way.  She never developed rash, flushing, skin itching, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, or joint pains.  She does not know if she passed out, she states it was hard to stay awake.  She reports having some abdominal cramping and churning for the following 2 to 3 days afterwards.  She was discharged from the hospital ED where she was never admitted.  They gave her an albuterol inhaler to use every 4 hours for 6 days after she left the ED.  She went home at about 10:00 PM and went to bed about 10:30 PM.  She woke up at 3:00 AM crying and then fell back asleep and woke up again around 7:30 AM.  She did not develop any local injection site reactions on her arm this time.

Resolved after taking an antihistamine about an hour later. Took 1 Alavert.  Next morning started feeling generally unwell with body aches, fatigue, mild chills.  Took Tylenol or Advil every  4-6 hours for 36 hours after injection which helped    symptoms.  Axillary lymph nodes on injection side became tender and sore in about 24 hours after injection and lasted about a week before resolving.

                                                Thirty hours in, I had joint aches in my spine (mainly neck and low back); low grade fever; nauseated;  headache. I felt like everything was it  was swollen  and tight - I couldn&#39;t wear my watch on my wrist. Almost like lymph system - nothing tight in my arm pits; felt like my pants were too tight in my groin - my body was swollen by my lymph nodes. Developed all kinds of gas in my stomach.  I was having chest pains - 3 or 4 times a month before the vaccine - after the vaccine - I&#39;m having the chest pains daily. That lasted for about 12 hours. Next day, 22nd, I developed diarrhea for 24 hours.  9 days later - I got numbness and tingling started radiating down my wrist into my fingers; lower calf to my feet and I had to go see my orthopedic surgeon - it was radiating down into my feet. He sent me to a podiatrist and he doesn&#39;t know.  Those symptoms still haven&#39;t resolved. When I wake up - it&#39;s a low level and by night time my feet would get so numb and tingly it drove me crazy and then it went into my hands. Went to my doctor on March 2nd - my doctor thought I was having a histamine response in my body. I took an antihistamine - and half my symptoms went away. My esophagus is going into spasms -  and I am trying to see a GI specialist. I was taking Benadryl last week but I got too tired. So I take 2 Benadryl at night now and I&#39;m taking a Zyrtec (generic) at the day - it takes the edge off but doesn&#39;t resolve the symptoms entirely. Eleven day - I developed a floaty in my right eye - a black spot. I went to my eye doctor - it looks like my eye is healthy -but floaty is not going away. So talking on the phone, My throat is starting to swell up and feels like something back there and the more I talk pretty soon I start losing my voice (happening now on the phone). They added to my meds: Pepsid, Viscus lidocaine;  Mylanta after every meal; Pantoprazole;  Sucralfate; gave me another one but I haven&#39;t taken it yet: Hyoscyamine - for really bad spasms and I haven&#39;t had another really bad one since I went to ER (besides taking the antihistamines).  I have seen 5 specialists all together.

                                                About 5 minutes after injection I had stiffness in right hand and neck and shoulders.  The stiffness started to go away at 20 minutes later.  15 minutes after I left test site (35 minutes after injections, my tongue, lips, and face started swelling and had trouble swallowing an hour later).  I ate a frozen popsicle and the swelling in tongue and lips started to go down.  Hours later I took my blood pressure medicine (Lisinopril) I started to have tightness in face and jaw area, burning sensations in ears, jaws and back of my head and headaches.  I contacted health care provider after hours number. They scheduled a video appointment with doctor. The doctor advised me not to take blood pressure and any other medications for another day and to put warm compressor on shoulders to relieve some of the tightness in jaws. I was also advised to call 911 or immediately come to healthcare facility if swelling re-occurred.  A follow up appointment with primary care provider is scheduled on 3/17/21.  I do not have any symptoms at the time of this report, March 15, 2021 at 1:23 pm.

Then that evening took her usual dose of lisinopril and about an hour later noticed tightness developing in her neck and new headache, followed by swelling of lips and tongue.  Took tylenol arthritis which she usually takes for her neck problems, and went to bed, but a couple of hours later developed burning in her ears and jaw, headache persisted, and swelling seemed to have gone down with ice chips.  Lisinopril d/c&#39;d  on 3/14, converted 3/17 to losartan which she started at 5pm and within 2 hours had recurrent angioedema for which she was told to call emergency responders, used EpiPen, discharged from ED after 4 hours with another change in BP medication and Medrol dosepak.   Allergist recommends no further COVID vaccines.

Went to Patient first to get checked out and was prescribed steroids to reduce the pain, swelling and inflammation.

                                                Day of shot developed pain in entire right side(chest area), also acid reflux and nausea. That went away about 12 hours after the vaccine. Ten days after I developed a slight pain in right lateral side that progresses to constant pain in 2 places on right side including under right clavicle. I had pain upon taking in a deep breath. Saw MD after 4 days of these SXS. Performed labs, Chest x-ray and EKG. All were essentially normal except elevated WBC count. Have 2 COVID test which were both normal. Md said possibly some sort of inflammation and suggested taking anti-inflammatories which did not help much at all with SXS. After a few more days the SXS changed to constant chest pain(pressure), SOB upon exertion and pain behind knee. F/U with MD again and it was decided to wait a few more days. Upon suggestion from friend asked MD to perform D-Dimer lab test. The result was 4,400. My normal value should have been 550. Sent to ER. CT of chest, EKG and more labs performed. CT revealed large bilateral pulmonary embolisms in pulmonary arteries. Started on blood thinners. Ultrasound of left leg revealed large DVT. Sent home after 2 days on blood thinners. SXS stopped after a few days.

A 55-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in arm left on 19Feb2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201), at the age of 55 years, as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed 3 years ago, ongoing gastrooesophageal reflux disease diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing hypertension diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing food allergy: allergic to eggs, shellfish, dairy/lactose intolerant, ongoing allergies to environmental: standard- hay fever, dust, mold, ongoing allergies to dogs and cats, contrast media reaction (IV contrast CT scan dye- respiratory distress, throat tightens), urticaria, pruritus. She had Covid on 18Dec2020 and &#34;Covid rash it attached her muscular system. She had muscular pain in the wrist and hip on the right side and mild double vision.&#34; The patient previously took vitamin k 2 and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Toradol and experienced urticaria, influenza vaccine and experienced rash at the injection site, at the age of 34 years (because she&#39;s allergic to eggs). The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 on 29Jan2021 Lot: EL3247; 9:30 AM; Right arm for covid-19 immunisation and she did not have any symptoms whatsoever with the first shot. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. Concomitant medications included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease; lisinopril taken for hypertension; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma; salbutamol sulfate (INHALERIN) taken for asthma; start and stop date were not reported for all.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis on 26Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, throat starting to close/throat started tightening on 19Feb2021 with outcome of recovered, severe rash- latus stranding, purple dots, and hives from face all the way down to toes on 19Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, double vision on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right eye is going cross eyed/left eye is dropping on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right wrist pain increased dramatically after the vaccine on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown for Hand swelling and recovered for Localised itching. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events: Benadryl, Zyrtec, Pepcid, New glasses for double vision, Prednisone 7 day ween. The patient underwent lab tests which included Hematology test on unknown date with unknown results; Immune markers on 11Mar2021 with unknown results. Clinical course: The patient received the vaccine on 19Feb2021at 10:00 AM and five minutes after, her throat started tightening and they put her in observation for another hour and then her throat felt fine and they let her go. Caller confirmed she was not referring to this occurrence as anaphylaxis.  The anaphylactic reaction occurred days later. She mentioned from 19Feb2021-26Feb2021, her symptoms were progressing and then on 26Feb2021, it was full blown out; the actual anaphylaxis was 26Feb2021. Between this, she had severe double vision, severe rash from face all the way down to toes, one eye going cross eyed (right eye), left eye is still drooping. On 20Feb2021, she started having double vision that started with the sunlight and fluorescent lights and the next day she couldn&#39;t see anything without double vision, and her eye started going cross eyed. She still cannot see normally now. She is under eye doctor care for that too. The patient was treated with Epi-Pen into leg and then into the Emergency Room. She received 50 mgs of Benadryl and 125 mg of Solu-Medrol IM injection, but still have to give Epi because her throat was still closing. Her airway was intact and no nebulizer treatment needed. The patient reported also that her hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch. The patient reported that her weight at that point was 204, the she had been on Prednisone for a week, and her weight has gone up to 210 now. After her throat closed on the 26Feb2021, caller reports she gained 7 pounds while on it for one week. Caller stated she was also put on prednisone when she got diagnosed with asthma, reactive airway. She confirmed her throat stop closing immediately after the Epi. The patient was also treated with 25 mgs of Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Pepcid a day. Outcome for throat closing was improved with medication. Outcome for rash was not improved and she is taking medicine to counteract it; itch went away when she took the Zyrtec. Regarding right wrist pain, it increased dramatically after the vaccine. Caller reports it felt like a spiral fracture down the ulna and it started to ache on 20Feb2021, by the next day it hurt a 5 out of 10. By 22Feb2021, she was wearing a splint, it was 8 out of 10, and she felt like she fractured it and it was swollen on the ulnar side. Regarding eye disorder, she is now under the care of an eye doctor for her severe double vision, eye crossing, and eye drooping. The blurred eyes give bad balance and that kind of stuff. The cross eyedness gives her poor peripheral vision and also her depth perception has now been compromised. They say the glasses will fix it. As of 22Feb2021, a new pair of special lenses with prisms were ordered for her. The patient was not hospitalized.

                                                1st vaccine: Approximately 24 hours after vaccine, I developed chills with fever of 100.2, fatigue, total body/muscle/joint aches, migraine headache, nausea, heart palpitations, as well as very sore, swollen arm. Had to spend the day in bed. Most symptoms relieved by the next 24 hours except arm pain and fatigue. 2nd vaccine: Similar, but worse symptoms developed approximately 12 hours after vaccine. All of the aforementioned symptoms, but fever of 101.4 and arm wasn&#39;t quite as sore. As above, had to spend a day in bed.

Numbness, tingling feeling from R mid cheek moving toward R ear. Swelling of the face at this site as well. Paresthesia feeling, abnormal sensations at this same area of the face. These issues continues even to today. Initially, I experienced a H/A on the R sided above my eye which has not been occurring lately. On 1/8/21 I was seen by the NP at and was dx. with Bell?s Palsy. The NP noticed that when I initially speak my mouth doesn?t move properly, but once I get my words started then my mouth moves properly. My smile is noticed to be abnormal. The NP then sent me to ER for evaluation with the dx. Of Bell?s Palsy and because of another potential medical condition there?s a high risk for a stroke. A CT scan and blood work were obtained. A f/u script for a MRI of the brain has been ordered as well. Discharge paperwork states: Bell?s Palsy. Currently, I am taking a tapering dose of Prednisone and Valtrex as prescribed.

That continued for about 15-20 minutes.  At 30 minutes after the injection my voice went hoarse. About an hour after I had a serve bullet like headache in one point in my head, I took Tylenol and lasted for about 5 hours.  I started taking Benadryl (25mg), the headed improved, but when I woke up in the morning the next day I had all over swelling to the the point where I couldn&#39;t make a fist and had facial swelling .  The facial swelling lasted for 5 days. My co worker took my vitals signs but everything was normal. For the next 5 days I had facial swelling that increased, hands got better. I continued to Benadryl . After the 5th day things finally started to get better. I did go back to have my second dose.  I contacted my PCP but he was out of town .

                                                3 hours post innoculation,  sore throat with swollen glands, chills, shaking and a mild headache.  Shortly thereafter, started experiencing uncontrolled itching and my skin was bright red (flushed) from above pubic bone and up to top of my head. (nothing on lower extremities).  No fever (98.1) and no visible rash.   The itching became so uncontrollable, I took 25mg Benadryl and remained taking it every 4 hours until 1/21/21.  A very fine, red rash appeared on 1/20/21 in the early morning.   The rash was, mainly at my fatty areas, breasts, abdomen and hips, but the Benadryl helped to control the itching.  The Benadryl did not take away the itching entirely. As of this morning, the rash has faded, but i&#39;m still itching, mildly, in my abdomen and out edges of my breasts. I am going to try to stop the Benadryl this morning and see how I do.  If not better, will go see my PCP.

Started with upper lip on 1/22/21 and then my eyes were swollen, bruised and painful upon waking 1/23/21 and lasted until early morning of 1/25/21.   My whole face was sore to touch during this time.   I also had fatigue and headache starting 1/21/21 which lasted a few days along with  fever, chills,  body aches and  sore left armpit which started early morning 1/22/21.  I had expected these last symptoms so was not alarmed.  I was not warned about the facial  swelling and that was a bit scary.

Nurse took my oxygen levels and heart rate, below 40. Blood pressure very low.  Called 911.  Put oxygen on me, gave me Epipen, and checked sugar levels.  Next heart rate, a few minutes after first one, 40 heart beats and blood pressure coming back up.  Gave me water and orange juice.  Next check, heart rate up to 88 and blood pressure they said was getting back to normal but don&#39;t remember numbers.  I was still trying to feel back to  myself after a half hour to 45 minutes.  My doctor says not to get 2nd dose in which I&#39;m due on 2/21/2021.  I started to feel back to myself around an hour later.  I did not go to hospital due to me feeling better. After shot, regular symptoms, sore arm, fatigued, lymph nodes felt swollen, and sniffles and sneezing.  No fever.   I called  my physician on 2-1-2021 to let her know what happened.

                                                1/21/2021- First Dose-  Following day mild muscle soreness at site, ongoing fatigue, never feels rested or wants/needs to sleep, a lot.  Noticed abdominal pain, but did not connect the two.  2/11/2021- 2nd dose- Two hours later (approx) moderate pain at site, my head/mind felt &#34;off&#34;, out of sync like one side of brain slower,  affected balance. It was strange, and unpleasant.   2/12/2021- Groggy, face/eyes swollen, did not feel well, but not so bad I could not go to work. It was a 50 mile drive, and as I drove the same feeling of not thinking straight did not want to drive. The feeling of being unwell escalated quickly. Congestion, muscle aches throughout, sore throat, chills, and a need to catch my breath caused dizziness. I pulled over, called work, and made my way home where I went directly to bed. My head ached, abdominal (sharp) pains, especially after ingesting fluids. or food similar to gall bladder pain, but not close to its worse intensity still, continues.  2/15/2021- Update- Nearly 96 hrs. passed: What remains is:  Feeling exhausted, need to sleep, more frequent and intensifying abdominal pains, headaches, pain in left lung/easily winded, and site pain expansion. Injection arm (left) pins &amp; needles, and fingers ice cold, neck pain (stiffness).

                                                On February 14, five days after second Covid shot, patient woke up with ulcer in corner of left eye and growing pain in eye itself.  Eye was watering and red and very painful.  Symptoms persisted.  On February 24, patient went to Urgent Care who found ulcerations on cornea and referred to ophthalmologist, Dr., who suspected herpes sores, perhaps due to an immune system reaction to the second Covid shot.  Treated with eye drops (Moxifloxacin, 0.5% 4 times daily), and oral antiviral (Valaclyclovir HCL, 500 mg 2 tablets three times daily).  Eye is MUCH improved, but the ulceration has not entirely disappeared. It is to be hoped that completing the Moxifloxacin and Valclyclavir regimen will completely clear the damage, but there is some concern that there may be permanent scarring. A fourth examination is scheduled for March 10.

                                                Within 12 hours I had extreme fatigue, extreme muscle/body ache, chills, brain fog. This lasted for about 48 hours. After 48 hours the rash started on top on both ankles. That lasted probably 8 days and didn&#39;t get better with cream.  The muscle aches started in my neck and upper body and about 11days ago decided to settle in my knee (right). I though I maybe slipped or fell but didn&#39;t because of the pain. The pain is cross between a  cramping muscle and  shin pain.  I&#39;ve been walking with a limp.  I got in yesterday with my PCP and sending me for an ultrasound to rule out a blood cot. He doesn&#39;t believe it is because it moves, I don&#39;t have any swelling or redness. I have just been really fatigue. I had BP done to make sure my Thyroid is ok and it is.  The past 3 nights it has stopped waking me up at night.   I&#39;ve been doing epsilon salt baths, I can&#39;t put weight on it and still walk with a limp.  I go for ultrasound tomorrow.

Woke up on Saturday 3/6/21 at 8:00AM and the left side of my face and eye was swollen and red rash covered most of cheeks on both sides and well an the entire eyelids on both eyes as well as my far head.  Was very painful and felt like a bad burn. Went to Urgent Care and was prescribed over the counter products and said rash is most likely a related  to Covid Vaccine and to report it to VAERS.  As of 6:45 PM on 3/7/21 as I am filling this out my face is still the same as it was Saturday still red in the same places and still sore.

                                                sharp, unremitting R axillary pain; lymphadenopathy/swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, reporting for herself. A 56-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9269), intramuscularly at the right deltoid on 04Feb2021 12:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was done in a Public Health Department. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. There were no other medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. There were no known drug allergies. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3246), intramuscularly at the right arm on 14Jan2021 14:30 for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Feb2021 22:00, the patient developed sharp, unremitting right axillary pain and lymphadenopathy. She had a normal mammogram earlier this year and no injuries or other reasons to suspect this pain and swelling was due to anything other than a reaction to the 2nd COVID-19 vax. The patient was not worried nor upset, just wanted to pass along this information. No treatment was received. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Also, the injection site became hot and swollen. Day 4, my temperature has gone down but I have a terrible headache, swollen clavicle glands and a chain of swollen nodes (?) from the base of my skull down the back of my neck on the right side. My left arm is still hot and swollen at the injection site. I&#39;ve had to miss two days of work.

                                                About 2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I became very nauseated.  I than begin vomiting.  I vomited probably around 7-8 times (maybe more), and the last 2 times there was nothing left in my stomach to come up and I was just heaving.  I also had moderately severe lower abdomen cramps (just above my pelvic bone).  It felt like my insides were twisting at times, and the pain was constant cramping with moments of pretty severe twisting doubling over pain. I had chills just before the vomiting started, and felt like I had a slight fever, but because of the constant nausea/vomiting I did not take my temperature (all I have is an oral thermometer). To get the pain to stop, I had to lay down on a bed and put pressure on my stomach sides to ease the cramping. I tried taking Pepto-bismol to stop the nausea and vomiting, but immediately vomited that up too. The vomiting finally stopped after 2 times of dry heaving and nothing left to come up.  The severe lower abdomen stomach cramping calmed down around 1 or 2 am. Today I feel weak, my right arm is very sore and slightly swollen, and as of the time of this report at 2:30pm I have only eaten some saltine crackers today. My stomach still feels weak, even though the nausea, cramping, and vomiting have gone away now.

A 56-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 24Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER2613) as a single dose for to prevent COVID (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included having blood clot from 2019 to Mar2021 which the patient stated a couple of weeks ago (Mar2021), she had an ultrascan in her leg and the blood clot was not there, but she is on medication. The patient has recovered completely from blood clot (not ongoing). Concomitant medication included warfarin (WARFARIN) to prevent from having blood clot ongoing since Jun2019. The patient previously took gabapentin for pain but had throat started closing, allergic reaction, coughing and was intubated until she was released from hospital; and albuterol [salbutamol] for dyspnoea but had nebulizer to open up her airways and prevent closing and did not work (drug ineffective). The reporter mentioned that the patient ended up in the ICU because of the COVID vaccine. As soon as the vaccine was administered within seconds, the patient experienced a reaction and was given an epi pen, another epi pen even an epinephrine drip and was sedated and intubated. The reporter mentioned that they gave the patient the first shot of epi pen and it did not work, and she was given a second one and a third one plus steroids. By the time the ambulance people arrived, they hooked the patient up to an IV and gave her additional epinephrine and administered another epinephrine. The ambulance guy told her; she does not need to keep up with them because they needed to go to the hospital ASAP because the patient is not getting better but getting worse. Once the patient got to hospital, she was intubated because her throat was closing. The reporter stated that the patient has allergies to begin with and this was worse than the first time she had to be intubated. The epi pens did not work, the patient was intubated and then had to be sedated. The patient was on Propofol in order to sedate her and later on in the evening was given Fentanyl to relax her then the epinephrine drip was removed at 6 pm on 24Mar2021. The epinephrine drip was started in the emergency room and the patient could not be moved to the intensive care unit until she was somewhat stable. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit and was there overnight and by the time next morning she was able to be extubated where they removed the tube from her around 9:30 to 10:00 25Mar2021. Of course, the patient was taken off Propofol, but she went through a lot and her legs are sore, throat is sore, and is coughing on 25Mar2021 because of the side effects from being intubated and that she went through a lot. The intensive care unit doctor said that the patient can no longer have the vaccine and she would only be 70% protected till whenever they are not sure how long the vaccine will last. The adverse events almost took the patient&#39;s life which made the reporter angry at that. The reporter is not sure what the contents in the vaccine that it in the other drugs and vaccines since there is something that is contained in all of them and the patient was not allowed to have any whether it is the Pfizer or Moderna and it is even up for discussion for even the flu shot because of the reaction and there does not want to be any chances and that everything should be proceeded with caution. The reporter wanted to know what is in the COVID 19 vaccine to see about what could have caused the allergic anaphylactic reaction. The reporter stated and the fact that the epi pen did not work, she was taken aback. The reporter added that the doctor had a hard time intubating because of her throat but they were able to intubate from the second time. The reporter stated that it is taking a while but her wife is recovering and feeling it is taking a while taking a little bit longer. The reporter also stated that they kept the patient in the intensive care unit overnight and after the tube was removed in the morning, by the late afternoon she was moved to a different floor to continue to be observed and the intensive care doctor said 2 days out her wife would be safe to go. The patient stood up but it was hard for her to walk on 25Mar2021 because it could have been from the epi pen, but she is not sure. The patient stated the side effect came out of the allergic reaction and it was on Thursday 25Mar2021. Patient stated the main trouble is her breathing, she is out of breath still and really sore throat on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that the leg sore is still ongoing and is about the same. It was mentioned that the throat sore was still ongoing but some days are worse and some days are better. The patient stated that when she has a problem trying to swallow a tablet and digest it and it gets stuck on Mar2021. It was stated that the cough was not going away. The cough comes and goes away. She will cough for five minutes constantly and then it disappears then she will fall asleep and wake up coughing. It&#39;s as if she is choking (Mar2021). When she is talking, she coughs more. With regards to the allergic anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated she is experiencing the aftereffects of the allergic reaction and being intubated like being out of breath. The patient stated that will come in time and that&#39;s what happens when she gets intubated. Her breathing was heavy and comes back fully with rest on Mar2021. This has taken a lot out of her. She was feeling tired which was still ongoing it is about the same but comes and goes on 25Mar2021. The patient is experiencing lingering side effects and the patient does not feel as if she has recovered completely. It was also mentioned that the patient was intubated on 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021. It was reported that treatment of the patient included Epi Pen, Epinephrine Autoinjector USP 0.3 mg (Epinephrine injection manufacturer was Mylan) which the patient was given at least three injections (two in the right leg and 1 on the left) then received another in the ambulance (unknown site). Patient received an Epinephrine drip and it was like 0.1 mg all the way up until 6 pm (only on 24Mar2021). The epinephrine drip was started when patient was intubated at the hospital. It was given for patient&#39;s allergic reaction through IV. The patient&#39;s lungs were filling up with fluid so her airway was restricting her from breathing and to prevent damage of the lungs that is when the intubation came in. The patient also received Prednisone which the reporter does not recall when this medication was started it may have been after the epinephrine drip was removed but she is not sure if they started the prednisone after or if it was the same evening which the reporter kind of thinks it was. The reporter stated that the patient took Propofol 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 which was given through the patient&#39;s IV and was given to help her airways being intubated, they sedate their patients. The patient also received fentanyl which must have been added either right before Epinephrine drip was removed or after but reporter does not recall. Patient was given Fentanyl 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 through her IV. Patient received this medication to relax because sometimes it is like some patients tend to want to sit up and kind of hear you, hear what people are saying and to relax patient sometimes because they can get scared and not exactly sure what is going on. The events anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary oedema, throat constriction and breathing difficult. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lung was checked from a CT scan was unknown results on 12Jun2019, D dimer test was elevated on an unspecified date, ultrascan in her leg (ultrasound scan) blood clot was not there on Mar2021 and weight was probably weighs 180 or her weight may be a little less like 175 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events anaphylactic reaction and throat constriction were recovering, as for the events leg pain, throat sore, cough and tiredness were not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                I have a very swollen left leg.  It began slowly and became worse.  I thought that I sprained my left knee on  March 13th.  (I had my first vaccine shot in my left arm on March 11th. ) I thought that I would let it heal. My second shot was April 1st and my left leg became very painful after that.  I went to the Doc. for a knee sprain, was sent to Orthopedic. I received an X-ray and an MRI.  There is tricompartmental osteoarthritis, with 2 degenerative meniscus tears.  It occurred to me today that my knee joint may be reacting to the vaccination.  I did have swollen lymph nodes on my left side in neck and under my arm after the second shot.  My knee has had arthritis and  possibly the degenerative meniscus tears but it has never become swollen and inflamed. The swelling and pain has persisted for over 2 weeks now. I?m not sure if it is related but I thought that I should share this with you. If there is anything that you can help with, please do. I have been so very grateful for the vaccination. Thank you!

                                                I just spent 14 hrs in the ER trying to treat, what I was sure to be, an ovarian cyst. The pain had been building over the past mo. I procrastinated going to the ER, because I wanted my 2nd dose b4 going, which was yesterday.    I had exams, pelvic, ultrasounds, Cat scans, labs, etc &amp; they found nothing. I can barely walk without doubling over.  4 wks ago I had an L-5 block &amp; trigger point injections with steroids, due to inflamed nerve roots, &amp; inflamed L thigh. 1 wk later, I had my 1st shot, L arm. Within days my abdomen began hurting mildly, but I thot it&#39;d subside. It never occurred to me that it could be related to the vaccine. 2 wks later, it was unbearable &amp; I thot it an ovarian cyst. I waited for my 2nd shot appt, b4 going to ER, in case I was hospitalized. I didn&#39;t want to ruin my 2nd dose, as I have lung issues.   ER Dr said, I had &#34;undetermined inguinal pain&#34;. Then, I found a study about women, hormonal changes &amp; the vaccine. I saw that lymph nodes can get inflamed after a vaccine.   Now, I think I had a vulnerable area on my L side, then rec&#39;d steroids L side, which lowered my immune system. Next, I rec&#39;d my 1st shot L side, &amp; my &#34;inguinal lymph node&#34; on L side became inflamed. It got progressively worse, &amp; now my 2nd dose was yesterday, also on my L side, &amp; has aggrivated it even more.   Tomorrow I see my pcp.  It feels exactly like my ovary&#39;s swollen, &amp; the inguinal lymph node&#39;s located right in the same place, so after all tests have been negative, I suspect a connection &amp; I&#39;ll discuss with pcp for more testing &amp; treatment.

                                                Angioedema; chest tightness; SOB; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This nurse reported similar events for different doses. This is the second of two reports. A 56-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: ER8734) administered in right arm on 07Apr2021 at 18:00 (at the age of 56-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included prior history of idiopathic angioedema, several other antibiotics allergies - rash, hornet and wasp sting allergies; no chronic health conditions. Patient was not pregnant. No COVID prior vaccination; no COVID tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken at 50 mg for 3 for 12 hours pre-dose; no other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient previously took ZITHROMAX and experienced allergies - anaphylactic; the patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot number: EP7534) on 17Mar2021 at 06:00 pm (at the age of 56-years-old) administered in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced angioedema. The patient experienced angioedema, chest tightness, shortness of breath (SOB); initial reactions started around 12:00 noon on 08Apr2021, slowly continued to get worse throughout the day. Had to go to emergency room (ER) that evening. Angioedema reoccurred the following night and again on 10Apr2021. Another trip to ER on 10Apr2021 due to angioedema, chest tightness and SOB. The events were treatment with BENADRYL, SOLUMEDROL IV, PEPCID IV, nebulizer. The patient had recovered from the events in Apr2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported Angioedema, Chest Tightness and shortness of Breath. Consider also possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate. ,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021330573 same patient, vaccine different dose

This 56-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as &#34;left shoulder&#34;) on 07Apr2021 13:00 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma diagnosed as a child. The patient stated it&#39;s not ongoing, it&#39;s more during seasonal allergies. She took Singulair to help. Concomitant medications were unknown. The patient had Pfizer covid19 vaccine on Wednesday 07Apr2021 and left side face swelling yesterday on 08Apr2021. It&#39;s on the left side of the face. It started around the eye and currently she can feel it running down the side of the face. Left side face swelling was reported as worsened. The patient asked if she would be okay to get the second vaccine. She stated she was not in pain, but was concerned that she won&#39;t be able to get the second vaccine. She had not treated the swelling yet, and was not sure if she should see her doctor. She was scheduled for the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 56-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 18Mar2021 10:30 (at age of 56 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included: Asthma, immune problems, upper respiratory stuff, all ongoing; Her Diagnosed allergies include iodine fish, Propofol, and preservatives, sleep apnea, had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough (Jan2021) from that. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took iodine, propofol and had allergies. Patient took first dose on 18Mar for reason that patient has lost all allergies that cannot be detected by blood work. After first short she was told to wait an extra 15 mins not vitals taken she can leave a felt like a specimen unpaid but paying with life. Patient started coughing while everyone watched her so she said she better take Benadryl cause she doesn&#39;t wanna die. Patient left had off balance couldn&#39;t see straight. She was the one that had all side effects from vaccine as well as COVID signs. She had research medicine/food that cause her to have anaphylaxis. Patient found same ingredients in vaccine but food and drug said it ok. Patient was an experiment. She need to no from your board it is ok for me to take 2nd vaccine. Patient should be getting paid. Her doctor making it seem it up to her she gotta go out and get and epi pen she cant afford. In running out of gloves and mask. The patient experienced Anaphylaxis, has been trapping food since in her throat, headache with numbness, Cough, blurred vision and nausea from headache, all on 18Mar2021. Caller has been coordinating with the CDC by email. Since day one she had a bad reaction to the COVID vaccine. This has been going on a month now. The CDC advised her not to get the second shot. She has went back and forth with the doctor. She had anaphylaxis from the vaccine. Her throat closed. She had irritation in her throat. She has been trapping food since in her throat. This has been since the anaphylactic reaction. She has to chew her food as fine as possible. She tries not to eat that much. This is still the same. It hasn&#39;t improved or worsened. She has also had a headache with numbness that is pretty much 24 hours a day. This started right after. She really felt it the next day. She tried to take Tylenol for four days, three times a day, and nothing happened. It was not going away. Her doctor also put her on a migraine medication, but it didn&#39;t work either. The headache has worsened over time. No medication is helping, and the doctors are confused. The migraine medicine is not helping. Her pressure is going up and down. She is wondering if she needs an emergency echo to see what is going on. She is still having bad effects. No doctor knows what to do. She has been to a lung specialist. Her cough just keeps getting worse. The cough started to get worse after the vaccine. She had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough from that, but the vaccine made it worse. It is a ruff cough. She is on cough suppressant medication. Caller did not have a prescribing doctor. She got it at the hospital. She figured that was the safest, and since she is a patient there they emailed her because she was eligible to get it. She is mostly calling because the doctors don&#39;t know how to help. She is about to pass out from this headache. She is even losing vision from the headache. She feels like she is going to have a heart attack before her time. They are trying to figure out why her head is hurting. They do not think it is a migraine. Her headache is a 9/11 or a 10/12. She feels like after the vaccine she has been chemically off balance. She wants to get her thyroid checked too. Mostly because her food is getting trapped in her throat. Her throat is irritated and hoarse. The headache has given her blurred vision, and a felling like she is going to throw up. She feels off balance from the blurred vision. Caller had difficulty seeing information on Tylenol and Nurtec. She asked her husband to help. They cannot read the lot on the Tylenol. She has been to so many specialists to try to find answers, and no one has a clue. She saw on Pfizer&#39;s paperwork that she needs to reach out to a immunologist. Her allergist had no clue. From the world trade centers falling she has ongoing issues from that. She has sleep apnea, allergies, asthma, etc.  She spent 30 minutes being monitored at the hospital. She had started coughing. Her husband said she needed water. She always carries Benadryl with her. Finally she felt like she needed to take her Benadryl. It saved her. She knows the Benadryl probably won&#39;t work forever, but she cannot afford an epi Pen. Time of Onset (24 hours clock): right after vaccine (18Mar2021). All events require a visit to Physician Office. She didn&#39;t have to go the ER. She was lucky with the Benadryl. She takes Benadryl with her everywhere even to restaurants. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Treatment received for coughing, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache. The outcome of the event has been trapping food since in her throat, had irritation in her throat, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

We gave diphenhydramine 50mg at 2:16 pm. Then at 2:35 pm her symptoms were not improved her blood pressure was 80/40 so we gave one dose of 0.3mg epinephrine by auto-injector and called an ambulance. Post epinephrine her vision improved but her skin was still red and starting  to itch. She was talking and said she was feeling a little better. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital for additional treatment. There was not reaction visible at the injection site it appeared to  be all systemic.

                                                Approximately 4-6 hours post vaccine I experienced site soreness and felt my hands were stiff, felt swollen, especially the right. Within a few more hours my arm became heavy and I had some general muscular achiness. By approximately 11pm I had intense muscular pain on the back of my legs making it difficult to stand. It felt like I had been hit repeatedly with 2x4s. About that time my posterior ribcage hurt also. I couldn&#39;t sleep, turning frequently as my hips hurt. This is what I felt like when I had COVID. Intense pain.  At 0630 (1/14) I got out of bed and felt I was going to faint, was extremely nauseous (I did not vomit) and had a very bad, global headache. I had to lay down again. My temp was 100.1 orally. I could not go to work. I was able to take Tylenol. It helped the pain but two hours later my temp was 100.8. I could not get out of bed  until 6pm, I felt delirious when I tried.  I was able to go to work on 1/15. Of note, following my first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer BioNtech Lot #EH9899 on 12/23/20) I had site soreness, heaviness of my left arm, T of 99.5 same day (about 10-12 hours post vaccination), and mild body aches for about a day.

The affected area has increased in size (about 2.5 x 1 cm now), and the finger is slightly swollen, with pain in the proximal interphalangeal joint when pressure is applied. Two days ago (1/15/2021; 8 days after vaccination), a small pruritic purple papule (2-3 mm) appeared on my ring finger over the distal interphalangeal joint, same hand, and the area is slightly painful when pressure is applied; today, the papule measures 3 x 5 mm. Skin lesions in both fingers are on the dorsal surface. I will seek medical attention.

The patient experienced a warm feeling in her chest like tingling; kind of short of breath, it went away like she said it was just breath it was like for couple of minutes and then it went away and then she was just fine till it&#39;s been long here honestly about 3 or 4 days later; got shot in her right arm but left hand start swelling up first a little bit and then her left arm start swelling up and it&#39;s just and then that&#39;s the base and then her right hand start very, very mild swelling in her right hand. The hospital think there as some clot or something weird but she did not and then that started going down after that it just started going down and went away and never had swelling since then but this was going to long but this was something weird happened to her. She got chills, She got fatigue. She had increased heart rate after that it started getting worse. She had Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, she had that always but it&#39;s been control. She walked 5 miles daily a day, she was in shape, she had lot since then, so it&#39;s been under control, she never had problem with it until after she got the shot, her heart rate was she had to add medication, she never have to add. She took metoprolol (Treatment) so she added that and she added more and that&#39;s thing get it under control and then she take herself back off because she felt like it was under control but she had GI problems since, now she was getting better now, still have some issue, did not feel good, off and on. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: good on 04Jan2021 (blood work to see if something was going on to her heart, because she had short breath, and everything was good), weight: 166 or 164, SARS Covid antibodies test IgM on 04Jan2021: positive. Treatment: Nurse stated, &#34;No, not now, I had a heart-rate monitor, it&#39;s what for see what is my heart rate, to locate and see what&#39;s going on.&#34; Outcome of left hand start swelling up first a little bit and then her left arm start swelling up/ her right hand start very, very mild swelling in her right hand was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event heart rate increased is related to BNT162B2.  The event is most likely due to underlying paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

                                                Received my 1st Pfizer vaccine 1/10/2021. Did great!  Received my  2nd Pfizer vaccine 1/31/2021 1130 am 6 hours later at 6:30 pm ate packaged veggie dumplings and 15 min later my tongue swelled and my face felt swollen and itchy.  Took  Benadryl 25mg, Allegra 180mg and Pepcid 20mg with relief.   6 hours later, awoke  with itchy throat and face  and took Benadryl 25mg with relief.   Next morning, 2/1/2021:  8 am ate  my regular breakfast of peanut butter on toast and 15 minutes later my face started itching. Took Allegra 180mg with relief.  11:30 ate pretzels and face started itching `15 minutes later.   Everything I ate that day caused me to itch 15 min afterwards  just like when I  would have food reactions when first diagnosed with Alpha Gal  and my IGE histamine levels with 3x normal.   I increased my Allegra 180mg to  3x a day for 24 hours and Pepcid 20mg to 2x a day for 24 hours.   48hours after vaccine  I was able to decrease Allegra 180mg  to 2x a day with Pepcid 20mg to 2x a day and was able to eat bland food without itching afterwards.   My allergist felt the 2nd vaccine  may have caused an inflammatory response and flared up my alpha gal symptoms.

Did not take anything for it, as she did not know what to do.  She called her doctor, but they did not address the problem.  When she went to work on 1/12/21 had another lady that is a corporate nurse and told her that it was bad.   Arm is still hurting, and is in the process of recovering.   If she pushes on the location of the vaccine it does hurt.  She has not and will not take the 2nd vaccine.

A 57-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL 3248, Expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 14Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. Medical history includes shrimp allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication was not reported. Historical vaccine includes 1st dose of bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunization on 24Dec2020 09:30 AM, at the left arm, Lot number: EK9231 and Expiration date: Apr2021 at age of 57 years. The patient developed extreme fatigue, some muscle aches on 18Jan2021. She woke up with painful (pins and needle sensation) swollen hands. Took some TYLENOL and elevated them for a few hrs. The swelling subsided by the afternoon. On 19Jan2021, she developed R sided neck and facial swelling with nerve pain. The pain was worse in her R jaw- both upper and lower teeth pain, nerve pain extending from the side of my R ear up to my R eye and temple area. Feeling of heaviness to her R eye, R cheek, R side of her tongue, decreased hearing to her R ear (sounds muffled like being under water), decreased taste on the R side of heer tongue. Took benedryl and tylenol all day. On 20Jan2021, after a restless night due to the nerve pain (not relieved by tylenol) went to work but the swelling worsened so she was sent to the ED. They treated me with IV decadron, IV benedry, IV zofran- which immediately took away the swelling. The events result to Emergency Room/ Urgent Care Visit. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  On 20Jan2021, the patient had Nasal Swab, PCR, covid test result was negative. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter, did not result in death, not life threatening, did not cause/prolonged hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, did not cause congenital anomaly/birth defect. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

Most of the symptoms resolved, but I still have areas of weird sensations that has not gone away. For the immediate treatment, I was given a prescription for steroids and was told I shouldn&#39;t have any additional problems for future vaccinations.    I was scared to get the COVID vaccine thinking I could have another severe reaction, but I was assured it should not happen again.  I had the COVID vaccine on 3/10/21.  Yesterday, 3/24/21, exactly 2 weeks to the day, I&#39;m feeling like the Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms are returning.  I have  had a large fever blister on my mouth and one side of my face is feeling somewhat numb.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 57-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was given the vaccine in a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included diabetes and hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced arm swelling after the injection, then a little later on in the day experienced pain. The next day or so, she got bumps on the left side of the chest. Thought it was shingles and was given medicine for shingles but ended up not being shingles. She still has lumps, some were white and some have busted open, approximately 4. She still had arm pain and back. Arm was still swollen. Went back to doctor on 10Mar2021 and gave another round of antibiotics. Still has a stabbing pain from the from to the back. &#34;1 cm to 1.5 cm.&#34; She had scheduled for a breast screening done. She was still having pain almost 2 months later. The patient provided further information: the patient only got her first dose of the vaccine. Her side effects began that day then gradually got worse. Her left arm was swollen at the injection site since 22Jan2021 and was still swollen at the time of the report. A couple of hours afterwards as the day went on, she had pain in her arm that went to her chest area. The next day (23Jan2021), she broke out with what thought as a nurse was shingles, but was just in one little spot, so she went to the doctor and gave her medicine, antibiotics, and then she took those for 7 days three times a day. The first antibiotic she was on when they thought it was shingles was azithromycin (ZITHROMAX). After then, the pain would not go away and has left scars to her left breast still, that look like white crust on them. She has pain in her left chest still from the middle to her arm down to her elbow. She has two different types of pain, and when she went back to the doctor a day before (10Mar2021), she was given more antibiotics. The pain goes from her front to the back of her shoulder blade and around and was a stabbing pain. Under her arm and going down she feels a pinching sensation that won&#39;t go away, and was all the time. They wouldn&#39;t give her the second vaccine dose while she was on antibiotics that appointment reached its due. The pharmacist came on 05Mar2021 which would be her third appointment to get the vaccine and told the pharmacist her reaction to the COVID shot. The pharmacist asked to look at her injury and then wouldn&#39;t give the vaccine to her. Her doctor gave her some pain medication that would be good for nerves. She can&#39;t take gabapentin and doesn&#39;t like to take pain pills for the nerve pain, so she does paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen every other time to relieve the pain. She says she has been taking paracetamol 500mg extra strength twice a day by mouth, and ibuprofen 400mg twice a day by mouth. She was wondering if there was any information on if her pain would get better since she doesn&#39;t want to stay the same or for it to get worse that what it is. It was a nagging pain that she can&#39;t seem to get rid of and every once in a while she loses her grip with her left hand though not too much and she can grab again what was slipping. The gabapentin for her nerve pain gave her side effects, she was taking 300 mg one pill four times a day. She took about three days worth and starting in Feb2021 she thought. The new antibiotic given on 10Mar2021 that she takes for the bumps on her chest that won&#39;t heal up was cefdinir 300 mg. She says after her vaccine her skin blistered up like shingles centered to her left breast in the middle, which she thought originally would spread all around but it didn&#39;t, it stopped right there. She says that the spots were white and puffy, and some left a bump around in them where they healed up. She says her doctor wanted her to get a mammogram done, which is scheduled for the first Monday in Apr2021. No labs were done, &#34;they just looked at them&#34;. The patient felt bumps on the left side of the chest was medically significant because the scars and bumps have been there a while and several were not healing well. The patient has not recovered from the events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 57-year-old female received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Mar2021 at 08:11 (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergy, asthma (very mild), polyneuropathy from Aug2020 and ongoing, anxiety, and sinusitis. Patient was tested positive for Covid in Jan, she tested positive on 14Jan2021. This was a mild case and antibodies were confirmed afterwards. It was 7 weeks after she tested positive that there were confirmed positive antibodies. Concomitant medications included bupropion (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); gabapentin (MANUFATURER UNKNOWN), guaifenesin, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and Wilson&#39;s Wash (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously took theophylline for asthma and experienced swelling face and pharyngeal swelling. On 06Mar2021, the patient experienced throat felt slightly itchy, left upper forearm pain, pain upper arm. On 09Mar2021, the patient experienced polyneuropathy symptoms were stirred up. On 12Mar2021, the patient experienced full muscular control of my face, at 05:30 she experienced left side of face slightly swollen/left side of face was slightly puffy. On 14Mar202, the patient experienced my gums were slightly inflamed or puffy, particularly the upper gums. It was reported that patient received the 1st dose on 06Mar2021 and Friday on 12Mar2021, when woke up, the left side of face was slightly puffy, face looked normal and had full muscular control of face, but it just went form the jaw all the way to the eyelid only on the left side. On 14Mar2021, gums were slightly inflamed or puffy, particularly the upper gums. Patient called neurologist the next day, 15Mar2021, went to see him on Thursday to have him take a look. He confirmed there was no muscular damage, but the left side of my face when poked was duller than the right side. It started 2 weeks ago today, it hasn&#39;t gotten worse and hasn&#39;t gotten better. Patient was scheduled to get 2nd dose this Sunday but going to hold off because she was concerned about this side effect. Patient tried using Claritin and Benadryl to see if that might make it go away, but it didn&#39;t. Her face does not look disfigured in any way. It&#39;s not getting worse or better. Just staying the same. She also has polyneuropathy. She got it in Aug2020 from a needle biopsy of the lymph node in her left breast. It was supposed to decrease over time over one or two years. Prior to having Covid she didn&#39;t think about it most days. When she got Covid it stirred up the symptoms. When she got the vaccine it also stirred up the polyneuropathy symptoms. She started to notice it being stirred up 09Mar2021. Her neurologist said it was her immune system working and it was aggravating it. On 12Mar2021, she had the left face thing, which was completely new, she never had symptoms like that. It has been 2 weeks and hasn&#39;t gotten worse, hasn&#39;t gotten better. She was super healthy. She doesn&#39;t drink, doesn&#39;t smoke, and exercises every day. On the needle biopsy last year by the radiologist in Aug2020. She got small fiber polyneuropathy, which causes tingling prickly sensations in different parts of the body. It was acute form and will go away in a year or two. By Jan it had minimized, but Covid stirred up the symptoms. The neurologist said any illness can cause polyneuropathy symptoms to increase. Then they started to subside. When she got the vaccine, by that Tuesday the polyneuropathy symptoms were greatly aggravated, by the 09. She was confident that they would resolve and have lessen in severity. The clinical outcomes of the left side of face slightly swollen, throat felt slightly itchy was not resolved, for the throat felt slightly itchy, left upper forearm pain was resolved on 06Mar2021, for the pain upper arm was resolved on 07Mar2021 and for event Polyneuropathy symptoms were stirred outcome was resolving.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information was expected.

She wanted to take the second vaccine, just doesn&#39;t want to have a stroke or heart attack or anything like that.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EW0150; expiry: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Mar2021 01:30 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was a warehouse. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and no following prior vaccinations. Medical history included covid-19 in Nov2020. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 on 31Mar2021 and 12 hours later (on 01Apr2021), sore arm, fever, chills and headache. Got a swollen lymph node in armpit, same arm as injection left side, today tip of left ring finger turned white and numb. She thinks it was Reynauds phenomenon. The patient called and told nurse in her doctor&#39;s office and they said if it was painful, it could be a pain clot. It was painful at first, that lymph node started 24 hours later with a sharp pain, and then she just assumed it could be a lymph node. Swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and it was very sore. The nurse told the patient to call Pfizer. The patient was fine until the tip of her finger happened. The patient said If it was painful it could be a blood clot, would need an x ray and asked if did the shot cause this. The complete ring finger left hand, the patient looked it up and it said it could happen to her feet and she looked, and her feet were modeled red, blue it was bizarre. Never happened before. The patient was not happy about getting the vaccine, she already had covid in November of last year (2020). The patient wouldn&#39;t have called if it wasn&#39;t for her finger. Not just her feet, her hands got like this too. The patient didn&#39;t want to get the second shot. The patient asked if there was any information or mandate on timing information for the second dose, should she needed to postpone it. The patient asked if what was the efficacy after first dose as she felt like she was immune because she had the virus and now the vaccine. She was very hesitant to get the Covid 19 vaccine. She thinks her body created Covid 19 antibodies. A couple days ago she was very sick. The swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and could be a blood clot as far as she knows (in 2021). Even putting on deodorant she can tell it&#39;s there, it was very sore and there&#39;s a lump. Today (on 01Apr2021), she noticed the tip of her finger got white it was numb. She looked it up online and she thinks it was Reynaud&#39;s phenomenon. She has a picture if Pfizer needed it. The finger was on the same arm that she received her vaccine in. It was the ring finger on left hand. Once it started happening her finger felt funny and felt numb. She put her finger under warm water. She reported that the white color was maybe a third of the way down towards her knuckle. She was asking if this was normal or has this been reported. She had called her doctor today and spoke with the nurse who told her to call the CDC and report her symptoms. She needed her glasses trying to give her primary care doctor&#39;s phone number. The patient wanted to add that she has something like gout in her foot and on that side too, the left foot, it was pulsing and throbbing all night. She&#39;s had this pain in her left foot, she thinks its gout because it was all the symptoms of gout and she had it for a while, it hurts off and on but that night it was hurting and throbbing. She has not been diagnosed with gout in that left foot. She still has a headache but today she felt good except for her finger turning white and going numb. The lymph node in her armpit hurts. Her doctor&#39;s nurse told her if its painful to the touch it could be a blood clot so she was nervous about that. The tip of her finger was completely white and the rest of her hands were blue and red and white and yellow. She reported that her finger was back to normal now. She didn&#39;t want to get too inoculated since she also had the Covid 19 virus. The events did not require visit to emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events was unknown for thrombosis, Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon, erythema, cyanosis, illness, visual impairment, and gout while for the remaining events was recovering.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Mar2021 the patient experienced a significant drop in her platelet level and on unspecified dates the patient experienced swelling at the injection site, her arm was the size of an egg and it was hard and she was tired for 24 hours. The patient stated that she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 25Mar2021 and she then had routine blood work done on 27Mar2021 (also reported as 29Mar2021) which showed a significant drop in her platelet level. She stated that she normally had a platelet count on the lower side, but the platelets were quite a bit lower than the last bloodwork she had done. She stated that she had blood work last on 24Mar2021 which is why she knew. She stated that her platelets dropped after she got the first dose. She checked the internet for side effects of the vaccine and she did see that some people had reported that a lowered platelet count could happen. She stated that she was doing research to investigate if this was truly a side effect of the vaccine. She wanted to know if this had been reported before. She would like to know before she got the second vaccine. The patient also stated that she also had swelling at the injection site, her arm was the size of an egg and it was hard, and she was tired for 24 hours. The patient wanted to know if she would still need to wear a mask after having received both doses if she decided to go out in public or visit others and she wanted to know how effective the first dose was if she decided not to receive the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the events a significant drop in her platelet level, swelling at the injection site, her arm was the size of an egg and it was hard and she was tired for 24 hours were all unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Apr2021 at 16:30 (lot number reported as &#34;EN or W 0161, EN0161 or EW0161&#34;) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetic from 2008, blood clots , COVID-19 (reported as April; year unknown), insulin dependent in 2014 , Protein S deficiency, genetic disorder that makes her have blood clots, neuropathy. Concomitant medications included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN) taken for Protein S deficiency, genetic disorder that makes her have blood clots from 2007 to an unspecified stop date; gabapentin taken for neuropathy from Sep2019. Patient stated that she gets a mild case of the flu when she gets the flu vaccine, but she doesn&#39;t remember back to childhood. She got an MMR booster about 20 years ago and had no problems then. Family Medical History: both parents had diabetes; mother has Protein S deficiency as well that causes blood clots. The vaccine was administered at healthcare facility. The patient did receive previous immunization with a Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination.  The patient received her first shot on Monday 12Apr2021 and was fine until 12 hours later. Her arm swelled up and she couldn&#39;t lift it. Then the swelling went to the back, the shoulder blade up the left side of her neck. She could feel her lymph nodes and so she was icing it, taking Tylenol and the swelling has gone down. The redness was gone but she still has arthritic type pain in left arm socket. She can lift and move the left arm, but it hurts, and it also hurts when she turns her head to the right. She received the Pfizer COVID vaccine in her left arm. The pain started at injection site and then went from her elbow to shoulder and then up her shoulder and up to the neck. Her family was commenting on her neck being swollen. She received her shot at 4:30 PM on 12Apr2021. The redness and swelling started at around 5:00 AM on 13Apr2021. A couple hours after Pfizer COVID vaccine injection the pain started. She waited for 30 minutes because she takes coumadin for a history of blood clots, nurse wanted to wait to make sure her arm wouldn&#39;t bleed. She has been taking Benadryl ointment and icing it for 3 days as treatment for the events. She got up at two this morning to go to the bathroom and noticed she could still feel the pain when she turns her head to the right. She had swollen submandibular lymph nodes and could feel two of them before. When she woke up, she could not feel her lymph nodes. Everything has recovered except for the pain. The patient stated that on the first day the symptoms were disabling, and she couldn&#39;t lift her left arm at all. They got better once she started icing it and rested instead of doing chores. She keeps popping Tylenol every 6 hours, Benadryl and refilling ice bag with one ice bag on neck and one ice bag on arm. There was a deep ache right now in the socket that goes up her neck and down the shoulder blade to her back. Right now, she doesn&#39;t like to be in any pain and would say the pain was mild compared to how it was, the pain was so bad she was rocking and crying. Her brother gave her one of her mother&#39;s pain pills, one Vicodin because she was in so much pain. She can control the pain now with the extra strength Tylenol. She got the Pfizer COVID vaccine for lots of reasons. She has a lot of health problems, she had COVID virus last April and that was why she was having this reaction since she already has antibodies. She takes care of her mother who was sicker than she was. She was out in the real world and she doesn&#39;t want to bring anything home or get anything herself. She thought gabapentin would have made it to where she did not have the arthritic pain from vaccine. She takes gabapentin for neuropathy. She was diabetic and that may have something to do with it too. Patient stated that everyone else in her family got Johnson and Johnson and nobody had reactions. She was supposed to get at the Johnson and Johnson shot first but with the shortage it was switched over the to Pfizer COVID vaccine. This was her first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Redness and swelling started at around 5:00 AM 13Apr2021. Pain started around 6:30 PM. The events did not require emergency room visit or hospitalization. She was at the urgent care yesterday where she gets her INR checked and the nurse said she didn&#39;t see any swelling but believed she was in pain because the she didn&#39;t want to lift the left arm. The reporter assessed the events swelling, redness, and pain were considered serious (disabling). Outcome of the events vaccination site pain, neck pain, arthralgia, and back pain was recovering, for event crying was unknown, for event swollen submandibular lymph nodes was recovered on unspecified date, while for events swelling, joint swelling and redness was recovered on 16Apr2021.

                                                Hands turned red with slight swelling. Face and chest with red blotches.  Nausea and pounding heart rate. This is the same symptoms I experience if I drink alcohol.   I drank water and it got better in an hour.  At night, my scalp was itching all nite.  My scalp was red on the right side only which was the site of the vaccine.  It is now 2 days later; the itching is gone but scalp has red blotches although they have faded at lot.

(No symptoms at all with first immunization) Symptoms of fatigue began approx. 12 hrs. late,  then fever after midnight, chills, body aches, severe headache, abd cramping, and extreme fatigue. Highest fever recorded was 101.8 the next day (Sunday) around  4pm.  Didn&#39;t take Tylenol or Motrin.  As of writing this (Monday 12:07 pm) my fever is gone but headache and extreme fatigue remain. Injection site still sore and today I notice I have a very swollen and painful lymph node left axilla opposite injection site.  I had to call in sick today and possible will tomorrow if the extreme fatigue and headache don&#39;t go away.

Tylenol was taken, which offered very little relief. 1/8/2021; I awoke with extreme fatigue, unable to sit up,  nausea, and diarrhea with stomach pain, headache, which wasn&#39;t unrelieved by 1000mgs of Tylenol, unable to raise R arm due to swelling and pain, aching and weakness all over body, joints, and muscles. It also caused a Fibromyalgia flare-up, which I wasn&#39;t experiencing prior to vaccine. It was 1/10/2021 before I was starting to feel better.

A 58-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Batch/lot number: EL0140), in Hospital, by intramuscular route in right upper arm on 23Dec2020 at 08:30, at 58-year-old of age, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She didn&#39;t receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that it has been 2 weeks since she received the COVID-19 Vaccine now and she still has a considerable amount of lymph node swelling and lymphedema in the right forearm side and the right upper arm. The nodes on the right side of her neck around the clavicle have been quite swollen for about 2 weeks. She has the list of side effects so she was not concerned, as this was listed but now she&#39;s not sure. When she got the vaccine she had the expected redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site (onset reported as 23Dec2020). On the evening of the 24Dec2020 she had an itchy scalp but she didn&#39;t see any rash and that only lasted a short time. On 29Dec2020 the patient had a significant swelling on the right side of the base of her neck near her clavicles that wrapped around to the posterior of her neck and was assessed as medically significant. She treated it by putting ice on it in the evening. On 30Dec2020 the swelling seemed to be slightly decreased but it is still a visible lump, the nodes are firm and there is swelling around those and it has not improved since the 30Dec2020. On 30Dec2020 she noticed a little cold blister or hive on the center of her lower lip and that was resolved by 03Jan2021, she did not have fever and did not feel sick, but her main problem is the swollen lymph nodes around base of neck around clavicle and it is considerably swollen there. The patient reported that last night (06Jan2021) it looked like her right arm was swollen, she thinks she is having lymphedema on the right arm, her right forearm is half an inch circumference larger than her left arm and was measured at her work. The patient reported she is seeing her new primary care doctor on 26Jan2021 and will follow up with the doctor. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose scheduled for the next week or should wait until the swelling resolves. Moreover the patient asked how long do the side effects usually last (specifically systemic side effects). The events &#34;redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site&#34; and &#34;slightly itchy scalp&#34; resolved on 25Dec2020, the event &#34;Cold blister on lip&#34; resolved on 03Jan2021. The event &#34;Swelling on the right side of the base of her neck near her clavicles&#34; had not resolved yet at the time of the report.

A little later on I felt like something was on my neck so I reached up felt some swelling on  my lower neck and shoulder. Before reaching back to work my face felt like it was swelling only on the left side. As the day went by the workers at my school could tell that my face was swelling. Got home called the hospital and the told me to go to the ER. I went and they checked me out and put me on prednisone and benadryl.  Second day I still feel like my face feels numb and still have to swelling at the bottom of my neck.

                                                Post-Vaccination Paresthesia course:  About Sunday, 1/17/2021, I began to feel a numbing sensation spreading on the top of my head.  Since I was recovering from a severe allergic reaction to the Covid vaccine (numb, swollen lips, face, tongue), I initially thought it may be a recurrence.  However, by the morning of Tuesday, 1/19/2021, the numbness was complete from the tops of my eyebrows, over my scalp, my ears and down the center of my back to my buttocks. The numbness was bilateral. Alarmed, I went to the Emergency Room.  (I am a hospital pharmacist there.) The ER consulted Neurologist.  After MRI results, diagnosis was Post-Vaccination Paresthesia.  I was released from work by the ER through 1/21/2021.  The height of the paresthesia was 1/21/2021.  This included some auditory buzzing and mild blurred vision.  Today, 1/22/2021, I am beginning to regain feeling on my back and forehead. I estimate that I have regained about 50% feeling on my scalp.

                                                Pt. developed itching of her upper palate almost immediately after the vaccine, transiently dizzy but that resolved quickly . Over the next few minutes she also developed erythroderma of bilateral forearms and hands, slight swelling of hands, reddened palms.  We assessed her vital signs below, kept her in observation over the next 40 minutes. She denied difficulty breathing, she questioned if her voice was different, but was not detectable to 2 observors. Lungs remained clear, no stridor, no capillary refill delay. Gradually symptoms improved, erythroderma and hand swelling resolved over about 15 minutes. Pt. then noted possible tongue swelling, on the sides at 25 minutes post vaccine but again, no difficulty with breathing or swallowing. Vital signs continued to improve, pt. then stated itching was gone and tongue felt better so she was released and advised to return to E.R. in event of change. Pt. is a phyician.

It is still present now, 10 days after receiving the vaccination.  I saw my MD today who assured me it is a typical appearance for a lymphadenopathy, but it still bothers me, especially never having had such an occurrence before.

I initially did not contribute this to the Covid vaccine but thought I was having complications from my surgery.  However, I had not had any adverse reactions from my surgery and I had been going to follow up visits weekly with the surgeon.  I went to the ER  on 1/24/21 because I had gained 13 lbs. in fluid over a 3 day period and thought it could be a DVT or CHF.

I was asked by my PCP to wait 2-3weeks to see if they subside and if not she will order a new ultra sound(which I am waiting to hear back from her)

                                                Everything was good the first day. The next morning, I had severe chills that lasted about 6 hours. During that time, I started getting a temp, the highest was 103.3. I called my doctor and she seemed convinced that it was something else because she hadn&#39;t seen that reaction before. I then had developed a headache. The fever took several days to go away. My doctor (via phone) told me to take Tylenol.  I also had tingling in my right hand, extreme fatigue, joint stiffness and swollen lymph nodes, which remained swollen for at least a week. I was in bed for over 24 hours. It eventually started it get better after a few days. I also had an antibodies test before I got the vaccine and two days later I found out I had positive antibodies--and this was 6 months later (I had COVID in July). I had the same reaction with Dose 2.

                                                After a few days past the first dose, I noticed a pain on the left side of my chest near my armpit.  Through palpation my primary care dr noticed a large swelling which was very painful when she pressed down on it.  She sent me for a diagnostic mammogram which was completed with no issue noted by the radiologist.   The technician mentioned that the vaccine has caused lymph node swelling in some women.  After about 1.5 more weeks the pain went away.

I experienced minor lower lip swelling at 9:30 PM (the lower lip, left side only).  Went to bed approx. 10:30 PM and experienced mild chills.  I woke up at ~3:30 AM with full facial swelling (forehead, brow, eyes, under eyes, facial lines, jowls and full lower lip only - now right side engaged and more pronounced than the left side) and mild full body hives.   I took a Zyrtec.  The itching of hives subsided in approx. 30 minutes.  The facial swelling and lower lip swelling subsided in approx. 12-hours.  I took and have photos of my face and lips.

Very painful accompanied it.  The day after that the lymph nodes in my left collarbone area became swollen and painful with an increased fever, chills, headache that lasted for a week.  I got the vaccine on a Thursday (3/4/21) and went to my doctor on Monday (3/8/21) to get checked out.  This was only my first vaccine.  I had a bad case of Covid-19 in June-July 2020 and my husband passed from Covid-19 at that time.  I still have swelling in my left collarbone lymph nodes today.

A 58-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EN9899) intramuscularly in the left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraine from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications (&#34;other medications in two weeks&#34;) were reported as none. The patient previously received epinephrine on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced drug allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 31Dec2020 at 06:00 the patient experienced swollen fingers, joint started hurting, cannot hold fine item and my both hand fingers were drum sticks painful/fingers hurting, I am cutting and dropping things more frequently. The events all resulted in doctor visits and were all serious for disability or permanent damage. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;I developed swollen fingers, joint started hurting. My both hand fingers were drum sticks painful (as reported). I had no idea what was going on, things getting my ankle knees (as reported). I consulted internal medicine; I was referred to Rheumatology Clinic. All blood work was negative. All serology testing done was negative. Joints hurting. The doctor asked me to start taking Motrin which made my situation worse. I gave up. Miserable situation. I consulted another FPC who advised I give it time. I cannot hold fine item. Fingers hurting, I am cutting and dropping things more frequently. I am a healthy person. No medication. No complications.&#34; The patient asked if there were any solutions. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EN9231) intramuscularly in the left arm on 15Jan2021 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received treatment for the adverse events which included Ibuprofen 400mg for pain. The clinical outcomes of the events swollen fingers, joint started hurting, cannot hold fine item and my both hand fingers were drum sticks painful/fingers hurting, I am cutting and dropping things more frequently were all not recovered/not resolved. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                allergic reaction to the first dose; Felt like her throat was constricting; Very flustered while driving home, somehow missed her exit; face is swollen; fast heartbeat; heart racing really fast; This is a spontaneous repot from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199), intramuscular in the muscle of upper left arm (deltoid left) on 03Mar2021 17:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a pharmacy, not a facility. No other vaccines were administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included hormone replacement therapy, high blood pressure, and &#34;very sick she guessed from a cold and had asthma&#34; on 2011 (from 10 years prior to the report; this was the only time she had asthma, and her physician said her asthma can come on because of being sick). The patient stated that she generally has higher blood pressure than she would like, but she is otherwise very healthy, and never had an allergic reaction to anything. Family history relevant to the adverse events was none. Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) for high blood pressure, valacyclovir (VALACYCLOVIR), rosuvastatin (ROSUVASTATIN), omega-3 nos (OMEGA-3 NOS, capsule), estrogen (ESTROGEN) for Hormone replacement therapy, progesterone (PROGESTERONE, 100 mg capsule) for Hormone replacement therapy, all were from unspecified date and ongoing. It was reported that patient gets her flu shot every year and never had an adverse reaction. The patient reported that she had an allergic reaction to the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE she received last Wednesday (03Mar2021) after an hour after she received it (18:45) while driving. She mentioned that she saw on the package insert what a severe allergic reaction would include. She experienced swelling of the face and a fast heartbeat but no difficulty of breathing on 03Mar2021. The patient further explained that she had her first dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE on 03Mar2021 around 17:15 at a pharmacy. She left the pharmacy around 17:30. While she was driving home, she started to feel her heart racing really fast and felt like her throat was constricting within about 30 minutes of being administered the vaccine, by around 17:45. She was very flustered while driving home which is usually about 30 minute drive; but somehow she missed her exit and it was rush hour so it was about 18:15 when she got home. When she got home her husband asked her if she had been crying because he said her face looked weird. She told him he thinks her face is swollen. All of these events lasted maybe 1-2 more hours or less after she got home around 18:15, maybe a few hours before she recovered completely. She was expecting soreness and pain from the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE but was not expecting the fast heartrate or swelling. She was reading through the information she got from the pharmacy for the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE because she was a little concerned about getting the second dose due to these events. She has never had an allergic reaction to anything before and wondered if she should go to a hospital for her second dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE in case she has these events again, or a worse reaction. She asked about these events and dosing recommendations for the Pfizer. The reported adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the events was recovered on 03Mar2021.

Nine days after the vaccine I got Bells Palsy and I have not been able to work since then. I noticed when I gargled that night the water was coming out. The following day was a holiday and everything was closed. I was able to see my doctor. My left eye was not closing and I had difficulty eating because the left side of my face was effected. I had to tape my eye shut at night.  It is very sad and upsetting because I don&#39;t know if it will get better. I have seen a Neurologist. It has been four months and I am still getting therapy for the Bells Palsy.  Physical therapy since 04/19/2021 with electrical stimulation. My eye closes a little better and my smile is a little straighter.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0615 am on 1/8/21.  Had no symptoms (not even injection site pain). At 2100 on 1/8, began to develop a lot of pain at the injection site.  Within 2 hrs of that time, I developed other symptoms, which include total body (bone and joint) pain (especially in my knees), and what I would describe as a &#34;bad sunburn type&#34; rash across my cheek bones, bridge of my nose, and orbital area.  Small raised bumps to this area, with swelling, and a feeling of pins and needles stabbing me all across my face.  My airway was fine, and at no time did I feel shortness of breath.  I was unable to sleep due to the bone and joint pain, and felt the need to walk continually (it was more painful to stay in one position). These symptoms persisted throughout the day (Saturday 1/9/21), noting at 5pm I described myself &#34;miserable&#34; to my friends and family.  All symptoms described above,  were at their most elevated intensity between the hours of 1700 - 0400. At 0400 Sunday (1/10/21) I felt a gradual release of the body aches, enough so that I could sleep until 0800.  At this time, 1300 (Sunday 1/10)  I note that I still feel &#34;flu type&#34; body aches, but constant pain has diminished in intensity by estimated 50%.  The sunburn type redness and swelling across my face/orbital area has also less by 50% (there is still redness, mild swelling, warmth, and some raised bumps across this area;  pins and needles feeling is gone).

A 59-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:15 at first single dose (0.3 cc, but really uncertain of dose) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID virus from Nov2020 to 2020 (The patient was not hospitalized. It was a mild case and lasted about 10 days. she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines at the same time or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccinations in past or events.  Caller reported she had the first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on the 30Dec2020 and having some side effect symptoms and her supervisor recommended for her to report these things, they are not life threatening, obviously, but things were still lingering. Side effect of severe fatigue started on the 31Dec2020 and lasted for 72 hours. It was so severe, now it is mild. The patient reported soreness around the injection site. Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3 and had that for 6 hours then it dissipated and was gone. Had never had a fever after injections before. Had severe arm pain that usually goes along with an injection. It started also that night of 31Dec2020. She had rolled over in the middle of the night and it hurt. That lasted for about 48 hours, but it has improved. Had some muscle aches since 31Dec2020 but that had improved and had joint pains since 31Dec2020. What was worrisome was the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes, since 31Dec2020. The patient was still having that and that is why she was so concerned because shouldn&#39;t that have gone away after a week. Had knee and hip joint pain, but that had improved. Again, mentioned she had never had that before with an injection. The patient received vaccine at her workplace. Some of her coworkers got it the same day and no one else has this. Mentioned she did have COVID virus back in Nov2020 and wonders if this correlates with her getting the vaccine. Was not hospitalized or notified she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue. This is the same way she felt back when she had the virus back in November. The patient was concerned about having these side effects would it be okay for her to get the next injection in 3 weeks. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No further details provided. Outcome of the events Fever was recovered, of event swollen and painful lymph nodes was not recovered, of events knees and hip joint pain, fatigue, muscle pain, severe arm pain was recovering, of event soreness around the injection site was unknown.  The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, severe arm pain, muscle ache, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient had the tiredness, mouth sores or something like that in Jan2021. When patient look at her cheek, the gum inside cheek have white spots on it and it looked red and swollen and it hurt, especially the left side and that bothered patient because patient cannot really eat and it hurt. It was more of the cheek inside the mouth, that&#39;s painful. It&#39;s not open sore but it&#39;s just red and like tender. And also patient had a tenderness of lymph nodes on the left neck. For causality, the patient thought so because nothing has changed since before patient got the vaccine. Patient didn&#39;t have any of this, especially the sore in the mouth. Patient cannot eat on the left side because it hurt. But the rest of the symptoms which was the tiredness and the swelling of the lymph node, lymph node was kind of tender but it&#39;s only on the left side, that&#39;s listed as the side effects. But the sores in the mouth was not listed that&#39;s why patient was worried about that. Lab work: results were okay. The tiredness, it was like patient got it in the morning, so patient slept. Patient went straight after work, then patient slept. When patient started getting ready for work and the alarm went off, patient was extra tired so I called out sick, but patient was okay. For treatment, patient took naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and then, because patient was at work and yesterday it was really bothering patient because it was hurting. It started hurting really more when the evening was on. Then patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL), then the nystatin solution, patient tried to swish and it helped a little bit with the pain. Due date for the next dose was 08Feb2021. Outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                I began to feel ill on that Wednesday morning. I had had a bilateral mastectomy in Nov of 2020, and tissue expanders are still in place. I reached a fever of 103.6 and had pain and extreme redness in my right tissue expander. I also had all axillary lymph nodes removed from that side in December 2020. On Friday I was still feeling ill and noticed redness, so I immediately contacted my doctor and was instructed to meet him at the hospital. I was admitted and placed on antibiotics and had my tissue expander removed The next morning after no improvement from antibiotic infusion. I had a wound vac placed and stayed in the hospital for one week and had my expander replaced on that following Saturday.  I am not planning on taking the second shot.

                                                9 hours after injection, injection site started to swell significantly. after putting a cool towel and then trying to put covered ice pack,  started having significant joint and muscle and scar tissue pain in hands knee and feet and hip. Then bicep muscles tensed up in both arms and then relaxed several times, as well as pain in collarbone and tightness up neck as well as swelling of face and top lip. I did not know if I was going to have a stroke and if I needed to go to an emergency room but the symptoms subsided. Some diarrhea next day. I understand from my therapist that multiple people have reported the significant muscle issues and it is not printed anywhere as a side effect which would help.

                                                Woke on the morning after the shot 2/27/21 with a low grade fever (100), fatigue, headache, joint and muscle pain and slightly swollen lymph nodes in my neck.  Within a few hours, my body was completely covered in large hives from head to toe.  I rested or slept most of the day and by the afternoon, the fever had subsided.  By the next day headache, joint/muscle pain and swollen lymph nodes diminished.  I still felt fatigue and the hives were awful.   Began taking Benadryl with no relief.  Called my primary care doctor to report; increased Benadryl dosage to 2 every 4 hours.  There was some relief during the day, but the large doses of benadryl were making me anxious/nervous, racing heart, shakes.   Decreased following another call to Doctor and began taking Antronex; decreaed side effects, but little affect on the hives during the evening/overnight hours.  At times I would be completely covered in them, other times they were localized (bottoms of my feet, face, neck, eyes).   Returned call to Doctor, again suggested Prednisone. (I typically have strong reactions to steriods and wanted to avoid if at all possible) Began first dose 3/18/2021.  Experiencing some relief already.

A 59-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 59) as a single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included an unspecified heart condition and a flu shot un an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;ERGOCALCIFEROL;NICOTINAMIDE;RETINOL;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE). The patient stated, &#34;I am calling about the side effects I had from my Covid shot vaccine. I am concerned about getting the second one because my reaction was so big. I got it on Saturday, this past Saturday about 12:45 I think 12:30 and I did fine, the shot didn&#39;t hurt at all. That night I was a little bit tired but that&#39;s it. My arm was just little bit sore. The next day I got up, I still felt good I went to work for 2 hours and then about 12 o&#39;clock it hit me all at once. This Sunday I ran anywhere from a 103 to 104.6 fever and that was me taking Tylenol and I took Tylenol every 4 hour because my fever was still high. The glands in my neck and the glands under my arm on the side where I got the shot swelled up, they are still swollen. My whole body ached. I had Covid fairly bad I got pneumonia with it all for &#34;two weeks&#34; (not clarified) but my fever was not as high as got with the shot, the vaccine like I could barely walk after the vaccine because my joints were so stiff only way I could walk was to shuffle my feet, it was horrible. I had a fever yesterday all day but it was only in the 102.3 and 4, it never went back to 103. Glands in my arm and my neck hurt quite badly. My arm where I got it, it wasn&#39;t swollen but I get the same reaction when I get a Flu shot (unspecified shot) so that&#39;s not a big deal. I got horrible headaches. I had diarrhea all day Sunday and yesterday and so this morning my fever is only right around 101 like 101.1, 101.2, I am still super tired and also yesterday and day before I was dizzy and foggy. I still have a slight fever today. My lymph nodes are still swollen, my neck and under my arm, my arm where I got the shot is still swollen and sore but I can tolerate that. My joints are stiff a little bit but not nearly as bad as they were, so I don&#39;t know if I should get the second shot, everyone says the second shot is worst like all those heart palpitations start with it as well.&#34; One of my other symptom is at night I break out into a horrible sweat like I have to change my pajamas twice. It was last night and the night before. I am like really wet.&#34;  The outcome of the events was not reported.

                                                Within a few hours of shot, I experienced EXTREME tinnitus (very loud), numbness in head, face and lips and hardening of lymph gland in left chest. This lasted for hours. Injection site pain only lasted about 24 hours.  Since then, I still have numbness on the right side top of head and intermittent EXTREME  tinnitus that interferes with my ability to concentrate, communicate and sleep. It comes and goes but the volume is beyond anything I have ever experienced. Then it goes away. The  right side of my head has stayed numb.   Will this go away? Should I get the 2nd dose or not?

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 22Feb2021 11:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9266) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included arrhythmia, ear infection. Concomitant medication(s) included propranolol (PROPANOLOL [PROPRANOLOL]) taken for arrhythmia from Apr2020 to an unspecified stop date.  The patient previously took augmentin [amoxicillin;clavulanic acid] for ear pain and experienced rash on her elbows and palm and arm. Caller stated on Friday 05Mar2021, which was the 11th day after getting the Pfizer COVID Vaccine although she noticed symptoms on the 10th day 04Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine, states she noticed she had a hive rash on her palm and hand and elbows/rash on her palms, hands, elbows, and left hip and it was strange and her elbows were red and were itchy on the palms like red and itchy and she could see the rash starting on the left inside forearm; from there as the day wore on into the next day the rash became worse and more areas of the body were covered with the rash. States she made an appointment on that Monday morning with her HCP and had gone into the HCP office at that time; states on 08Mar2021, she was in distress with her throat starting to swell, her tongue started to swell/ her lips and tongue began to swell and she was covered with the hives and rash from head to toe. Caller states she was started on Prednisone at her HCP office and it was one of those dose packs; states she has no lot numbers to provide. Later on that evening she needed to go to the emergency room and she had become more severe and had a big dose of Prednisone at the emergency room and at that time the HCP there did believe she was having what is considered a post COVID vaccine delayed allergic reaction and hives; states she was in the emergency room early and was there past midnight and thinks she presented to the emergency room on 09Mar2021 and then most recent results she has of her paperwork were from 09Mar2021 to 10Mar2021; no further details provided by the caller. Caller states she was in the emergency room rolled over to the next day on the 09Mar in the evening around 10:30pm and concluded her ER visit on the 10Mar after 12:30. Caller states the HCP gave her the 40mg dose of Prednisone by injection and she has no lot number; states then at the ER, they gave her Prednisone 125mg IV and she has no lot number; they gave her hydroxyzine which is Atarax by IV and gave her Pepcid for her stomach at the same time; no lots for the Pepcid or Hydroxyzine. States the reason for her visit was allergic reaction, allergy hives, post covid delayed reaction. States she let them know at the site that before the vaccine she felt like she might have had an ear infection and was not taking anything no vitamins or anything like that and no Tylenol or anything for a week or so prior because she wanted nothing to be in her system other than the vaccine should anything happen. Had the vaccine that day, later on that afternoon contacted her HCP felt like she had ear infection, no fever but had fullness and some pain in her right ear. Saw her HCP at that time and took a look inside her ear and felt that she did have an ear infection without fever but was painful to the touch around her ear underneath her ear; prescribed Augmentin which she has taken before. Started taking one Augmentin pill on the 23rd in evening which would be Tues 23Feb2021 for the 1st dose, 500mg and dose supposed to take following the next day was to take two tablets one tablet twice per day which she did finish up around 10 days of that on 04Mar. The day before all this started with the rash she finished Augmentin, went to the HCP and two things happened; she was taking Augmentin and had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. States she had the rash on her elbows and palm and arm and she was like that coincides with the Pfizer vaccine but also was on Augmentin and had been on that before with no problems; thought it was either the vaccine or being on the Augmentin as the reason for the rash but narrowed it to the vaccine. States she ended up in the hospital that evening on Monday evening of 09Mar and it was something they had not seen but were prepared to see could happen and concluded the rash was from the vaccine. Caller states she went to see her immunologist at the conclusion of this event and she was still covered in hives and rash and did step her down on the Prednisone and prescribed her hydroxyzine and topical itch stuff. Caller states she has no lot numbers to provide for the topical stuff or the hydroxyzine or Prednisone. States the HCP concluded she could not receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine or any other vaccine that comes forward and she is not a candidate because of this reaction he can&#39;t safely say it would be ok to get a 2nd dose of the vaccine; states she can&#39;t receive a 2nd dose of any covid vaccine and it worried her because she has to be ok with having had the 1st dose of the vaccine and wants to know where she stands with that and what to do and she just doesn&#39;t know. States it is not she herself saying she can&#39;t get the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine but under her HCP advice and two ER visits and many doses of Prednisone and she presented how she looked and that prompted the HCP to say no 2nd dose for her. States she was taking Prednisone started two days of 50mg then 2 days of 40mg, then 30mg, then 20mg, then 10mg and that brought down the amount in her system; states she was given Hydroxyzine 1-2 tablets every 4 hours of 25mg and has no lot numbers for the Prednisone or Hydroxyzine. Caller states instead of taking Benadryl she was taking the topical stuff because Benadryl was not really working and she took Benadryl 25mg tablets in the beginning to try to get the itching out of her system and she felt really really tired and was so tired from taking the Benadryl; caller states she has no lot numbers to provide for the Benadryl. She was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine and the thinks it tended to work better and she did not take a drastic amount of it but it could cause drowsiness and she did feel a lot better from taking it but did not have a really bad feeling of feeling really dopey and sleepy with it because she felt bad enough and did not want to feel bad. States she kept on this for the 10 days or more of a 14 day course and was feeling like until it started to subside. On an unspecified date it was reported that Her WBC count was high and her &#34;liver was not doing great&#34; but recent bloodwork shows it has returned to normal. The patient was hospitalized for the events developed hives/rash on her palms, hands, elbows, and left hip, elbows were red, hive rash on her palm and hand and elbows and it was strange and her elbows were red and were itchy on the palms like red and itchy, her lips and tongue began to swell, WBC count was high, liver was not doing great, post COVID vaccine delayed allergic reaction. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included white blood cell count: returned to normal on an unspecified date, white blood cell count: high on Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events except for WBC count high and liver was not doing great. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 16:00 (Lot Number: EN5318, Expiry date: 31May2021) on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. Historical Vaccine included flu shots. The patient stated her physician told her she had an acute lymphatic response. She added there was something about 3 am (18Mar2021) because she woke up at 3 am and had severe pain in some of her lymph nodes. In particular, the ones around her ovaries. She added that she was old and her ovaries had not worked in a long time. She had severe pain like cysts except both sides were hurting. She also had trouble catching breath with the pain. This lasted 45 minutes and subsided. The next morning 18Mar2021, when she got up some of her lymph nodes were very panful and there was one even that was a node visible down her throat almost at the base of her neck in the center. She could see it sticking out, it was crazy. It went down in about three days. The pain and the weirdness in all of her other lymph&#39;s was about 3 or 4 days. It was an odd response and people told her it was just her body acting like a young person and was going to work. This was the first issue she had with the vaccines. The patient also experienced brain fog after first vaccine on 17Mar2021: within 2 or 3 minutes of having them her head started feeling foggy and weird. It was after the first vaccine, she thought it was psychological but it did not go away and it was not psychological. It was like a weird foggy and like taking sinus medication, no additional details. When it happened with the first vaccine, it did not concern her as much as the first one. It went away after the first vaccine probably late that evening (17Mar2021), around 10:30 pm right when her arm started to hurt. She did not have arm pain that was severe. She added maybe it lasted a day. The next day it hurt but it was not anything bad, it just hurt to touch it and to lift it hurt for a day. Maybe this was for 36-40 hours before the pain went out. The outcome of event &#34;trouble catching breath with the pain&#34; was resolved on 18Mar2021 03:45, outcome of event &#34;brain fog/head started feeling foggy and weird&#34; was resolved on 17Mar2021, outcome of other events were resolved in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Mouth broke out; zit that broke out on the top of her eyebrow. There are hard little bumps; they were red and hard; Arm was sore; puffy/swollen; She had a breakout on her face, a couple of lesions, and her mouth broke out.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to Penicillin, crustaceans, shellfish, and mushrooms. Those were what she usually had a breakout for. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug allergy and second degree burns. Her reaction to amoxicillin was probably 15 years before. The patient had a reaction to her first Covid-19 shot. She took the first shot last Tuesday. She had a breakout on her face, a couple of lesions, and her mouth broke out. It looked like a reaction. She took a couple of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), and it was going away. Her second shot was scheduled for next Tuesday 11May2021. She needed to know if there was anything in the shot that would cause this. She was leery of taking it. She was okay with it, and the diphenhydramine hydrochloride was fine. She did contact her doctor. That was it, she had nothing else just the breakout. She thought it was maybe Thursday 22Apr2021 or Friday 23Apr2021 that she noticed the breakout on her face. She started trying to take some diphenhydramine hydrochloride. It was rapid when it happened, not slow. She saw these as almost like a reaction. She had welting on the skin similar to a reaction to dust mites. There was this thing she thought was just a zit that broke out on the top of her eyebrow. There were hard little bumps. One had gone away, and the other was still there. It was almost like when she had a breakout of zits was kind of what she would say. It was dissipating. She started taking rounds of diphenhydramine hydrochloride to stop the reaction, and it was working. She was concerned about the second shot. She didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction to amoxicillin or any other type of medicine if it was in there. That was what she was concerned about. Before she got the second shot she needed an idea of what might have happened. The lesions came a day or so after the breakout on her face. She would say Sunday 25Apr2021 was when she saw the lesions above her eyebrows. It was right at the beginning of her eyebrow. It was really hard at first. It was not itching, just like zits. Similarly, they were red and hard. Once again she started the diphenhydramine hydrochloride and saw a little bit of difference, but had to keep putting on topical Aquaphor and cocoa butter. She had to keep putting it on there, it was just swollen. The lesions were puffy and red. There was just one left, it was going down. Her mouth was the number one thing. She thought it was from wearing a mask. She had never had a breakout with a mask before. She took the shot on Tuesday, and her arm was sore just for 24 hours. She noticed her mouth broke out Thursday or Friday for sure when she woke up. At first she just kind of forgot about the shot and didn&#39;t put two and two together. She took diphenhydramine hydrochloride. It was the same type of reaction she would have if it was amoxicillin. She really needed to know if she should anticipate something with the second shot. Outcome of event a breakout on her face, a couple of lesions, and her mouth broke out was resolving, and of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.
