                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

                                                My daughter experienced on day of her 2nd vaccine, feel nauseated in the evening time, then the second day. Felt very lethargic, fatigue, laying in bed all day, sleeping. She still had nausea also experienced chills, highest temp 99.8F. Her arm pit on the right side where she got the vaccine was really sore. She basically like within a couple of days she started her period cycle again and it was very heavy and lasted one week and half almost two weeks. On 06-08-2021, at about 10pm, she was brushing her teeth when she saw black spots and she went to tell me. At about 11:30pm that night, she squatted to pat our dog and when she got up and she felt really dizzy, lightheaded so I got concerned. Her symptoms persisted and I scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician on 06-15-2021. The pediatrician ruled out anemia. Her pediatrician said she has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Her pediatrician said that this is something manageable, she needs to strengthen her calf muscles and drink lots of water. They monitored her heart pressure and blood pressure.  Her heart rate had increased to 40bpm.  I also gave her Ibuprofen medication after the vaccine. Leading to today she has been having dizziness and light headiness every single day. My daughter is still  experiencing  symptoms, dizzy and light headed today.   For her 1st vaccine- within few days after her 1st dose, she experienced when using the treadmill, she would feel very dizzy. I did not think anything of it at first and this happened three times then it stopped. She also had a sore arm.

She said she has her menstrual cycle and it has never been this bad. She said she didn&#39;t get it last month at all. Prior to this, she said her cycles were normal. She also had pain in her thighs and trouble breathing which resulted in her needing her rescue inhaler.  At this time she has been given ibuprofen and is resting with a heating pad. I as pts. mom am concerned that this may be related to vaccine.

She&#39;s recovering perfectly as usual.  She has them occasionally (every few months) but normallly driven by her menstrual cycle which is not coming up and made this uncommon. I just wanted to report it so you have the information.   It could be in the birth defect category below, but I&#39;m not a doctor so not sure and selected none of the above.

Her bleeding became VERY heavy after receiving the shot, where she was bleeding through super plus and ultra tampons in just a couple of hours.  She is still bleeding like this 6 days later.  It has not stopped.  Her regular periods are quite lite and nothing like this.

                                                Pt reports she had her first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 5/17/21. The following week she had a very heavy period that lasted longer than usual with severe cramps and occasional lightheaded/dizzy spells. After her cycle ended, she continued having  brief episodes of dizziness, usually when going from sitting to standing, usually resolved quickly (after a few minutes) with rest. Over the past two weeks, the episodes have become more frequent and intense, and over the past few days episodes also include s/s of seeing spots and having blurred vision with nausea, SOB, and palpitations/tachycardia. Tonight while at lacrosse practice, pt suddenly became dizzy and felt like she might pass out, became diaphoretic and pale.

This 15-year-old female (non-pregnant) patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (lot#EW0196) on 30May2021 11:00 AM, vaccine location=Left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was Asthma. No any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), paracetamol (TYLENOL) as needed. It was 4 days early and was the worse period she has experienced in 3 years. She was bleeding excessively and extreme cramps on 02Jun2021. We thought maybe it was a coincidence. She is only 15 yrs old and has had her period for 3 years and has never experienced anything like what she has in the last month. She is due for her next period on 29Jun2021 and I pray it was not as bad as last month after the shot. Outcome of reaction/event at the time of last observation was unknown. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow up attempts needed. No further information is expected.

This involved increasingly heavy bleeding, with large blood clots. My daughter became very pale, weak on the morning of Mon, June 28, she fainted, then vomited. Made dr appt and got bloodwork. Started her on iron supplements. Dr said the hemoglobin was at 10.6, but had us get blood checked 3 more times, lowest hemoglobin was at 7.3.
