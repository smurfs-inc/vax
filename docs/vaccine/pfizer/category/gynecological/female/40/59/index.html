All symptoms but the rash improved the following day. I went to have my 8 week pregnancy US 6 days after this second vaccine dose and there was no fetal heart rate.

                                                Starting within 6-8 hours of the vaccinations, I began some menstrual spotting. This has been ongoing lightly for the two days following the vaccination. Initially it was just a tiny bit of pinkish discharge noticed after using the bathroom, but now its is more of a very light menstrual flow. It should be another two weeks before my cycle returns, so this is way off schedule. I cannot think if anything else that has changed and would cause this.

If my cycle was a country, it would be Germany because my internal trains run on time without fail. However, the morning of 3-23-21, my period started. It is so out of the ordinary and I have become aware that I&#39;m not the only woman with this issue after receiving the vaccine.

                                                My first dose was 1/14. I found out I was pregnant on 1/26/21 and I miscarried at about 10 weeks. About 15 mins after I got the vaccine, I had a racing heartrate and my palms were hot, but it went away. Around 3pm, I had a right frontal headache. I took a nap and it went away. About 5am Fri, I woke up to severe arm pain and it felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach. I took about 400mg of Ibuprofen, went to sleep and was fine when I woke up. About 5pm Friday, I began having vaginal bleeding. I called my doctor and was able to get in on Feb 11th. At my OB/GYN appointment, they tested my blood and urine, which confirmed my pregnancy. The NP examined me and told me that the bleeding was coming from my cervix, so they sent me for an ultrasound the following week. That&#39;s when I was given my calculated date of 10 weeks. A gestational sac was observed, but they weren&#39;t sure if a fetus was present. I had to see my doctor every week since I was still bleeding and that continued until March 18th, when I lost the pregnancy completely. I took my specimen to the doctor the following day. They told me that they were sending it out to be tested, but I&#39;m not sure if the results are back. They did confirm that it was a fetus.

Flow was unusually heavy and very clotted - all abnormal for me. While I may have felt some fatigue from the shot, I never felt ill in any way.  I also never felt any of the points of pain I might feel with my normal period, such as sore breasts prior to my period and cramps in my upper legs when it arrived.  I only had a sore arm for a day where I received the shot.

                                                Significant pain in both shoulders and neck. Bilateral shoulder pain has lasted for 3.5 weeks despite only receiving vaccine in left arm, both times.  Pain feels arthritic in nature and has made it hard to function. After the first shot, I got my period early and after the second shot, I have not had my period/missed a period (I have never missed a period before in my life except when pregnant 6 years ago).  Also had left breast swelling that lasted around 1 week after the second shot.

My toddler still nurses 2-4 times daily)  the day after my shot I had started menstration very suddenly and very heavily.  I was so surprised by the volume, I use a menstrual cup with a 1 ounce volume and over the course of six (a normal period for me is 3 ) days I measured 9 ounces of flow.  This period was sudden, twice as long and twice as heavy as usual.

There were several bouts of bloodwork perfomed which were normal until the miscarrage occurred and all ultrasounds were normal until the 3rd which showed the miscarriage.

Miscarriage discovered 4/5/2021 and suspected to have occurred around 3/20/2021 (baby measured 7weeks,1 day on ultrasound).  There were no indications of miscarriage before the ultrasound 4/5/201.  Neither me, the  patient, nor my doctor believe the miscarriage was a result of the vaccine but as it occurred a few weeks after I received the second dose in the series I felt it should be reported.   I was approximately 4 weeks pregnant at the time of my second dose.

I think it is important for you to look into what about the vaccine could trigger women&#39;s periods to change.

                                                At approximately 6pm on 4/16/21, I began feeling as if I were in a fog (second dose of COVID-19 vaccine received at 10:30am previous day).  I began to feel weak and tired; all I wanted to do was lay down.  I laid in bed and took my temperature via ear.  100.8 in the right ear and a reading of 101.2 in the left ear (I&#39;ve not had a fever since maybe 12 years of age).  I was also experiencing a headache (back of head) and neck discomfort.  I felt hot, specifically ears and face.  I took 400mg of ibuprofen at approximately 7pm and 1000mg of acetaminophen at approximately 10pm.  by 10:30 my temp was 98.9.  I woke up at 1:30am on 4/17/21 and was completely drenched I sweat.  I assumed this was from the fever break but I woke up again at approximately 4am drenched again.  After waking and getting up around 8am on 4/17/21, I felt great; back to normal.  I went about my day.  I woke again around 1:30am on 4/18/21 with a sore neck and the back, lower area of the head hurting (this wasn&#39;t the same feeling as having a stiff neck or laying in an awkward position).  When I sat up, I felt some sore, throbbing on the top of my head which then subsided.  I woke again at 4:30am with the same issue.  I was also, again, completely drenched in sweat but no fever this time that I am aware of.  My pajamas were soaked.  I felt some relief with the head and neck discomfort when I got up at 6;30am.  As I type this now, my head and neck feel basically normal.  I also wish to report that in addition to injection site soreness which I think is always to be expected, I have been experiencing quite a bit of soreness and discomfort under my left arm.  It runs down my left side from my arm pit to the side of my left breast.  This area has been sore and tender since the evening of the day I received the shot (4/15/21).  I&#39;m assuming this could be due to stolen lymph nodes which I was told by a health care professional, could be a side effect of the vaccine.

The cramping and clotting is always over by day 3, and this time it was still continuing on day 4. There was enough clotting and blood loss that I was concerned for my health. On day 4, I was seeing 4-6 clots every time I changed my pad.

                                                I am a breastfeeding mother. I almost exclusively pump and bottle feed. I have not had a menstrual cycle since my child was born in October because of this. 72 hours after getting this vaccine, I started bleeding heavily. I am also not producing as much milk as I was before the vaccination. Prior to the vaccine I was pumping a total of 6 ounces every 4 hours. After the vaccine I have been pumping about 4 ounces every 4 hours. I have not had any change in my eating or drinking habits that would account for this loss of milk output. I also had a headache and sore arm but that was to be expected. These two issues have since resolved. The bleeding and loss of milk production are ongoing.

                                                After first vaccination, my period came a week early which is does not happen at all.  With in a couple hours after my second shot, what was a light period became very heavy.  The period continued every day at varying levels from spotting to heavy for exactly 6 weeks with only a handful of days (3-5) with no bleeding during that time.   At times it was so heavy it leaked in my bed and on my couch which is abnormal.  There were several days that were heavy and also contained a lot of clumps/clots.

I bled for 16 days straight with no let up, went through two boxes of super plus tampons and a bag of extra long pads (I normally bleed for 5-6 days with only one heavy day, use a mix of super and regular tampons, about 15-20 total). I passed large blood clots almost every day of this long period (never happened for me before).

A 40-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 28Dec2020 10:00 (lot number and expiration date were not reported) as single dose (at the age of 40-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated in a hospital. The patient had no medical history and no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no other vaccines in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. On 01Jan2021 at 6 pm, the patient experienced cervical radiculopathy, muscle spasms, neurological pain down right arm, bursitis right elbow, menstrual changes - ovarian cyst and carpal tunnel. The adverse events resulted in a doctor/healthcare professional clinic visit and was considered a disability/permanent damage. The patient received treatment of &#34;PT, Mobic, soma, ultram and trigger point injection. The patient has not recovered from the events. The patient had a negative nasal swab test on 16Jan2021. The patient received the second dose administered in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (lot number and expiration date were not reported) at a single dose.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events cervical radiculopathy, muscle spasms, neurological pain down right arm, bursitis right elbow, menstrual changes, ovarian cyst and carpal tunnel most likely represent intercurrent medical conditions that are assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The evening of the vaccine I started getting sore ovaries, which continued for about 3 days, waking me up that first night with the pain. It felt like they were hot and aching, like they were working very hard, something I haven&#39;t experienced before. This was 5 days after my last period finished. I had spotting the next day, which I never have, and then my breasts became very sore, lumpy and tender for the next week or more - very concerning as I have had a fibroadenoma before. Symptoms were similar to being pregnant, but I have just started my next period, and did a pregnancy test which came back negative. I have also had ongoing light tinnitus, which started a few days after the vaccine. Again, I haven&#39;t had this  before, and it has been almost 3 weeks now and it is still at the same intensity. I am very worried about getting the second vaccine next week.

The patient previously received the first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732), administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 11:00 AM (at the age of 40-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient&#39;s period became heavy 8 hours after the shot (15Apr2021 08:00 PM) and she passed several golf ball size blood clots. The clots and heavy bleeding subsided by 6am. This has never happened to her before in her life so it was most likely vaccine related. She contacted her PCP who told her to see her OBGYN ASAP. She was waiting for her OBGYN to call her back. The patient did not received any treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered. The patient did not covid-19 tested post vaccination.

                                                I experienced a miscarriage in February 2021 and did not menstruate after that (though my normal cycle was 21-28 days). I started menstruating unexpectedly 2 days after my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. I would think it might be a coincidence except I&#39;ve heard from a lot of other women that their cycles were affected by the vaccine. So I thought I&#39;d offer the feedback. I believe the vaccine may have triggered early menstruation for me. Additionally I believe I may have passed remaining pregnancy tissue during this unexpected menstruation.

My period, always regular, came 2 days early and was heavier than usual with greater pain.  Since then, I have not gotten another period but I have had extreme mood swings, period of uncontrollable crying (not linked to any other event in my life), intense fibroid pain, constant hormonal acne, new cold sores popping up almost every morning and constant recurring yeast infections.   Nothing was or is different about my health, lifestyle, medications or any other factor other than the vaccine.

                                                Menstrual period delayed by 8 days. Heavy PMS symptoms including breast tenderness, irritability, headache, cramping and bloating lasting for 10 days accompanied by a heavier than usual menstrual period but lasting a shorter amount of time than typically experienced previously (typical period is about 5-6 days long, this period was only 4 days in duration).  Worth noting the reason I was hyper aware that my period was late is 1) it has never been late in my entire life and I am 41 years old. 2) I use an app to track my cycle and it kept alerting me that it was late. I am on birth control and knew that I was not pregnant, however, it caused distress because I didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me and no one wants to have severe PMS for 10 days with no relief in sight.

                                                3 days after getting 1 dose of Pfizer vaccine I started I had pain in my left arm and was losing feeling from the injection site into my fingers--tingly feeling.  Joint pain in both hands--this subsided about 10 days afterwards.  13 days afterwards, my abdomen swelled--normal waist is 27--went up to 30/31 inches.  15 days afterwards (today) ankles swollen and tingly in both feet but the left worse than the right.  Period is also 10 days late as of today--I was regular before the vaccine.

                                                Symptoms are ongoing 8&#43; weeks post vaccine. I have had two doctors visits and numerous blood tests.  All normal.  I was perfectly healthy prior to this other than a vitamin D deficiency that is now within the normal range.  No known prior COVID exposure/infection.  Have been maintaining a small, strict family bubble since March 2020 - working from home, home schooling my son, no travel or even going into stores.  I had the normal/expected next day reaction to the 2nd shot - extreme fatigue, body aches, headache.  I rested for the full day on Saturday and felt better /normal by Sunday morning.  However, by late Sunday afternoon, new symptoms came on.  They started out on the left side of my body and then grew from there in the days that followed.  First it was pain behind my left knee that radiated down to my ankle and later upward through my left thigh, hip, entire arm, and shoulder.  From there, it progressed to all over pain in my joints on both side of my body and almost daily headaches - typically around the base of my skull.  I am also experiencing prolonged periods (days and sometime weeks at a time) of constant muscle tension/soreness in both arms and legs and intermittent tightness in my chest.  However, the pain has remained most intense/pronounced/persistent on my left side and a couple of different times in the last 8 weeks I&#39;ve had bruising on my left foot and ankle.  As a result of all of this, I am fatigued most days and it is all inhibiting my ability to function normally.  I don&#39;t know whether it is related to the vaccine or not, but I know it isn&#39;t normal.  My quality of life and ability to function as I typically have has decreased dramatically in the last 8 weeks and I am very worried and I don&#39;t know what to do.  If someone can please contact me and advise whether they have received any similar reports and provided direction on some type of specialist or test that might be able to help, I would be forever grateful as I am scared and my primary care physician has basically just said I need to wait it out.

After vaccine on April 23, 2021, symptoms started in May and June 2-3 days prior to the arrival of my period consisting of very heavy cramps. Cramps then subsided after 1 day until the day of my period&#39;s arrival. On the day of period arrival, my period was very heavy (not usual at all for me) and the cramps had to be treated with 4 tablets of 200mg ibuprofen tablets which dulled the pain,but did not remove it prior to my period and during my period.

It seems that both getting Covid in my last menstrual cycle AND getting the vaccines during my current menstrual cycle  have caused really long cycles for me.  My cycle is typically about 30 days long and quite regular.   However, during my last cycle I had contracted Covid and the cycle length ended up being about 41 days.  And my current cycle is on day 56 and counting.  I just thought this was interesting to note, since my cycles are usually quite regular, and the only thing I can think of that has been different for me THIS cycle is that I got 2 Covid shots. I have had a tubal ligation, so it is highly unlikely that pregnancy is the reason for this unusually long menstrual cycle.  Just thought this was interesting to note and important to report.  Thanks!

After my vaccine my cycle came every 2 weeks for 2 Months.  Light flow for the 2 Months.  I seem to be back to the 21 days currently, but my flow is heavier.  I even got a test to see if I was pre-menopausal and it came back normal. As there was no other change to my medication the covid vaccine is the only thing that I can link to this change.

I have been in close contact with my PCP and OBGYN regarding these reoccurring headaches. The first headache started 2/1/2021 and lasted 6 days and nothing (Excedrin, Advil, Tylenol, muscle relaxer &amp; even tried a massage) but nothing  helped. This seemed to correspond with  menstrual spotting that is why I have been working with both my PCP &amp; OBGYN.  We have not been able to narrow it down to what is causing it and since it started soon after my vaccine I thought I should notify someone incase others are having the same issue.

I&#39;ve had 3 periods since my second vaccine, and I am still experiencing menstrual changes- very painful cramping prior to actually getting my period.  This is uncommon.  I usually have slight cramps after bleeding for a short period of time, but the last 3 periods I&#39;ve gotten really painful cramping before.  The cramps start about 3 days before, and have continued for at least 2 days once I&#39;ve started my period.

On day 9/10 following the vaccine, I woke up with severe pain in the same arm at the injection point and pain with mobility of the same shoulder. Later the same day I unexpectedly began my menstrual cycle. It was 7 days early. It&#39;s never early, ever. My cycle is down to the day and regular, always. No usual menstrual cycle indicators/symptoms prior to it beginning either. The day after my cycle started, I noticed my heartbeat was pounding very loudly at night in bed, this lasted for 3 days with moments of minor chest tightness in the center of the chest, which was concerning, I almost opted to go to ER. this sensation subsided on the 4th day and has not returned.

                                                Following the second vaccine dose, I had two highly unusual periods that were marked by 2 days of heavy bleeding. The bleeding was so heavy I soaked through 6-8 pads during a 5 hour time frame.  The bleeding also contained huge clots often the size of a golf ball or larger. This has happened on 6/4/21-6/6/21 and 7/2/21-7/4/21.  I recently went to my  provider on 6/25/21 for a gynecology exam and received normal results for cervica.

                                                My period has been regular for years and light for my entire life. I was due to start my menstrual cycle on April 1 but I had a severe reaction to dose 2 of the COVID vaccine and was sick for several days so I didn&#39;t think much of it when I missed that cycle completely. Then on May 1st bleeding started and was extremely heavy. After 6 weeks I went to my women&#39;s health clinic and they ruled out other serious causes with an ultrasound scan and a biopsy. Via ultrasound they confirmed that my uterine lining was very thick, which makes sense with the inflammatory nature of this vaccine (activating immune system, etc.). I have been able to stop the bleeding by taking LoLoestrin, though it comes back quickly, even mid-month if I miss one day of the pill. I am finishing the second pill pack and after the third I will return to the women&#39;s health clinic for a follow up.

                                                Within an hour of receving the vaccine, I became dizzy, had face tingling and arm tingling and felt mentally foggy.  As the day progressed, I felt a fullness in my throat and fatigue.  Over the next week, the dizziness became worse, I experienced intense headaches and shortness of breath for several days. I had difficulty sleeping and vivid dreams.  I have had thyroiditis twice in my life after giving birth to my 2 children with similar dizziness and throat fullness.  I decided to contact my doctors and had my thyroid levels checked.  My TSH was abnormal and my doctor thinks I could be having another episode of thyroiditis.  My menstrual cycle arrived a week early.  Following this, I continued to have dizziness, throat fullness, and intense headaches.  I developed sore breasts and breast discharge as well as in increase in frequency of urination.  I decided to postpone the second shot until I was feeling better as past episodes of thryoiditis took about 2 months to resolve.  My next menstrual period was a week late, also accompanied by mood swings, breast tenderness and intense headaches.  SIx weeks later, I continue to experience occasional dizziness and throat fullness and increased urination.  Prior to the vaccine, I was feeling fine and it seems like the vaccine triggered some kind of hormone/endocrine response in my body.  I have not had reactions to any vaccines prior to this.  I am quite hesitant to receive the second vaccine and am wondering if I should wait a period of time and try something  different such as the Johnson and Johnson one.  I? not quite sure what in the Pfizer vaccine ( perhaps the mRNA?) could have triggered this reaction in my thyroid and endocrine system. and would appreciate guidance on what to do next as I would like to be fully protected from COVID-19 but do not want to endure these unusual side effects.

                                                After my first vaccine, I started to have breakthrough bleeding, having my menstrual cycle every two weeks, first one lasting eight days straight.  I went to se my gynecologist who performed an Ultrasound but could not find anything wrong. Since my first vaccine, my menstrual cycle has been out of sync. I am actually starting a week and a half earlier for my menstrual cycle and this really concerns me since I am planning for embryo in the future.

This has happened six days in a row since the vaccine. If it continues I am going to try Tylenol instead.  Also, before my period starts, I usually lightly spot for two days.  After my injection, I started an extremely heavy period without any warning.  This is not typical for me.

Since I am on birth control pills, my periods have always been regular for past 15 years. Also I noticed the period is heavier than normal and also has large chunk of blood tissues/pieces. Other than that, I am completely fine and normal. I also didn&#39;t have any of the listed side effect of the vaccine such as soreness, headache,  tiredness etc.

                                                Menorrhagia. I had a 5-day-long period that started 3/6, 2 days after my second dose of Pfizer. Then another 10-day long period started 3/19, meaning the menstrual cycle starting 3/6 was only 13 days long. I&#39;m seeing a reproductive endocrinologist for infertility and he mentioned that a few of his patients had also seen irregular cycles after the second dose, so that&#39;s why I thought to report it here. While irregular menstrual cycles may not be a big deal to many women, I&#39;m pursuing infertility treatment at the age of 41 and don&#39;t have time to mess up my cycles.

It was 7 days early and I am *never* early?my cycle has been 28-30 days like clockwork since I started menstruating in 1993. My flow has been much heavier and I have had a lot of large clots which is very unusual for me.

After 10 hours of administration, I started vomiting throughout that night until the next morning I vomited 7 times. At 11 hours after administration I began with involuntary movements, to shake a lot. It gave me a fever of 40 degrees. The next day I couldn&#39;t get up. Body pain, I got dizzy from just walking, and I couldn&#39;t urinate, I had pain in the ovaries and pelvis area. That day that was the next, I continued vomiting and I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I was given a saline solution for dehydration, and I took phenergan 50mg for vomiting. 36 hours later my hips and back and legs ached. At 48 hours I started diarrhea which to this day I continue with them (5 days after the vaccine). After 5 days of the vaccination I continue with diarrhea, I have controlled them with imodium and probiotics, I have a weak body, I get dizzy at times, and I continue with pain in the ovaries like menstruation that at the moment is not supposed to be because I was menstruating just 3 days before the vaccination. My body feels strange, my hips, back and head still hurt, and I continue with stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. Medications were administered at home.

A 41-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 15Apr2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW1058) as 2nd dose, single or covid-19 immunisation. The first dose was received on 15Mar2021 17:00 (lot number: ENLe208). The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications were none. No other vaccine was administered in 4 weeks. Six days after receiving the 2nd shot of the Covid vaccine from Pfizer, patient conceived on 21Apr2021. After 4 weeks and 4 days of pregnancy, patient had a miscarriage on 08May2021 14:30. While a miscarriage can happen at the early stages of pregnancy, this stage was exactly when the placenta was forming and patient was wondering that the rumors about the COVID vaccine rejecting the protein of the placenta were correct. No treatment was given. Outcome of the event was not recovered. Patient did not have covid prior to vaccination and had not been tested post-vaccination.

                                                My arm hurt for 1-2 days. The first day was pretty extreme muscle pain and I felt slightly tired. The unusual thing was I had 10 days of heavy cervical mucus discharge.  I have never had anything like this, but especially not at 41 years old.  After that, my period started 10 days late.   My period is very normal and predictable usually.  These two events were not normal for me.

This time my flow was moderate  progressing to heavy compared to my normal flow and it lasted 11 days. This had never happened to me. I did not have any additional stressors, life changing events or health issues that would affect my cycle. I don?t use any form of oral contraceptives. I did experience a headache for two days mid cycle but it?s not uncommon for me to have a headache sometimes during menses. I took Advil 200mg for it one time.

I started bleeding on 4/8/21 and went to the emergency room where they saw an embryo with a slow heartbeat.  The bleeding continued and I went to see Dr. on Friday 4/9/21 and an ultrasound was performed where an embryo was seen with a slow heartbeat.  The bleeding increased and I went back to the ER on Saturday, where they took my HCG and it had not doubled.   It went up by a few points only.  By Sunday, I was bleeding heavily and cramping.  Monday, I went back to my OBGYN where they conducted an ultrasound to determine that I had miscarried.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A 41-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 16Apr2021 at the age of 41-years-old (Lot Number: ER8731) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concurrent conditions was none. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced Known allergies: Amoxicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported: &#34;I broke out in a rash on 17Apr2021. It started on my face in a straight line down my left cheek and neck. Then it appeared in patches on my trunk (both stomach and back). It eventually spread to my legs. I got new patches for 2 weeks following the shot. I went to the doctor and they couldn&#39;t prescribe steroids as it was stated that it would lesson the effects of the second shot. When I started my menstrual cycle 3 weeks following the 1st dose of my Pfizer shot I had severe cramping and clotting for 3 days during my period. It was the most pain that I have had from a period. The flow was stronger from the beginning of the cycle than is typical.&#34; The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovered in 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known safety profile of the product, there is a reasonable possibility that th event rash is related to BNT162B2.

                                                After the 1st shot, I had the usual sore arm and swelling. In the next few days, there was a large amount of swelling on the right side. Pain at the injection site, lymph swelling. It stayed pretty constant and I did my best to move my arm and use ice to combat the pain. For my second shot, I was still experiencing pain on the right side so I asked to have it in the left. I reacted with the typical low-grade fever and aches. I had some slight swelling on the left side but it went away in about 24 hours. Within that week the right side axillary area swelled up and pain got worse. My breast became very swollen too.

                                                The lymph nodes behind both of my ears became so swollen and painful to the touch that I couldn?t wear my eyeglasses for a week.  After that went away, my spleen became tender and sore for approximately three days.  Since getting the vaccine, I have episodes of dizziness and feel lightheaded frequently (a couple times per day).  My periods were almost non-existent prior to the vaccine and now they?re very heavy and last a week or longer.

                                                After the first vaccination shot (late April 2021), my menstrual cycle was fourteen days early. After the second vaccination shot, my menstrual cycle was later than usual, arriving at about Day 31 of my cycle. My cycle is typically 26 days long. The menstruation after my second shot was exceedingly heavy and painful - I had terrible cramps, worse than normal fatigue, and very heavy bleeding. The menstruation lasted longer than normal for me (about eight days), and it was followed by a few days of spotting, which is also unusual for me. In addition to these changes in my cycle, I experienced worse than normal migraines throughout the month of June, both during menstruation and during ovulation. I typically get migraines about once or twice a month, and I was getting migraines about 3-4 times a week throughout June.

After 2nd shot, same as above has persisted. HOWEVER, I have not menstruated ! I had typical period pains, felt like I was going to start on schedule, but I have not to date. All typical menstral pains are now gone.  Date of last cycle began normal on 6/5/21, lasted 4 days.

A 42-year-old female patient, not pregnant, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6198) via an unspecified route of administration administered on the left arm, on 23Feb2021 09:45, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included breakthrough bleeding at times through years. There were no known allergies. Concomitant medication included hydromorphone hydrochloride (DILAUDID) and, alprazolam (XANAX) - both taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported. Also as reported concomitant medications included &#34;oxymoron&#34; and &#34;flexibility&#34;. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient stated it was weird because she experienced a breakthrough bleeding period-wise 12 days after shot, on 07Mar2021 11:00. She stated this has happened through years and; a bunch of women on (social site name) were discussing it and majority had a breakthrough bleeding 1-2 weeks after shot and; that they will also be reporting. The patient stated she has no idea if this was a true side effect, but she considered it strange that so many experienced it too. She also experienced normal sore arm and extreme fatigue - both on 07Mar2021 11:00. Her next dose will be tomorrow, 16Mar2021. The patient recovered from the adverse events on Mar2021 with no treatment received. The patient was not Covid-tested post-vaccination.

No period since then (due to birth control). On 03/27/2021 I started bleeding and thought how weird after all this time of not having it. The flow is light throughout the day but when go urinate there are little blood clots almost every time. The cramps are sporadic and the bleeding is going on 2nd full week without no break in between as of this date.

After talking with a family member that also had the vaccine, she confirmed same thing happen to her after the vaccine. Was surprised that the vaccine could potentially impact hormones and menstrual cycles.

                                                Heavy period and clumps the next day which was my second day of my periods. Usually the first two days are heavy but I had never seen as much flow as I saw after the vaccine. I literally I had to change every couple of hours and wear double pads.

                                                About two hours after the vaccine, I started bleeding that appeared to be the onset of a period. I thought this was a one off case of spotting - albeit a substantial amount of blood - however I went on to have a period that was very heavy and lasted 7 days. This was alarming as I have not had a period since June 25, 2020 and was diagnosed as Perimenopausal in Dec 2020 with a FSH levels of 96.3 and TSH level of 2.27 and LH level of 74.8 I have not had any spotting or periods at all since June 25, 2020. The period that I had from 3/22/2021-3/28/21 was not painful (which is abnormal for me) and was extremely heavy ever day - which is also uncommon for me. Since then I have had my second shot on 4/12 and have not experienced any adverse effects nor another period.

                                                With the first Pfizer dose on 02/16/21, I experienced immediate pain at the injection site.  This pain increased and became increasingly severe and extremely intense within 5 hours of the vaccine.  At that time other symptoms began to develop, including a very severe headache (crown/back of head), swollen glands and stiff neck, rapid heartrate, shortness of breath.  These symptoms lasted at an intense level for 2 days, and at a moderate level for a total of 14 days (last symptoms were observed on 02/23/2021).  Please also note that I started my period that month on 02/17/2021.  My second Pfizer dose was on 03/9/2021, 1:40pm.  (COVID19 Pfizer~BioNTech, Lot EN6205, intramuscular, left arm). I experienced mild pain at the injection site within 5 hours of the vaccine.  24 hours after the second dose I began to develop moderate/severe symptoms including headache (crown/back of head), swollen glands and stiff neck, rapid heartrate, shortness of breath.  These symptoms lasted at a moderate level for a total of 14 days (last symptoms were observed on 03/23/2021.  Please note that I started my period that month on 03/17/2021.  This month I started my period 2 days later than usual on 04/14/2021.  In addition to my regular menstrual symptoms (including migraine temporal headache and mild cramps), I experienced additional symptoms starting on 04/15/2021.  These included moderate/severe headache (crown/back of head), swollen glands and stiff neck, rapid heartrate, and shortness of breath.  These symptoms are still present at a moderate level today, 04/22/2021.

Very unusual for my cycle.   Also had flu like symptoms the day after my second shot for about 24 hours, but I was expecting that.  I was not expecting issues with menstruation. I have heard antidotal stories from other women that they experienced heavy and painful menstruation after the shot. Women really should be told this is a side effect if it is so they don&#39;t think something is &#34;wrong&#34; and so that they can be prepared.

This morning, four weeks and four days after the spotting incident, I spotted again.  I have no symptoms and feel 100% ok.   Nothing alarming, just unusual for my body.  Wasn&#39;t sure how deep the reporting was going, so thought I would share.

                                                6 hours post-shot I briefly had a sharp headache &amp; intense fatigue, but came &amp; went in just about half an hour.  Exactly 12 hours after my second Pfizer covid vaccine shot, I woke up at 2:25am shaking with cold for approx. 2  hours: no fever, but  couldn&#39;t stop shaking or feeling freezing even after putting on two thick sweaters &amp; four wool/down blankets. Followed by intense piercing/pressurized headache coming in waves for about the next 10 hours. At the 24-hour mark post-shot, I felt 100% better. However the same intense shaking/cold (without a fever) came back again at 30 hours post-shot and lasted another 2hrs (example of the intense shaking: my hand was shaking so hard I couldn&#39;t hold a spoon to eat soup). Felt better with a burst of energy after that which caused insomnia for a few hours (9:30pm-1:30am). Headache never returned. No arm pain until 12 hours post-shot and is still pretty painful 54 hours later. Finally, I didn&#39;t believe the anecdotal reports about the vaccine affecting menstrual cycles, but do want to mention that 48 hours post-shot my period arrived five days early; that has only happened to me once in my life (7 years ago), so I do wonder if it&#39;s connected to the &#34;shock&#34; the vaccine apparently gave my body (as evidenced by the cold/shaking/headache experience).

                                                I received the injection and was told to wait for 15 minutes. Shortly after receiving the shot, I had to use the restroom, so I asked if it was ok to do that before I sat for the 15 minutes. As I was walking to the bathroom, I felt a warm tingling sensation go through my arms (almost as if I could feel the injection going through my veins) and then the sensation traveled down my legs and my heart started RACING. This all happened within two to three minutes after receiving the shot. At first I just thought it was odd, but as I kept walking my heart rate continued to skyrocket and I did not like the way I felt. I went to the EMTs and they laid me down and hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. My blood pressure was significantly elevated (which is very unusual for me). As someone with neurocardiogenic syncope, my blood pressure typically drops - the way I felt was not at all in line with a syncopal episode.  My heart rate remained elevated while at rest, but did come down a little bit after about 20  minutes; my blood pressure would also  come down a bit while at rest but as I would lift my head (even just a little bit) to drink something my blood pressure and heart rate would again sky rocket. This went on for 1.5 hours. After about 2 hours, I was finally able to sit up without my blood pressure and heart rate going through the roof, but I felt simply awful. For the next two weeks I felt light headed (as if my head was detached from my body) and dizzy. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed in the morning without drinking a gatorade as I felt so weak and shaky. I developed significant heart palpitations that lasted for a solid month.  Additionally, I am someone who has always gotten a period at 27-28 days. I had my regular period two days after vaccination (which was when it was due), but then I got it again 16 days later. That has never before in my life happened to me. Not during illness or times of high stress.  Somehow I had a significant reaction to this vaccine and my cardiologist advised that I do not get the second.

Two weeks after, I started bleeding again. This has never happened to me before. I called my GYN Dr. and she had me take a pregnancy test (it was negative) to see if that was it or she thought maybe I could be going through early menopause. I bled for a few days and it stopped. I just received my second shot on Saturday and Sunday I started bleeding again. Here it is Thursday and I am still bleeding  about a week and a half after it finally stopped the second time after getting the first shot. I do believe the shot have me bleeding like this. Has anyone else had this problem before?  I have an appointment with the GYN on May 26th

I saw rash on my areola going towards my armpit. The lump lasted about 2 weeks and the rash resolved in about 24 hours. I had my last period April 27th, I am currently 2 months past due with my menstrual cycle. My PCP ordered blood work and I&#39;ve had two ultrasounds done to try and see what I haven&#39;t had a menstrual cycle. I also have pain in my lower right abdomen, I&#39;ve had a test done to check my appendix, but they are fine.

                                                I got the Pfizer COVID vaccine (1st shot on 4/26/21 and 2nd shot on 5/17/21). I have always had regular periods and when I got my period on 5/16, this was the first time I had it since I took the first dose of the vaccine. I noticed a change in the bleeding pattern. I typically use 4-5 maxi pads/ day on the 1st and 2nd day of my period but this time, I only had spotting on the first day that a liner was adequate for and on the second day (5/17) I used the smallest pad. The bleeding increased on days 3 &amp; 4 for which I used a small pad but overall the amount of bleeding was significantly less than normal.  I also noticed a small nodule under the skin on my lower back. It doesn&#39;t hurt and you can&#39;t see it from the outside but I can feel it if I run my fingers over my back.   My next period was on 6/13 and bleeding was light on day 1 but more than what I had in May. Bleeding increased on days 2 &amp; 3 and ultimately tapered off but over all, I just used small pads as opposed to a maxi pad the entire time.  The nodule is still present and has not changed in size. I plan to continue to monitor my cycle.

                                                I found out in May22nd that I had a positive pregnancy test - five weeks pregnant - 10 days later - symptoms subsided. June 7th - Ultrasound - dated at 5/1/2 weeks and I went back 8 days later - showed pregnancy was nonviable at that point. My miscarriage symptoms on the 17th. The miscarriage was pretty much completed that day and then I bled five or six days. No complications. I didn&#39;t need any follow up care. I had miscarriage three and half years ago and there were complications for that. I met with my midwife a few days afterwards here now but they didn&#39;t do an examination or blood draw. Pregnancy history - 13th pregnancy - 6 miscarriages and 7 live births.  Estimated date of delivery - January 22, 2022

                                                (On Tuesday, June 29th) Within the first 5 minutes, my left side and tongue went numb, I felt very lightheaded and vision faded and felt like I was going to faint. This lasted 20 minutes. I waited 40 minutes to be sure that I was okay. For the next 3 days, my joints were stiff, did not have any energy, and slept a lot. I did not get my period as scheduled, and it still has not come- am NOT pregnant.  I had a hard time recalling words, had constant headache, and lost my smell again (had covid in December, and did not get my smell back until May). I felt like an old elderly woman. I did not have any fever, body aches, or much pain in the injection site. It felt just like Covid again, except without the fever and body aches. On Friday, I was back to normal.

I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

I&#39;m in healthcare and in the operating often for airway and ENT procedures.  I received my shot at 9:00am on 1/29/20201 and began spotting at 11:00am.  The spotting continued (very light) until 9:00pm.  I decided to go to bed since I wasn&#39;t feeling well.  I woke at 2:00am with contractions and heavy bleeding.  I went to the ED at 3:00am on 1/30 to confirm my miscarriage.  I weighed 121 at the ED when triaged. My EDD was 08/19/2021

                                                For 4 days following the injection I experienced tiredness, intermittent nausea, and tenderness to both breasts. I woke from sleep dry heaving multiple times. On the 4th day after injection, it was severe enough that I took a pregnancy test because they symptoms matched that. It was negative. The following, or 5th day, all the symptoms stopped.

                                                I didn?t notice any symptoms right away.  When they started, I didn?t think it was abnormal at first. I am female and still have my menstrual cycle. This time it appeared to be heavier than usual and had some blood clots. However, before I was on birth control it was always that way. Sometimes it is a little heavier when I have more stress or the weather is not ideal. My cycle started around 2/4/21. On 2/8/21, I combed my one cat. She scratched and bit me and has done so in the past. She and I both are vaccinated and I?ve never developed any infections because of it in the past. On 2/10/21, I noticed a cluster of red pinpoint dots underneath my skin on my arms and chest. They weren?t bumpy, warm to the touch, itchy or anything. It just looked odd and I didn?t know how it happened. I work with a Nurse Practitioner and she suggested I go into to a clinic as those usually indicate an infection is developing. I went to the Urgent Care and was treated.  He did blood work on me and informed me that my glucose was a little low.  It was suppertime so that didn?t surprise me.  He told me there was no signs of infection in my blood work but was prescribing two antibiotics in case one developed. When I was getting my meds at the pharmacy, a call was coming through that I didn?t recognize so do to phone scams, I didn?t answer it. I started the antibiotics. Then over the course of 2/13/21 and 2/14/21 weekend days, I felt more fatigued than usual, nauseated, had a decreased appetite and still had my menstrual cycle. I still didn?t think much about it as a side effect of the antibiotics was nausea and decreased appetite and the fatigue could be related to it being so cold and winter usually affects my depression symptoms. Then on 2/14/21 I noticed my lower abdomen was covered in those red, pinpoint blood dot clusters and there were unexplained bruises on my body. I took a shower and when I went to wash my legs, my pelvic area was completely bloody and a blood clot dropped into the bathtub. Never has that occurred when I have my period. It looked like I had just given birth it was so much blood. I became nauseated and dry heaved several times. On 2/15/21, I sent a message to Dr asking what was happening to me. He called me and informed me that he had tried to call me the night he saw me because he saw my platelet count was only 11,000 and should be a minimum of 140,000. Dr asked that I return to Urgent Care as soon as possible.  I arrived there around 12:30 pm that day. He had bloodwork done again on me. My platelets went down to 9,000. I explained that my menstrual cycle would not stop and it should?ve but I just keep bleeding. Dr contacted a Hematologist that informed him that recently the blood disorder Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been linked with the COVID19 vaccination in rare cases. I was scheduled to be seen by a Hematologist and put on the medication prednisone to build up my platelet count. I returned to Urgent Care for blood work again on 2/16/21.  My platelets went up to 30,000. I met with Hematology on 2/17/21 and had blood work again, platelets 28,000. All providers looked over my medical record and noted that since my gastric bypass surgery in 2015, my health has been good, my blood work has been normal and I live a clean lifestyle. Again, the only issue showing up in my bloodwork was that my platelets were extremely low. Now I have weekly blood draws, take 80 mg of prednisone and have a Hematologist when just a few weeks ago my health was good.

The joints that do normally hurt were way worse (my back, and right big toe joint). There was a pain in my right eye, and that eye had blood vessels burst in it.  36 hours after the shot= started bleeding from my vagina. My last menstruation was 2 weeks ago and this is VERY unusual for me. Normally my periods are 30-32 days apart.

This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

After vaccination with Dose #2 of Pfizer Covid vaccine, had 1 menstrual cycle considered normal to my history.   Skipped the next cycle entirely without any spotting or symptoms typical of my period presentation (No chance of pregnancy). Currently experiencing the subsequent cycle and having symptoms very abnormal to my history.  Excessive and heavy bleeding, soaking through feminine products every 2-3 hours (currently in Day 3 of that symptom).  I have never experienced bleeding of this extreme in my lifetime.  OB/GYN aware, no treatment indicated at this time, follow up parameters have been provided by their office.

The day that I got the shot coincided with the day that I got my period, so I was already menstruating when the clots passed from my body. The clots were much larger than normal, and much more frequent. I passed almost a half dozen large clots. By the third day, my menstruation flow started to subside (the first two days tend to be heavier days for me). I did not pass any large clots on the third day going forward.

I started my menstrual cycle two days later. Then 10 days later, I started spotting (very unusual for me) and had another menstrual cycle a few days after that. This resulted in two cycles within 21 days, which is also very unusual for me. After the second vaccination on 4/15/21, I experienced body aches and a fever within 12-36 hours from injection. I also experienced soreness in my right breast and lymph node above the breast (now 13 days post-vaccination and this has not subsided). I also had an episode of vertigo lasting 12 hours on the 10th day after the second vaccination.

The period after the vaccine was incredibly painful and the consistency of the discharge was completely different. Pale pink clots that almost looked like uterine lining instead of clots I&#39;m used to seeing.  I want to report this because I&#39;ve talked to other women who&#39;ve had something similar but I didn&#39;t see anything about it on the CDC website.

                                                About 20 minutes after I was vaccinated, I started feeling unwell - sore throat, ears hurting/ringing, fatigue, nausea, headache. It lasted about 2.5-3 hours. After which I felt great, better than I had in a long while. The next day on Saturday, May 1, 2021, I unexpectedly started my menstrual cycle. In all my 25&#43; years of having my menstrual cycle, NEVER once have I been early or was in unexpected. I am very regular - 28-29 days. Typically heavy and lasts 7 days. The first day is always the roughest with cramping but after, it subsides. BUT on May 1, 2021 - my period started and I didn&#39;t even notice - it was light.  I will say this though - I feel like whatever was in that vaccine actually was a good thing for my body - I don&#39;t know how, but I feel great, even 3 days later. Let&#39;s hope it lasts. (As a side note- I was never diagnosed with COVID ALTHOUGH I asked my PCP in Jan 2020 when I wasn&#39;t getting better since December 2019 if I had that coronavirus  - she assured me at the time that I did not and it was not here. I was convinced myself that I had COVID in December 2019 because I had traveled. I asked her how that virus could not be here yet when we have international travel- she gave me a response but I still was not convinced. so, perhaps I did - perhaps my symptoms in 2020 were long haul covid symptoms and the vaccine helped me.

                                                Heavy irregular menstrual bleeding with cramping. Currently on day 16 of heavy bleeding. Never in my life have been irregular. I?ve been to gyno and gp for exam and bloodwork. I had two periods in a row after receiving second dose on 4/6/21. I?m still bleeding and have read other accounts of women experiencing the same.

Very unusual for personal cycle and concerning. Will seek medical care if heavy bleeding continues for much longer. Fatigue has set in and causing disruption to concentration and ability to perform work.

                                                Extremely heavy bleeding on day 2 of my period, soaking through overnight pads every 1-2 hours for a total of 30 hours. Went to the ER on 5/1/2021. Ultrasound showed no masses or fibroids, CBC values were all normal, was given an IV for hydration. Released from ER after about 6 hours as the bleeding had slowed. Bleeding intensity has reduced each day, but still bleeding bright red blood today which is day 8. My periods never last more than 5 days and I?ve never experienced this volume of menstrual blood loss in the past.

A week after #2 my menstrual cycles (which have been clockwork all of my life-I have 4 children and track it monthly)  became much more frequent and heavy with excessive clotting. I thought perhaps I was going though early menopause (44) but then realized correlation with vaccine. My mood changed, I feel sad all of the time, I am dreading recommendation of additional shots.

                                                Not adverse reaction, just a strange thing. I got my period a week early the day after receiving vaccine. This is unheard of. My period is like clockwork- a 28-day cycle, never early. Also very heavy.  My coworker who has been in menopause for six months had spotting after her second shot. The vaccine does something to women&#39;s hormones.

She thought it was weird and her ribs were burning.  She went to sleep and about 24 hours the menstrual cramps went away, but the pain in the right side remained.  By Friday the pain was wrapping around to her back, and by Saturday she felt that there was a long thin balloon pressure going from her right side of her ribs and wrapping around to her back.  It was burning type of ache.  By Saturday she had told some family members, and told her that it sounded like appendicitis and she just watched it.   Today it is a little more fainter, it is a little bit lighter.   She did the patient portal this morning and she lives next to the hospital and said if it got worse she would go to the hospital.   She is waiting to hear back from her doctor to see what she should do.  She has not taken anything for the symptoms.

                                                A few minutes after my first injection shot, I experienced a wave of nausea, flushing, and a metallic taste. I waited for 30 minutes and was assured everything was stable. During the next several days, I experienced high fevers, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and minor neuropathy (legs/feet). Over the next few weeks, I continued to have intermittent fevers, nausea, myalgia,  and episodes of numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. I consulted with my PCP on 1/28 to see if I should continue with the 2nd dose and was advised to do so. After receiving the second dose, I experienced a similar reaction as the first, with high fevers, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and minor neuropathy in my legs and feet. One new symptoms following the second dose was muscle twitching in the legs. Approximately two weeks after the second dose, I experienced acute paresthesia of both legs. It began with a bubbling sensation for two days and then progressed to an abrupt onset of burning and tingling. The muscle twitching in both legs increased and also began to appear in my arms. It is now 3 months past the second dose and I continue to have all over muscle twitching and chronic paresthesias of both legs, arms, hands, and tongue (worse in legs). I also have extreme pain in all of my fingertips,  intermittent electric shock sensations in my face and mouth, and internal vibration/buzzing sensations. My POTS symptoms which I had previously managed with adequate hydration and TriOral rehydration salts (no medication) have all been exacerbated. On a side note, I also experienced two menstrual cycles in both months that I received the vaccine and continue to have spotting between periods. I do not have a history of irregular menstrual cycles or spotting. I am currently scheduled for an ultrasound and endometrial biopsy to further assess these symptoms.

A 43-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. On Mar2021 the patient experienced heavy bleeding along with clots and things and started period couple days early after first vaccine, second period since the vaccine and was on Day 16 of period. It had gotten worse but did subside. States she had another small period in between the first and second vaccine, but that only lasted for a day. She had the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose on 22Mar2021 and a couple days after that her period started early on 03May2021 and she is now on her period and on Day 16 and it&#39;s gotten worse.  She had issues with both doses and enquired if prolonged bleeding with periods was a side effect of the vaccine and how long these periods last and if they ever end. She stated she knew there were other women with these things. She got the first Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in 01Mar2021 and shortly a day or two afterwards her period started, which was a couple days early and did not stop for 10 days. It was really, really heavy bleeding along with clots and things. She was tested for anemia in Apr2021 and her iron was low and was found to be anemic. She went to a specialist and was suggested a biopsy to rule out that there was nothing else going on. They suggested for doing an ablation to stop the bleeding or a partial hysterectomy if nothing else worked. She did not had any energy and it was hard to breath with no oxygen in blood. The outcome of the event heavy bleeding along with clots and things and started period couple days early after first vaccine, second period since the vaccine and is on Day 16 of period was unknown.

A 43-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 22Mar2021 09:00 at the age of 43-years-old (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) as first dose on 01Mar2021 at the age of 43-years-old for COVID-19 immunization (Lot Number: EN6198, Anatomical Location: left arm); started period couple days early after first vaccine from Mar2021, caller reported she got the first Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and shortly afterwards she started her period, which was a couple days early, but it didn&#39;t stop for 10 days. It was really, really heavy bleeding along with clots and things. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The caller asked if prolonged bleeding with periods was a side effect of the vaccine. She stated she had both doses of the vaccine and had this issue with both. She stated she knows there has been other woman who have come forward saying they have these things. At the time, her doctor had not heard anything about any reactions to it. Her iron has been low and she got tested for anemia and was anemic now. She has had her second period since the vaccine and was on day 16 of period. It was still going on strong and she was wondering if this was something that Pfizer has heard of happening after the vaccine. She had first BionTech vaccine on 01Mar2021 and her period started a day or two after that. It had gotten worse, but did subside. She was normally super regular and super normal with her periods. Stated she did have another small period in between the first and second vaccine, but that only lasted for a day, which was really weird for her and did not usually happen. Had the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose on 22Mar2021 and a couple days after that her period started and she was now on her period and on Day 16 and it&#39;s gotten worse. This one stared early May, 03May2021 and was also still going strong and really wants this to be resolved since going on her honeymoon soon. Caller clarified event of periods. She had been checked for anemia in Apr2021 and told she was anemic. Has also gone to specialist to see what&#39;s going on. They suggested a biopsy to rule out that there was nothing else going on. If nothing else works they are talking about doing an ablation to stop the bleeding or a partial hysterectomy, where they just take the uterus, since they know that&#39;s causing her anemia and since the bleeding won&#39;t stop long enough for her to get her blood supply back up where she needs it. Has not had any energy and it&#39;s hard to breath with no oxygen in her blood. Physician office was for period still ongoing and strong, really heavy bleeding with clots, iron low, anemic, no energy, hard to breath with low oxygen in blood, saw a specialist. The patient experienced period still ongoing and strong, really heavy bleeding with clots in Mar2021; prolonged bleeding with periods in Mar2021; had been checked for anemia in Apr2021 and told she was anemic/ iron has been low; Has not had any energy; it&#39;s hard to breath with no oxygen in her blood. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021568087 same patient/drug and different dose/event.

The patient reported that within the last 2 weeks, she began experiencing right arm pain and right breast pain. She reports that up until last Friday morning (11Jun2021), it was tolerable, but Friday morning she experienced right breast pain and her right breast feels &#34;heavier&#34; and &#34;tighter&#34; than her left and it feels like &#34;lumps&#34;. Her right breast feels heavier than the left one. She says that she does not take medication of any kind and that the covid-19 vaccine is the first thing she&#39;s had in 10-12 years. She states that she will call her doctor but may not take anything if they prescribe it and will just wait and see if this will go away on its own. She also reported being able to see the difference in size. She reports she read online that these side effects are normal and is calling today to ask if these symptoms have been reported. Her right arm does not hurt all the time, just sometimes. She is asking if she should be concerned and see a doctor. Before she had her period, she felt heaviness in her right breast. It was not something she really noticed; it is there every month. But on Friday, 11Jun2021, she really noticed it. Her right breast felt heavier. It felt different while she was walking, and she was feeling heaviness on her right breast. The next day her right arm was not hurting, but today her arm is hurting hard. She has been trying to drink a lot of water and juice, hoping it will get better. She does not take medications. This is the first time she has taken any medication in 20 years. She states yesterday was a little better, but not much of a difference. There was a very little difference between today and yesterday. Her breast and arm hurt worse whenever she is walking. She is fine, she knows this is because of the vaccine. She is asking should she be concerned. She did not want it initially. Everyone was taking it. She was not sure if she was doing the right thing by not taking it. She works. She felt pressure from society and her family to take the covid vaccine. It took her a couple of weeks to decide if she should get it or not. She does not take medications. She was not sure if she should get the covid vaccine or not, and it was bothering her. The patient stated that she does not have any medical conditions to include. She does not have very good stamina. She gets tired easy. She is on a diet to maintain that. She is not a weak person; she goes on hikes. She must work on her balance. The patient was not recovered from the events.

                                                I did not experience anything until 12 hours later. Severe hard cramping in both of my legs and feet while I was sleeping. The next day the fatigue was normal but the leg cramping is worse. I still have the leg cramping. I did an ultrasound for blood clotting and blood work. It was a week after the vaccine and you were still feeling it. The tiredness went away but the cramping is still present. It skipped a period and you have had a very inconsistent cycle. My period seems to be normal now but that was after the vaccine was administered.

                                                First Vaccine Dose on 12/26/2020 felt extremely fatigued. After 2nd vaccine dose on 01/16/2021 developed fever, chills, weakness, fatigue, body aches approximately 10 hours after received the 2nd dose. This all lasted about 24 hours. Then on 01/19/2021 which was the 2nd day of mine menstrual cycle, I had a very abnormal menstruation. I was passing &#34;fist&#34; size blood clots  which made me very weak. this lasted again about 24 hours then it stopped. I had some labs drawn on 02/27/2021 which came back with very low Iron, Hematocrit and Hemoglobin levels.  I usually do show signs of anemia in previous blood work but this time the levels dropped lower so i was referred to see a Hematologist.

                                                My menstrual cycle runs like a clock.  It was not due to happen until April 8th but I got it a week early.  I am well aware of how each day goes in my cycle and the flow has been significantly off this cycle.  The only variable was my vaccination shot.  The injection site was sore, I got headaches and the site itched for days approx 48hrs after the shot.  The cycle was almost like spotting for the first 2 days when normally the first 2-3 days are heavy.  I am going on a week of the cycle and have only had 1 normal flow day yesterday when usually after 5 days the cycle is ending.  Also had this odd burning spot on my chest and back but it only would last a few seconds.

                                                About 4 hours after the first vaccine, numbness and tingling all over the body. Left arm went completely numb and tingling. Scalp tingling and numb. Felt like circulation was cut off. Severe Shortness of breath. Extreme feeling of adrenaline. The next day on March 14th, had extreme vaginal bleeding on day 14 of cycle. Bled for another 7 days which led to extreme anemia. The shortness of breath is every day since the first dose. Heart palpitations (heart rate went up to 190!). After the second dose on 4/03, all symptoms got worst. Left leg went completely numb the same day which I went to the emergency room for. The neurological tingling and numbness was spreading to my whole body. Arms, legs, face, ears, scalp, inside my head. I was worried for a heart attack since all of my symptoms of left arm and shoulder pain and numbness etc. I was released from the emergency room 12 hours later. I continued to have severe symptoms. The shortness of breath was so bad that I didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights straight because my oxygen would drop. I also had severe insomnia and no appetite and lost 5 pounds in 1 week. Major adrenaline feeling. I went back to the emergency room 2 more times this week to check out my heart and lungs. All of my doctors recommended ER since they couldn&#39;t help me. My neurologist said he is getting lots of these symptoms from people post vaccine.  My shortness of breath and elevated heart rate and numbness and tingling are still here and I can barely go up and down stairs without being out of breath and having a 130-140 heart rate and super low blood pressure and night sweats. It is awful.

                                                Sore arm in the evening for a few hours on the day I received my vaccine. That was not concerning but what was concerning is that my menstrual cycle started 2 weeks early (3 days after the shot). I may be in my forties but I am still very regular (have been for years and throughout this pandemic) so this is a big change for me. I am curious how my future menstrual cycles will be affected or if this is a one time deal (my hope).

                                                My menstrual cycle is late. I had no idea this was a known side effect. I have reached out to other women on Social Media and most of them have reported the same issue with their menstrual cycle. Please make this known to every woman getting vaccinated. Despite the side effects, I am grateful for this vaccination. However knowing that my menstrual cycle might be disrupted would have avoided emotional anguish, wasting over a hundred dollars on pregnancy tests, and a major anxiety attack.

On the second day my temperature regulated but I still had a headache, nausea, body fatigue. Noticed heart palpations intermediately throughout the day, while moving, lying down and sitting. On the third day still had a slight headache, slim body fatigue and noticed more consistent heart palpations.   Also started my menstruation cycle on Saturday as well.  Experienced more intense menstrual cramps than normal.  It&#39;s the fourth day now and still feel the heart palpations more sporadically than yesterday and intense menstrual cramps. Please note that I already had a irregular heart beat prior too covid but I noticed a significant increase in the occurence of the heart palpations. Normally I only have them once a month or once very few months.  This has been several times a day and on Sunday seemed to be experiencing hourly.

I am not or have not had any other changes that could possibly have affected my cycle aside from vaccine.  I thoroughly researched and went over my medical/health/stress/activity and finally googled if it was possible or any others were known.

                                                The day of the first shot, I developed soreness in my arm, headache, fatigue. The next day, my side effects continued and worsened.  On 4/4/21, my symptoms continued and I developed more fatigue, fever,  nausea, chills, early period, and abdominal pain.  On 4/5/21, these side effects continued and the abdominal pain increased.  On 4/6/21,   ER determined that I developed acute appendicitis.  My appendix ruptured and I had to have an appendectomy.

                                                I have an IUD and usually have light, short periods. I began my period the day or two after the second COVID vaccine. It was somewhat heavier than normal and lasted a few days longer than normal. I am fine and required no treatment for this, but hearing about similar experiences I wanted to report this though some time has passed.

                                                PMS symptoms; nipples became very hard and sore.; swollen breast tissue; Menses late and hasn&#39;t started; symmetrical lumps on the distal sides of my breasts; faint; slight injection site soreness; intense tingly whole body sensations; Sense of pressure and tingling on eyeballs; Increased sensitivity to touch; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 44-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 30Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Mild/moderate TBI in Oct1999 with herniated disk in lower lumbar region from auto accident (patient was a pedestrian and a car ran into her); fractured tibia/fibula from occurrence; low blood pressure which she had occasionally fainted from at blood draws (started after being active athletically during recovery from 1999 injury). Patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications (no vaccine in 4 weeks and no other medication in two weeks). Patient did faint 15 minutes after receiving Pfizer Covid vaccine on 30Mar2021. Medical people at vaccination site made a vasovagal note on record. Patient reported that there were no body aches or fatigue or fever, only slight injection site soreness for a couple of days which was hard to notice through intense tingly whole body sensations that started after receiving vaccine on 30Mar2021 16:15. Still continuing to feel a week and a half later. It was very uncomfortable but not painful. Patient also experienced sense of pressure and tingling on eyeballs and increased sensitivity to touch. Menses were due one week after vaccination but 4.5 days after vaccination on 03Apr2021, nipples became very hard and sore. After a few days on nipples slightly sore still but mostly swollen breast tissue with soreness on Apr2021. Patient had not had this as PMS symptom since becoming pregnant almost 9 years ago and it never lasted 7.5 days with it still ongoing as of time of report. Her menses was late on Apr2021 and hasn&#39;t started but she was not pregnant. Patient&#39;s usual PMS symptoms have kind of started yesterday on 09Apr2021. It quickly formed bilaterally symmetrical lumps on the distal sides of her breasts which was also unusual on Apr2021. No treatment was received and events results in doctor&#39;s clinic visit. Outcome of the events was not recovered. Patient was not diagnosed with covid prior to vaccination and had not been tested post vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the event syncope and the suspect suspect vaccine BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I have never had migraines, however I have had three debilitating migraine headaches since the vaccines.  My menstrual cycles  have always been normal, but since the vaccines my periods are about two weeks apart and I am flowing incredibly heavy, unlike ever before!  I have a rash on my left butt cheek that won?t go away and it feels like I have a rectal hemorrhoid.  I am have been super tired and no energy.  Before the vaccines I was in great shape and very healthy!

A 44-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Apr2021 15:45 (3:45 PM) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history includes Shellfish Allergy (Reported she has had a shellfish allergy for a long time, approximately 7-8 years). She said as long as she had no shellfish, she was completely fine. There were no concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date as the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient previously took bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunization on 14Mar2021 first dose intramuscular at the left arm (Lot Number: EN6208). It was reported that the patient has received both doses of the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Her second Pfizer Covid vaccine was received on 04Apr2021. Caller started her menstrual cycle on 07Apr2021. She experienced abnormal vaginal bleeding that night. The following day on 08Apr2021 she passed out at work and was transported to the ER via ambulance. She was advised by the ER provider that her symptom was not related to the Covid 19 vaccine. However, she spoke with her OBGYN and was advised they have heard that abnormal bleeding maybe caused by the Covid 19 vaccine. The patient asked if symptom has been reported? It was further reported that she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 14Mar2021, and her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Apr2021 at 3:45 PM (PST). She clarified later in the day on 04Apr2021, the COVID-19 Vaccine kicked in. She said she felt sick on 05Apr2021. She said she felt uncomfortable on the morning of 05Apr2021, but still went to work. She said she felt OK once she got to work, but then took time off from work (on 05Apr2021) because she felt uncomfortable. She said when she got home from work (on 05Apr2021), she took 2 Tylenol. She said she was cold, and her body temperature went up, and she was kind of sweating. She clarified her hands and feet were cold, and later in the day (05Apr2021) her body temperature went up. She said she was aware of the COVID-19 side effects because some of her friends had similar symptoms, so she was kind of expecting the symptoms. She said later in the evening on 05Apr2021, she took 2 Advil and went to bed. She said her body felt warm, but she thought her symptoms were to be expected. She said on 07Apr2021, her (menstrual) period started at 10:00 PM. She said she had abnormal (more than usual) vaginal bleeding for the whole night. She said on 08Apr2021, she felt uncomfortable in the morning when she was getting ready for work. She said she went to work (on 08Apr2021), and at 1:30 PM passed out while at work. She said from her work, she was sent by ambulance to the Emergency Room. She said she was not sure if her passing out had anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine, but she had never passed out at work before. She said she asked the Emergency Room doctor about the COVID-19 Vaccine and her passing out. She said the Emergency Room doctor said her passing out had nothing to do with her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she read more online about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she then asked the nurse at her OBGYN&#39;s office about abnormal bleeding after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the nurse had heard of some cases of abnormal bleeding after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her OBGYN&#39;s nurse told her to call to find out if her abnormal bleeding had anything to do with her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her OBGYN&#39;s nurse provided her with the number to get more information about the COVID-19 Vaccine. It was added that while she was at the Emergency Room, she had 7 vials of blood taken, 2 ultrasounds; an external one of her tummy (abdominal ultrasound), and an internal one where something was stuck in her (transvaginal ultrasound). She said she did not know the results of her testing, and was waiting for a copy of her medical records.  The patient also weighed 165 lbs on an unspecified date. It was reported that for the treatment she had taken 2 Tylenol and 2 Advil at different times while at home, but was at work, and didn&#39;t have the Tylenol or Advil to provide the dosing, NDC, Lot, and Expiration Dates. For the Emergency Room treatment she reported an EKG was done, and she was given an IV drip. She said she was not sure what IV fluids were given to her. The patient required visit to Emergency Room and stated she was taken by ambulance on 08Apr2021 and discharged from the Emergency Room at 6:00 PM the same day.  The patient also visited Physician Office and stated she went for a follow-up with her OBGYN doctor at between 9:00 AM-10:00 AM on 09Apr2021. She said the Emergency Room doctor had called her OBGYN doctor on 08Apr2021, while she was in the Emergency Room. The patient underwent laboratory tests which includes: EKG, Blood Test, Abdominal Ultrasound, Transvaginal Ultrasound (All tests were performed while at the Emergency Room on 08Apr2021. Patient stated she was waiting for a copy of her medical records with the test results). The outcome of the events was recovered on Apr2021.

Otherwise, I was extremely exhausted and in bed for a week, though as mentioned, I did have a mild cold going into it. I also had a fever and chills, but I can&#39;t say if it was the cold or shot. Since I was still ill after a week and a half, I visited Urgent Care to make sure it wasn&#39;t COVID or bronchitis and got the all-clear.

After having a normal period I continued spotting for 3 weeks. Some more than others. I then got my second dose on 5/7/2021 ( lot EW0167 ) and starting bleeding again like a period and I now have been bleeding and/or spotting for over 4 weeks. ( still bleeding lightly as of today 5/16/2021 ). Not sure if it is related to the vaccine but this has never happened to me before.

                                                I had a normal menstrual period on April 19 (27 days after the previous one) but then I started bleeding again on May 1, only 11 days later. The bleeding has been light on some days, then it switched to medium, then back to light, then medium again... and  it continued for 17 days now. I searched for possible explanations for this, and found that other women are noticing this after their covid vaccine, so I decided to report it. I will see my ObGyn in three days for this issue. This type of long, 2&#43; week vaginal bleeding has never happened to me before.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). A 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, ER8729) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 10Apr2021 09:30 at age of 44-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing endometriosis, allergy: penicillin and heavy periods pertains to her endometriosis. The patient had no concomitant medications (reported as &#34;no other products&#34;). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EN6203) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 14Mar2021 at 09:30, at age of 44-year-old for COVID-19 immunization, with the first dose everything was fine, she had a little fatigue, but all fine. The patient had some symptoms that were normal and subsided. Caller had a delay in her menstrual cycle after her second dose on 30Apr2021 and was still delayed. She took pregnancy tests to rule out pregnancy. She was not irregular, that&#39;s why she did the test. She had heavy periods, cycles every 25-28 days and heaviness pertains to her endometriosis. It abnormal for her and she was thinking on behalf of her 14 year old daughter. Caller asked if the vaccine affecting girls that are menstruating and would it affect their fertility or delay or affect them in the long term. Caller would normally go through her normal OBG/GYN, but was referred to call Pfizer. Caller asked if other women called with similar experience, she was trying to get alleviated that it was normal. She obviously didn&#39;t care, she had her 4 kids. She didn&#39;t want her daughter to be dealing with this down the line. Caller was 4 days late, but was still in the window to get it on time. Caller felt this is important to report. Caller may be a week or so late. She took an iron supplement. Caller had nothing after the 1st dose. On 13Apr2021, she had fatigue, low grade fever, nausea for 2-3 weeks after the second dose with lower back pain.  The nausea was a concern to caller because it didn&#39;t lift after a few days.  She had read about it through the CDC, but had no symptoms until 2 days after. Caller&#39;s low back pain was centralized, middle of back, like tailbone, and has not resurfaced. Her temperature was like 100 degrees and lasted 24-48 hours, not as long as back pain and nausea. Caller had fatigue with her endometriosis and issues.  She is still doing her normal routine, she was pretty fatigued that 2 weeks, and not like herself. Caller wanted to make sure and she got a pregnancy test, because the nausea hadn&#39;t lifted and the last time she felt that kind of sickness was with her pregnancy. The nausea stopped, but her period hasn&#39;t come. It was all the second dose. After the first dose, for 24-48 hours, she took it easy and monitored herself. She was lightheaded more with the whole 2 weeks and dizzy at times.  She was not eating as well, her appetite was suppressed and she feels is was all related. It was on and off, but caller didn&#39;t document the exact dates, but she recovered from all the symptoms for the most part. Caller didn&#39;t expect a lengthy call, she was seeing if she experienced normal side effects and wanting to know about her daughter. The events did not require a visit to emergency room. Nausea and back pain fatigue and lightheaded require a visit to physician office. The outcome of events &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;lower back pain&#34; was recovered on 27Apr2021, the outcome of event &#34;low grade fever&#34; was recovered on 15Apr2021, the outcome of event &#34;delayed menstrual cycle&#34; was not recovered, the outcome of event &#34;severe fatigue&#34; was recovered in Apr 2021, the outcome of other events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday at 12pm. Late afternoon: fatigue, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes on left side of upper body, swollen left breast with pain and heaviness feeling that lasted for 2-3 days, Lupus butterfly rash on face, flu-like symptoms, spike in temperature to 100º, dizziness, heat radiating off body, and migraine. I took my prescribed Meloxican (for Lupus joint/muscle pain) approx 2:30pm and then my prescribed Fioricet for the migraine.   Friday evening: Approximately 8pm I broke out in hives on my trunk; stomach, chest, shoulders, and back. The migraine worsened to include nausea with sensitivity to light, sound and smell. I took my prescribed Zomeg with no relief. The migraine was so severe that it kept me in bed with pain for hours that once I had some relief to be able to stand to go look in the mirror at the hives, it was approximately 1am. I put hydrocortisone cream on the areas I could reach and took Benadryl. It took over an hour to fall asleep. Saturday: I took Allegra. The hives were still prominent and itchy. Sunday: The hives were still there but most were on my shoulders and back, while some still remained on my stomach but not as prominent. The hives were still itchy. The other symptoms have subsided except the migraine, which was dull, and fatigue. Monday: The hives were not as prominent but somewhat itchy. They were some remaining on my shoulders. They other symptoms subsided with the exception of a dull migraine which I managed with Fioricet. I made the first available appointment with my primary doctor.  Tuesday: I saw my primary doctor. Per my physician I still have hives on my trunk. I was instructed to continue with interventions. As of 5/19/2021, I had been treating the hives, fatigue, and migraines which occurred unexpectedly.  The hives have subsided completely by Thursday, 5/20/2021.

I?m always have a very regular cycle and it became erratic after receiving the vaccine. With my cycle going from 27-28 days to anywhere from 10-23 days.  Also very heavy clotting and menstrual pain. Have never expelled clots in such a manner other than after childbirth.  I do get cold sores, usually about once sometimes twice a year. I?ve had four since the vaccine.  Sharp pain in my right ear not otherwise explained by infection and not present prior to vaccines. Feels like an ear ache: comes and goes.

                                                3 hours after injection, developed profuse sweating on neck in air conditioned room followed by hives on neck and chest, itching, pain. was advised to take benadryl. fell asleep within one hour. Hives reoccured every day for one week. I still have redness and bumps.  12 hours after injection, developed very sore arm, pain with range of motion, headache which resolved with Motrin, fatigue-slept 18 hours. 3 days after injection developed diarrhea which is still occuring 3 weeks after. developed severe PMS 2 weeks earlier than usual which has never happened. Breasts not just tender-they hurt. terrible cramps, which i never get. bleeding through super ultra tampon every 45 minutes which has never happened. Unable to exercise because of dizziness and fatigue. I typically exercise 5 days per week including jogging, hiking, resistance training. today, June 3,  I became very confused and felt like my brain wasnt sending signals to my body. I cannot remember what I needed to do 5 minutes ago. I went to fill up my sink to do dishes and poured water on the counter instead of drain, I poured coffee in my eye.

Up until this point I have always had regular, clockwork cycles. I will not be getting the second dose until this stops due to the risk of anemia now.

I have been bleeding for 3 weeks straight.  I have never had irregular periods.   I truly feel this irregular period/heavy bleeding was caused by the vaccine.

                                                Since getting the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I haven&#39;t had a period since December. Many other women have reported this same issue but it still has not been addressed or acknowledged publicly or privately by the CDC.  My concerns and questions are:   1. What studies have you performed in regards to covid vaccine and women&#39;s periods? 2. What permanent side effects will this cause to my cycle and ability to have children? 3. Will my periods normalize back to what they were before  I received the vaccine? 4. Will I need medical treatment? 5. Does the vaccine cause premature menopausal symptoms? 6. Will this issue with the vaccine and periods be publicly addressed soon?

My periods are regular and last for three days with light flow. I have had heavy flow for eight days. I am still bleeding. In addition I had severe vertigo and mild fever for five days after receiving the vaccine beginning on day two and ending on day 6. I could not move my head without significant spinning sensation. The vertigo has now subsided. I have never experienced vertigo in my life. It was debilitating. Thankfully it has subsided. My mother who is 74 also experienced vertigo after both her first and second Covid vaccination - Pfizer. She still has vertigo in the mornings three months after the second vaccine.

Next day, I woke up to heavy flu-like symptoms (fever, body ache) and my period. Still going on Day 2; it&#39;s not my heaviest but definitely full-blown. I&#39;m reporting this because many women might be adversely affected.

                                                irregular periods; Got period again; Arm was a little sore; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumer. This 44-year-old female patient reported for herself that she received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0177, Expiry date: 31Aug2021) via an unspecified route of administration into the right arm on 06Jun2021 (at the age of 44-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: UNKNOWN, Expiry date: 30Sep2021) via an unspecified route of administration into the right arm on 30Jun2021 at 11 AM as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced irregular periods. 0n 06Jun2021, her arm was a little sore and on 24Jun2021, she got periods again. Within 4-5 hours after vaccination, the right arm was getting sore, later in the evening there was minor soreness. She knew that the second shot would be worse. She was able to deal with the discomfort through the night. That day, her right arm was visibly pulsating and twitching.  She explains that she can move her arm halfway up freely, otherwise if she moves it up any further the pulsating was worse. Pain really was not an issue. She has experienced irregular periods since her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. She has had two periods in a month since her first dose Jun2021. Referred to HCP for continued evaluation and treatment. She reported that the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine was totally fine. Later, in the evening before going to bed, her arm was a little sore.  It was nothing major and went away the second day. On 01Jul2021, obviously her arm was still sore, but now a throbbing was happening and inquired if that was normal. If she just puts her arm down, her arm was almost pulsating like a heart. The pulsating was not hurting, it was just weird. The reason that she waited a few days before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is because she got her period twice in Jun2021. She had her period on 01Jun2021 and then got the shot on 05Jun2021 and her period was over.  Then she got her period again in Jun2021 and that never happens to her. She got her period on 24Jun2021 again and said that she was not going to be on her period getting the second Covid-19 shot. Her period completed on 28Jun2021, but she waited until 30Jun2021 to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was taking Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to protect her family. Outcome was unknown for event irregular periods. Outcome was resolved for events arm was a little sore on 07Jun2021 and got period again on 28Jun2021.  Caller reported that a couple of hours after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, immediately after 4-5 hours, she felt the shot in her arm. She still has soreness in her arm.  With the soreness, it kind of hurts to move her arm but it was nothing excruciating.  She could not really lift her arm up high or anything, but it was getting better. Arm was throbbing: It was pulsing even her child can see it and it just started happening and had never seen anything like that. She needed to call somebody because that was just weird.

Around midnight I took Motrin, 600mg. The next morning, my temp was normal. I then had back and arm pain. The arm pain was like a nerve pain. I called  my PCP on the 11th. Dr. said she thought it was idiopathic brachial plexopathy. She prescribed Prednisone at 50mg and tapered down over 4 weeks. I had an MRI of my brachial plexus and that showed inflammation. I rested my arm for 4 weeks and then I started physical therapy this week. I will be seeing another neurologist next week that specializes in neuromuscular disorders. He might order a nerve study.

It feels like a pulled muscle but is also in the same area as a breast tumor that was removed decades ago. My right arm and right breast are tender to the touch and I have occasional sharp pain I the breast. No feeling of lumps though.

                                                Incredible pain in right ovary so bad I thought it might have burst or been a burst appendix. Had to go to emergency care on April 5th. April 6th got period. Should not have had period so soon. Highly irregular. So much pain.

                                                I got the 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on day 3 of my period.  Normally I have very regular periods that end completely by day 7. But since getting the vaccine, my period has lasted for 14 days with no signs of stopping.  On day 13, for a few hours I bled so heavily that I went to urgent care.  Since it was Saturday night and they&#39;re a small clinic, they couldn&#39;t conduct any real lab tests and I must wait till Monday to see my obgyn.  Prior to getting the vaccine, I NEVER had this much excess bleeding, and I never bled longer than 7 days (now it&#39;s been 14 days and counting) I am alarmed that the vaccine has clearly affected the length and intensity of my menstrual cycle, and no doctor seems to know why.

                                                Initially, I felt fine. Several hours later I began to feel run down, like a cold. I then began to have an ache near my right kidney that I attributed to laying weirdly. However, I also began experiencing a sort of menstrual cramping on my right side as well. This has persisted since Friday night. Today (4/12/21) at about 02:30 pm, I got my period 10 days early! This isn&#39;t normal for me. Right now it is as if I&#39;m spotting (dark discharge to warn that full-on bleeding will happen soon). I don&#39;t usually spot. My period is rather predictable and I have been dutiful in my tracking as my cycle has shortened over the years, going from a 28 day to 25 day cycle. The malaise and aches are consistent with my PMS, but I just wasn&#39;t expecting my period right now. I really don&#39;t understand how this is happening.

                                                I got the Mirena IUD in June of 2018 and have not had a period for 2 years. (I did get a light period this past august and had similar symptoms as now, but that was the only time). 4 days after getting my guest Pfizer dose, I started experiencing light cramping that felt like period cramps. Since then, I keep feeling like I&#39;m about to get my period with light cramping, bloating and fatigue. Today I am experiencing spotting. (Tomorrow will be 2 weeks since I received my first Pfizer dose). As I haven&#39;t had a period for 2 years, I&#39;m not sure if the timing is in keeping with when I would have had a period. It feels to me like it&#39;s connected to the vaccine. I have not seen a doctor as the symptom isn&#39;t that bad, just surprising.

                                                A couple of days after the receiving the vaccine I started having severe heart palpitations. I noticed that a hemangioma on my lip was extremely swollen and black and blue looking while experiencing the palpitations. I was also dizzy. I sent pictures of mu lip to my doctor at college and he encouraged me to see my primary care doctor. Both doctors agree that they suspect I had a blood clot. I also haven&#39;t had a regular period since the vaccine. I had one brief period shortly after the vaccine, and it was unlike my periods before the vaccine. I haven&#39;t had a period in two months and I don&#39;t believe that is coincidental as I was 28 days regular before the vaccine.

I am constantly nauseated, and my reflux was out of control. That seems to be resolved. I got tested after I experienced chest pain and my Potassium was very low. My EKG indicated a heart problem. That was seven weeks after my shot. Now my fingers turning white on both hands. I also had an issue with late periods. I was one week late after the first shot and two weeks late after the second shot. I have chronic migraines and since my vaccines I have had long lasting migraines that have lasted up to ten days. I have had multiple visits to the Urgent care and my primary care doctor. I have a GI scope scheduled 04/26/2021.

                                                Severe flu like symptoms. Woke up with body so sore it was hard to get out of bed. Severe chills. Fever. Headache.  Vomited about 16 hours after shot. Slept for 19 hours out of 24 hours. Got shot on 4/12/21 at 11:20 AM, on 4/14/21 woke up to a sweaty shirt, fever broke. When taking a shower the same morning, I found a baseball/softball size lump between my breast and armpit on my right side. The same side as my shot. My right arm also had redness, and a small bump where the shot was given. It was extremely sore.  Currently it is 4/16/21 and although the symptoms are getting progressively better, and significantly mild, I am still sore, have low energy and the lump is still there.  I did not have any reaction other than a slightly sore arm to the first dose.

                                                I had my first dose of Covid vaccine, Pfizer 30ug at 3:40pm on 4/8/21. 1 day after my first dose I started have low fever(98.8-99.2f). 2 days after my first dose of Covid vaccine my left breast start being painful and start whole body ache. 4 days after first dose my left breast start having an half egg size painful touchable lump with red, warm and swelling.  I started taking Acetaminophen 10 mg bid. 4 days on 4/11 till today after first dose  for both pain control and reducing body temperature.  I used to have granulomatous mastitis on my right breast which is self limited and I had not have this problem for one year. Although the mechanism is still unclear but some theory of this disease is more like an autoimmune  problem.   I doubt somehow this vaccine has too strong immunogenicity, or at least which is too strong for me. I was getting Pfizer which is 30ug I think.  Possibility: 1 Too large dose for my body size (120 lb) 2 Some adjuvant in this Pfizer vaccine induces too strong cellular immune response which may initiate or help for some none Covid specific antibody production, unfortunately for some patients who have autoimmune disease are triggered by this vaccine then they may start producing autoimmune antibody which start self attacking.

                                                A few days after the shot I started experiencing premenstrual symptoms. I found that very strange as I have always had a very regular 28 day cycle and I had just finished a period. Day 1 of my previous cycle was April 2. On day 13 (the 15th of this month) of my cycle I started spotting pink then menstruating. This period if still ongoing now and feels very different from my regular period. I have another girlfriend who experienced the same and I have read reports about this happening on Facebook. I am extremely concerned that the vaccine disrupted my hormones and normal body functions.

Approximately 24 hours after receiving my second COVID vaccine, my bleeding became very heavy and I passed a large amount of clots. This lasted approximately 8 hours then stopped.

                                                Had other benign side effects (Muscle Pain, Headache, Not Feeling  Well) but that hasn&#39;t concerned me.   What has concerned me is that out of NOWHERE I started my period Just 2 weeks after starting my last one - with no warning and it is heavy with cramping/pain.  I have endometriosis (diagnosed at 19 and 3 surgeries since) - the only &#34;irregularity&#34; I have is that it is LATE a lot.  I have never been &#34;early&#34; and it has never started without warning and heavy at onset.  I usually have a day prior of spotting and migraine. This time, I went to the ladies room, had bad abdominal pain and all of a sudden - my period is here - out of nowhere.  I am writing here because I do feel this is an adverse effect.

I am perimenopausal and irregular but I haven?t had that type of extreme heavy flow since I was in my 20?s. No bad cramps though which is good.

Not sure if it is related to the Pfizer vaccine, but thought I should report since you all are collecting data and monitoring.  Period had started on time the day before I got first shot (Mar 7) and stopped the day of shot (Mar 8).  Then it  came back and had normal duration 17 days later.    Received second shot on Mar 30.  This month, period came on time (28 days since last one) but has lasted longer than normal (currently at 8 days).   I have noticed no other issues since getting shots, other than fatigue and lightheadedness in the days right after.

My sister and friend; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer. This consumer reported similar events for 3 patients (her sister, friend and herself). This is a 1st of 3 reports. A 45-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My menstrual cycle started early and has not stopped . It has been 12 days of menstrual bleeding and this has never happened before. It started the week after my 2nd vaccine shot. My sister and friend have reported a similar side effect and we do not believe it is coincidence. We think it is a side effect of the COVID 19 vaccine. Outcome of events was unknown.

                                                At the time of my first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine, I was at the end of my menstrual cycle. 8 days following the first dose, I began bleeding again. Unlike a monthly cycle, the bleeding was light in color ?watered-down? and bright red and appeared as a ?fresh wound? vs clotting- type blood during a monthly cycle. The bleeding required sanitary pads and tampons. The bleeding continued for 4 days.  Three weeks after the first dose and two weeks after the start of the aforementioned irregular bleeding , my menstruation cycle began again. The cycle was heavy, with cramping. The cycle lasted 7 days.    I felt it was necessary to report this because my cycle is normally 30-32 days and has been since having children 11 years ago. I do not spot mid cycle and have no instances of an ?early period?. I have not missed a period except in pregnancy. I?m what is considered ?regular?. I do not suffer from anxiety, I?m not afraid of vaccines or needles and have not experienced weight gain or loss. I mention this because I have read these factors could potentially the cause of unusual menstruation related to the COVID vaccine

                                                The same adverse reaction that happened with the first dose happened again with the second dose. The only difference was instead of being the following day, this time the increased menstrual bleeding and clotting began 3 days following the vaccine. I received the vaccine this time on 5/14/21 and today, 5/17/21 I suddenly began bleeding mid-day with noticeable clotting that is not normal for me. I was again at the end of a period cycle much like last time, and not bleeding prior to this event.

It should be clarified that I have zero history of irregular cycles.  Initially, went to clinic when I could not get in with my Dr.  they treated me for BV, YI though I had no symptoms associated with either of those infections.  2 weeks later symptoms again, I got an appointment with my regular Dr who advised the pelvic pain was from the vaccine and to give it 3-4 months to calm down my cycle.  In the meantime, the results from the clinic came back with an abnormal pap  with HPV.  It is my belief that the vaccine triggered HPV.   I&#39;ve been super healthy and never have issues.

(My periods are typically mostly normal and even though I have had heavy bleeding in the past on a few occasions, I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before.) After the 2nd shot, in addition to the menorrhagia, I also woke up the next morning with a large (about the size of a dime) subconjunctival hemorrhage in my right eye, at the top center portion of the sclera. It is mostly hidden underneath my eyelid, but is visible when I pull my eyelid back or when I look down or to the sides. (I have never had one of these before and it scared me, so I made an appointment to have it checked out.) Also, after the second shot, I have been experiencing bleeding gums when I brush or floss my teeth, which is also something new and unexpected and not something I typically or have ever experienced. It has now been 6 days since the second shot and I am still bleeding (heavy period bleeding with large clots), my right eye still has the large bloody spot (about the size of a dime), but thankfully my gums have stopped bleeding.

Felt like i sprained it. The pain was there for two and a half days and suddenly it went away and i was ok. Now this past sunday January 10th my period came, 15 days earlier, and is really bad. I have to change pads like every two hours because of the amount of blood coming down and is still going on today. It has never lasted this long and I have not bleed this much for this long either.

Now, as today 2/3/2021 I started to have my menstrual period again (just 2 weeks after the previous menstrual period) I always have my menstrua periods regularly every 26 to 28 days. There was only one time in 2012 when I had Dengue virus that my menstrual period came very early as well, at that point I had a CBC done showing thrombocytopenia with Platelets at 110.  I am planning to have a CBC test done. I suspect that my platelets are low again. I want to make sure the vaccine is not causing me thrombocytopenia and to report this event for future data collection.

I didnt feel well all that day and I missed work the next day. Those symptoms have gone away. However, I have been in menopause for 2 years. Havent had a period or spotting at all. The day after the vaccine I started spotting. Really light but consistent. It is still occurring now... and we are 5 days after my vaccine.

Since the vaccine I have started bleeding and the bleeding has gotten worse each day.  Along with the period I am now getting cramps that I have never had in the past. Also feel very foggy in the head.

                                                Severe pain in left arm, from the shoulder to the elbow of left arm felt heavy and very painful for two days.  I started my menstrual cycle the day after the vaccination - two weeks early. I am on birth control and my dates have not varied in twenty years until this time. It has been an abnormally heavy cycle with very painful cramps this time too - things which I have not had since I was in my early twenties (and never since I have been on birth control).

A 46-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose at the age of 46-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included montelukast taken for hypersensitivity, start and stop date were not reported; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) taken for hypersensitivity, start and stop date were not reported; birth control pills and multivitamins. The patient reported that she got her first shot of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Mar2021 and since then she don&#39;t normally get my period because she continuously take her pills  and she have been bleeding ever since the next day and she found a lump on her collar bone, she found a marble sized lump on her collar bone that keeps moving around. The period started on 19Mar2021 still goin and it&#39;s way heavier than ever and she just noticed the little lump on her collar bone this morning. Her birth control was either Drospire /Ethestr /Lev tab (for further clarification) and she takes it one pill a day. She called her gynecologists yesterday since she was bleeding and they told her to stop taking it the birth control until Sunday and then restart it that&#39;s the only thing. She was still experiencing the event and it&#39;s 10 times worse than when she normally used to have periods. The patient did not recover from menstrual cycle abnormal and bleeding menstrual heavy while unknown for the other events.

She said she had just finished her menstrual cycle before receiving the first dose so shouldn&#39;t have had a cycle, and that also she was always very regular with her cycles prior to this.

                                                On 3/17/2021, I began to have a very heavy mentrual period and it was 5 days early (which never happens). On 3/22/21 I had a nose bleed at work, which also never happens. I got home from work at an RN and took off my compression stocking and had bad petechiae all over my lower extremities and scattered throughout my body. I immediately went to the Emergency Room. My labs at the ER showed my platelets were 2000! Normal platelets are over 150,000. They admitted my for thrombocytopenia and I was hospitalized for 12 nights. I was given platelets, high doses of prednisone, IVIG infusions 8 times, rituximab infusion 4 times, bone marrow biopsy which was negative, and nplate injections. Since discharge, I have been seeing the hematology team 3 times a week at facility, labs 3 times a week, rituximab infusion every friday, nplate injection once a week. I have not been able to work since 3/22/21. My diagnosis is an autoimmune response called idiopathic thrombocytopenia.

                                                Because I have endometrosis, I take my birth control continuously to suppress menstruation and have not had a period for years. I had my vaccine at 3:30pm (Thurs) and I was woken up in the middle of the night with my period starting. By day 3 (Saturday) I had a full, heavy period and horrible menstrual cramps and spent the entire day in bed under a heating blanket. My period lasted that whole week until the following Monday. I discussed this with my gynecologist and he said he has never heard of anyone having this happen from the vaccine and just assumed it was extremely coincidental.

Then Saturday started off feeling like a kidney infection. By Sunday I was feeling worse but quickly progressed to severe cramps that felt like with labor and chest pain. Felt like a heart attack with lightheaded ness, cold sweats and thought I was going to faint.

The groin one remains. Also noticing changes to menstrual cycle flow and it started earlier than normal this month.

                                                I am an extremely regular person when it comes to my period. It is 28 days, down to the hour. The period after my first dose was three days late. It was heavier than normal, and I had some severe body aches. When I got my second dose, I experienced fatigue and body aches for a few days after. For about 10 days before my period I experienced incredibly achey breasts (this usually happens just  1-2 days before, and medium ache). Just got my period this morning, 2 days early. My whole body is achy, and the flow is really heavy.

Usually I have flow for four days and it is never much. . I am getting a bit old : (:) ) but this would not be the first sign of menopause.  Won?t stop me from being an advocate but you need to research this....what would be the mechanism for this?  I will also tell my doctor.

This lasted for over an hour. Honestly I did not report it at the site because I needed to get back to work.  I did not seek medical attention because my legs started to feel normal after about an hour. Additionally my period that I had already started became heavier that usual.  Normally I only bleed large clots of blood for a few days but this time it lasted for 5 days, large clots the entire time. Approximately 8 hours after my injection, all of the muscles in my body felt very crampy and achy and I felt extremely tired. The next day my throat was sore and but the aches and muscle cramps had improved but were still there. It took several days until I felt myself again.

                                                The first shot in January gave me migraines on and off over the next 5 days, based on the left side of my head.  I usually get a migraine before my period, but always on my front right area behind my eye and above my ear, and only for 1 day. It was noticeable because they kept coming back and it was in a place I&#39;ve never had a migraine start.  The second shot however on 2/9/21 is my main concern. my period was just ending after about 4 days.  a bit of spotting, but it was basically done. The next day after my shot though, I woke up soaked in blood. I spent the next 7-8 hours going through 7 Super-size Tampax Tampons. It seemed like I was flash flooding blood  which was weird because ..well if my lining had just shed over the previous 7 days, where did all the blood come from? It ebbed within 24 hours and was back to normal the day after that before it ended.  Over by 2/12/21.  And now, it is 5/3/21 and I have not had a period since and have basically had early menopause jump in and get hot flashes every day! I read that its not actually menopause until our period has been gone for 6 months or more, and mine has really only been nearly 3, but I&#39;m pretty sure I just got sterilized.  And I was a healthcare worker so I got it early, and I don&#39;t think the older people getting the shot in line before me would have been raising the concern about their menses cycles because they don&#39;t have them anymore.

After receiving vaccine close to time I was due to ovulate, I did not receive a menstrual cycle for 76 days. When I did the cycle was 7 days longer. The next menstrual cycle began 20 days later.

                                                I had Covid 19 in January and noticed then that I got a second period that month while I was sick.  I got the 1st covid vaccine in April, after not having a period at all in March and then my period started after the shot and I just kept spotting for about 2 weeks.  I just  had the second vaccine 5/5/21 and now my period has started again very heavily, although it wasn&#39;t expected to start for yet.  Just wanted to add to the info/discussion about how covid and the vaccine seem to affect women&#39;s menstrual cycles.

                                                I menstruated a full week earlier than expected after having the second dose of the vaccine. (I have been like clockwork for years).   Both anemia and thrombocytopenia run in my family and I am going to follow up with my physician to see if bloodwork is recommended-- I don&#39;t think he will know the answer and would like assistance from CDC to understand any connection between vaccine and menstruation and the extent to which that suggests an issue with clotting or any other disorder.  I am happy to participate in any studies on this and am eager for follow up. I think the menstruation angle needs to be addressed to bolster public confidence-- am hearing reports of menstrual changes frequently. Thank you. Also noting that 14 year old daughter started spotting three days after receiving her first Pfizer vaccine.

                                                The first Dose was administered on March 31.  I started staining then bleeding several days after which is not normally a part of my menstrual cycle.  This continued for several days and times up until the second dose on April 21.  I started bleeding again on April 27 which was not my predicted normal menstrual start date. Immediately after the second dose on April 21st I had a sharp shooting pain in my neck and left arm.  I waited at the hospital for 30 minutes and no further reaction so I left.  On the car ride home I started to get a headache which has continued almost daily since that date.  I started to get a pin and needles sensation in my face and fingers about 1 hour after the dose which I assumed was a panic attack.  The pins and needles and then slight numbness continued on and off in my face, forearms, hands, fingers, knees, shins, feet, and toes.  Still experiencing this today (5/23/21).  At Approx 6:30pm on April 21st I began to feel very fatigued.  Head was pounding and I started to feel chills.  Head to toe Body aches shortly followed and then 101.6 fever kicked in.  Body aches and fever lasted for 2.5 days.   On April 23 my fever broke. Still in bed from April 21, I was then woken by severe stomach pains.  I started vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time.  This lasted a few hours. I lost 3 pounds in the first few days following my 2nd dose

                                                I missed my menstrual cycle for the months of April and May following the vaccines.  I took a pregnancy test which was negative.  I didn&#39;t think too much about it because I assumed maybe I was starting menopause early, but when I mentioned it to others, I was told missed periods are happening with the vaccines and I should report it.  I finally started my period yesterday (June 1st), lighter than usual, but 69 days since my previous period.

                                                On the day of the vaccine, I felt very tired, fever, muscle pains, headache,  and nausea. I did not take any medication.  I improved over 3 days and almost all gone away.   About a month after the vaccine, I found a lump in my right breast (self exam during shower).   It was bigger and painful.  I went to the doctor and referred to specialist.  I did a mamogram and ultrasound.  I had a 10cm area infected tissue as well as a cyst.  I was put on 2 rounds of antibiotics (the only one I can remember is Augmentin).   The infection was resolved after I finished the 2nd round of antibiotics (Augmentin) and the size of the cyst is decreasing.   As I was recovering from the breast cyst, I started to notice pain in my pelvic area.  I went to see NP/PCP and I had a CT scan which showed an ovarian cyst and was referred to a gynecologist.  I  did lab work and pelvic ultrasound.  Right now just monitoring the size and following up periodically.

No fertility treatments. Spontaneous pregnancy at 46 years old. Had 2 previous miscarriages - 6 months earlier and 3 years earlier. Started bleeding and cramping 05/26/2021. Went to emergency room. They checked with ultrasound and said it was probably a miscarriage. The baby should be 9 or 10 weeks, but the ultrasound showed it was much too small for that - probably stopped developing at about 6 weeks. Pregnancy hormone levels were normal, however. Followed up with OBGYN the next day - she confirmed it looked like a miscarriage. The cramping/bleeding lasted for another week. Follow-up appointment on 06/04/2021 showed the uterus had completely emptied.

I had multiple CBC tests performed during this period of time and my HGB levels plummeted from 12.6 on 4/13/2021 to 8.4 on 5/14/2021. RBC count went from 4.48 on 4/13/2021 to 3.10 on 5/14/2021. I experienced severe anemia, was incredibly weak, missed multiple days of work, and required surgery to finally stop the bleeding.

She was not tested but had antibodies. She had COVID then and then she tested positive for antibodies before getting the vaccine), hypersensitivity from an unspecified date in Feb2021 (The only time she did not feel well was with allergy symptoms, around mid Feb2021, around 15Feb2021). Concomitant medications included estradiol at a dose of two times daily (0.5pr, 30mg, one click, twice a day) taken for hormone therapy and testosterone cream daily (2% cream, MWF, 2 clicks per day) taken for hormone therapy.

She said it was not like it has only been a couple years, she said she normally does not bleed. Patient contacted the doctor when she had spotting. She was having sex and did not really associate it with the vaccine because she had her shot in the arm and didn&#39;t have many symptoms from it. It has been a while since her last period. She used to have lighter periods she was not a heavy bleeder but with this she had super tampons in and pads and went through them in an hour, intermittently. It was a lot of blood. Patient spoke with her gynecologist who sent her to get an ultrasound because she said she should not be bleeding so she wanted to rule out cancer. The ultrasound was on 06May2021 and was normal. The doctor gave her 5mg norethindrone to take every night. It was given to stop the bleeding; it was 5 tablets one every night. She took it from the 06May2021 to the 10May2021 and her doctor said it should stop within a couple days, but it took longer, it stopped on 10May2021. Then it started again and bled from 13May2021 to 17May2021. After 17May2021, there was no more bleeding. Is pretty sure it was 17May2021, was roughly around that time.

All of this is highly abnormal for my cycles and disturbing to me because the only variable was getting the vaccine while on my period.

                                                I experienced two adverse events after receiving the vaccine. My first adverse event was that I had a 10 day cycle at which I lost over 40 ml of blood per hour. I was put on birth control to regulate the bleeding. My second adverse event was that my doctor told me to get a mammogram, and the day I was going to schedule the appointment, I found a lump on my breast. I went to the doctor on 06/25 and he thought I had mrsa. It turned out to be a bacterial infection ,that was not mrsa, in my breast. I was put on antibiotics and he drained it.

I am never late and this period was very heavy and bad cramps.   Im believing this was due to the vaccine as this was the only thing that changed in my life. (I also took a pregnancy test to ensure I wasn?t having a miscarriage, test was negative).   Wanted to report this as  a possible side effect (as I researched and do see some others had changes in their period post vaccine around 1%).

                                                After my first vaccine, I developed an axillary lymph node to my left arm which was painful; it felt like it was ripping out of my left arm and it was tender. The lymph node subsided after two days of the vaccination. I also had two menstrual cycles back to back which was out of the ordinary for me since I am regular on my periods.  I saw my gynecologist due to my menstrual symptoms. I was regular up to that point of my vaccination. One week ago I had better range of motion to my left arm.

                                                My otherwise normal hormonal cycle has been completely disrupted.  After the first vaccine shot on March 4th, I had irregular bleeding following my period, but not heavy and because it was super light, I considered it unnoticed.  However, after the second vaccine on March 25, I had heavier cramping exactly during the time I would normally have my period, but no period came.  I am now 6 days late, which has never happened to me.  I had all of the cramping and symptoms of a timely cycle, but no period at all!  My cycle is normal, if not a day early.  Never late.  Additionally, the day after the shot, I had an enlarged lymph node under my arm pit for a few days that moved to a sensitive breast.   Something is definitely wrong.

                                                Have had my menstrual cycle of heavy bleeding for 12 days, I was on my 4 day of a normal cycle (the day before it was supposed to end) when flow started back up  heavier then I have experienced in over 20 years.   I am still bleeding so heavily that I am unable to wear a tampon, and have to wake in the middle of the night to change an overnight pad because the feel of bleeding has woke me up.  Went to ER last night, had blood tests as well a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound to rule out fibroid or any type of abnormalities that would cause it. Everything came back with no explanation and now I have to take a hormone, medroxyprogesterone 10mg for the next 10 days in hopes of stopping the flow.

At the time I chalked it up to pre menapausal symptoms . But it was definitely out of the norm.   If I go back to 30 days normal cycle I?ll be more convinced it was due to vaccine.

                                                Lumps in my left breast became suddenly swollen, hard and painful. The pain extended to my arm pit.  The swelling of the breast was pronounced enough that the entire left breast was visibly larger than the right breast. The swelling took a week to subside, but has not gone. The pain subsided in a week, but remains as I fill in this form.  The pain is in both the breast and the arm pit of the left side.

This was significantly more painful and heavy than any menstruation of my entire life. I was doubled over in pain crying for days. Took Advil to reduce pain.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer (the patient) reported that a 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Apr2021 17:00 at age of 47-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), collagen, biotin, curcuma longa (TURMERIC), aloe vera, malus domestica (VINEGAR APPLE CIDER PLUS), and all of the natural vitamins. The patient took these every singe day. She was taking all the above vitamins because she was 47 years old and she wanted her skin different and she wanted to prevent the COVID. She had oil essence that she put on every single day and she had for more than one year it was the essential oil that she put in her diffuser with water and it was to prevent sickness. None prior vaccination within 4 weeks prior. Relevant Family History related to AE(S) was none. The patient received her 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02Apr2021. She received a positive COVID test result on 04Apr2021. After 10-11 days she felt really good, she had only mild symptoms. She just had one or two days of body aches and that&#39;s it. 2nd dose was due 23Apr2021. The patient said she did not get COVID from the vaccine but was positive because of her husband who has allergies and cough every day of the year. He caught COVID at the restaurant (One family had invited them to go to a restaurant with them and inside the restaurant it was crazy. There were more than 80 people in there and that&#39;s it, after that her husband got the positive COVID test and then her daughter and then finally her), but they did not know because the symptoms were exactly the same as his pollen allergy. When she had the vaccine she had COVID in her body already. The only thing that she felt after the vaccine was a little cold (Apr2021), but the weather in the city was crazy, the temperature was around 50 and she said &#34;oh perfect,&#34; she was going to get a cold after the vaccine. She thought that it wasn&#39;t the vaccine that caused it, she caught a cold because suddenly the weather was around 50 and she told her daughter that she needed a sweater and she gave her sweater to her daughter and she thought that she got a cold, but that was the only thing she felt. Another thing, when they put the vaccine in the area where she got the vaccine it was a little pain after the vaccine and she could feel it in her muscle. That was the only thing. It was muscle pain but only a little one. She thinks that began around the second day, 03Apr2021. She confirmed that she has recovered completely and added that currently she felt perfect. Caller said that she didn&#39;t remember when her muscle pain ended, it disappeared. The person that is with the department of health said that the caller didn&#39;t need to repeat her COVID test but she said that she was going to repeat her test because she wanted a negative test result. The person she spoke to said to wait 19 days to do the test because she can get positive results and then after 10 days she would not be contagious anymore. She would be able to walk outside of her house because she would not be contagious but the caller said that she wanted to wait until she got a negative result because COVID had got all of her family, her little one, her husband and her. The person that entered the COVID virus in her house was her husband. But she was confused because every single day of his life he has a cough. She thought the pollen was heavy outside and he coughed from that and then the same day they she the vaccine they had the same appointment. She told her husband to go to the doctor and asked if he can still have the vaccine and see if he has allergies so hard and that is it. He wasn&#39;t having allergies, it was COVID. Probed if the caller&#39;s husband had the COVID vaccine the same day that she did and she said that her husband had cancelled his appointment. The only person that has received the COVID vaccine that day was her because she thought that she just had the same allergy that he was having. She felt something about two days ago and said &#34;what?&#34; but she had to attend to everyone in the house and honestly she didn&#39;t have enough. Just had one or two days of body aches: She got her vaccine Friday, 02Apr2021, she had the positive result on Sunday, 04Apr2021, but that Friday night, 02Apr2021, she had body aches in her legs only but she walked a lot. She felt tired and her legs had muscle pain (onset date unknown). She felt tired currently and that was the only thing. What she had wasn&#39;t chills, but it was weird she has never felt that kind of chill before, it was inside the muscles. It was weird. It was different. The next day she called the doctor and he told her that she was positive for COVID and then her symptoms started the night before that and he said to take some medicine and that is it. She took it and the second day she was perfect. Caller confirmed that it was either Tuesday, 06Apr2021, or Wednesday, 07Apr2021, that she felt better. She confirmed that she has recovered completely from the body aches. She cough likes (she gave an example of the cough) and that is it. Probed if she still has the cough currently and she said that she did not have it at the date of report. The only thing was that if she had to clean the house or exercise, she can feel a little bit tired and then she has to rest. No further details provided. The only thing was the day she got the first symptom her period appeared and it was different because she had a lot of pain and in all of her life she has never gotten pain. She had a lot, a lot of pain in her pelvic area and it was in the coccyx area. It was a discomfort pain, it was weird. The first day of the period with the pain was 08Apr2021. Probed for how long she had the pain and she said it was the day before her period, the day of her period and then it disappeared the next day. It was really weird pain but she supposed it was because she had COVID. Confirmed began on 07Apr2021 and it went away on 09Apr2021 which was the day after. She has recovered completely. She had a COVID test on 04Apr2021 and had a repeat test on 05Apr2021 and both were positive. Someone said to repeat the test because she had the vaccine on that Friday and maybe she had a false positive and she thought about how her daughter didn&#39;t get the COVID vaccine and she was positive so the caller thought that she has to be positive too. And that is it, she repeated it at the convention center and she received the positive result again. Someone said that she needed to retest in 19 days, she asked if it was correct. For question if any AE(s) require a visit to: emergency room or physician office, the patient said yes (as reported), she had an over the phone appointment with her doctor because she got the positive COVID result and she wanted to ask him about what happened to her body. She had the vaccine and then had COVID with no symptoms inside her body. She said what happened? And someone she spoke to said that she would have to call her doctor because they didn&#39;t know. Nothing happened and the doctor said that she could get COVID without the vaccine because she didn&#39;t have enough time to protect her body. If she had gotten COVID after the vaccine, about 10 days then she would feel less. The outcome of events &#34;a little pain after the vaccine and she could feel it in her muscle/her legs had muscle pain&#34;, &#34;just had one or two days of body aches/body aches in her legs only&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, &#34;her period appeared and it was different because she had a lot of pain and in all of her life she has never gotten pain&#34;, &#34;pain in her pelvic area and it was in the coccyx area&#34;, &#34; was recovered on 09Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                I felt light headed shortly after leaving or within the 1/2 hour after vaccine. Later that evening i had a migraine. The following day another migraine. It went away and Monday it returned.  I began taking Aleve and it eventually stopped. The Thursday after vaccination (4/15/21) i woke up full of blood like a period however it was not time for my period and the bleeding went away early that morning. Every other day after that i was getting spotting and i am still getting it.  At the same time the bleeding started, i was having knots in my stomach that made me have multiple bowel movements daily. Every thing i ate would send me to the bathroom a few hours later.   I have chronic constipation and have bowel movements usually 2-3 times a week but this vaccine had me going 2- 3 times a day . This lasted from until a day before i was due for my 2nd vaccine. I had the second dose 4/30/2021 and had no issues until today when the stomach knots and multiple bowel movements resumed. I am hoping it&#39;s going to pass quickly since i had no issues from the second dose. It was the first dose that was awful for me

Lots of pain and cramping. Either very early miscarriage or abnormal and unexpected menstrual cycle. Never otherwise have any pain or issues and always have regular cycle. Same exact thing occurred after second shot which is why I?m now connecting the dots and reporting this.

Not normal for her-Severe, Additional Details: Pt had to get a Toradol shot for a migraine in the left arm 6-7 days after the shot in the left arm that was vaccinated. She ended up getting a red , ropey looking line starting from the injection site up her arm that also had knodules going up that line as well. So she thinks that the heavy period with a lot of clots was caused by the injection and that the phlebitis of the left arm was possibly from the shot as well because she has had other IVs in her arms before that did not cause reaction

It was so bad I couldnt walk.   The pain would subside and then I would bleed alot.    Then the pain would start again.  The pain would subside and I would start bleeding alot again.   This was like labor.  Wednesday I had a lot of tissue come out of me so I realized this must be a miscarriage.   My doctor told me to take a pregnancy test and sure enough it tested positive  I was about 5- 7 weeks pregnant. As far as pregnancy history, I also miscarried February 11th.  (went in for the ultrasound and fetus wasnt moving around 9 weeks).   Had first child at 35 and 2nd at 40.   My instincts tell me the vaccine had something to do with  my 2nd miscarriage (April 5th).

                                                Day after vaccination, I had a fever of 101.7 and chills. I expected those.  About 3 days after vaccination I started experiencing joint  pain. At first I thought maybe it was just that I had made myself sore with physical activity, but the joint pain has never completely resolved and is something that I have never experienced before. I am a veterinarian, and the symptoms that I am experiencing are consistent with a poly arthritis. The pain reduces with a anti-inflammatory but never goes away completely. Also I am experiencing joint swelling and fluid accumulation, I have never had such symptoms before. I other effect, my menstrual period was over 3 weeks late. I realize that I am of an age that menopause could start, but I had been extremely regular up to that point, had not had intercourse in over 1 year, and my family history is that of women who go into menopause in their early 50&#39;s.

About two weeks after vaccine had night sweats for a week and then started my menses on day 19 in my cycle which has never happened. Also got a yeast infection- haven?t had one of these in many years.  I have also randomly gained 10 lbs- I?m guessing due to something with my estrogen. I have also been extremely depleted feeling since the second vaccine, I?m used to low energy but this depletion has been more than normal for me. This second menstral  cycle that I?m getting ready for seems like I will start late.

                                                Later that afternoon I felt like a ton of bricks hit me. Almost like I was going to faint. When I got home my arm was swollen and red. I started having a bad bowel movement, no fever, stiffness, joints aching, and dull aches. I had a hard time resting. The next day when I woke up, I had a bowel movement bad. When I went downstairs, I was bleeding from light to medium from my vagina. For 4 hours I had sharp pains in the middle of my chest. I went to see Doctor; my symptoms were gone for 5 days. Then 10 days ago my eyes were tearing a lot and painful. I went walking and had incredible pain in feet, ankle, knee, and I could barely stand. The next morning, I went to my PCP and referred me to a RA doctor and think it&#39;s an autoimmune disease.

                                                Dizziness started 1/15/21.  My first menstrual cycle starting 2/4 produced extremely heavy clotting and bleeding, unlike nothing I have ever experienced in the past.  It reminded me of when I miscarried, the clotting was so bad.  Tampons were soaked in &lt;4hrs which I have also never experienced with any menstrual cycle in my life.  The heavy menstrual cycle continued the next month (March).  I started taking a baby aspirin shortly after the most recent menstrual cycle.  Symptoms have improved in April, May and June, but still continue.

This month it lasted 4 days and was very very light.

On June 4,2021 10 days after my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I began to have post menopausal bleeding for nine days. It stopped on June 10, 2021. I was clotting during that period as well. I?ve since had a vaginal ultrasound and pelvic MRI with no signs of cancer or anything else that would cause post menopausal bleeding.

She also had bilateral nipple tenderness and severe left breast tenderness to the point where she needed to take Motrin. She also had what felt like menstrual cramps. The most significant symptoms lasted about 10 days, but are persisting at a lower level. She saw her GYN for a routine appointment and the GYN found masses in both breasts, more noticeable in the left, and uterine pain during the pelvic exam.

                                                Within a short time after receiving my COVID vaccination, I experienced a burst of energy, pretty severe abdominal cramping, and vaginal bleeding (small amount; very close location-wise to being internal but was external). Bleeding lasted until bedtime and was gone, along with the abdominal cramping and burst of energy by the next morning and has never returned.  Vaccine #2 was on 2/9/21 and the only difference I felt after that one was tiredness; took a 3 hour nap shortly after I returned home and never noticed anything else since.  (Not sure if this helps to know...I had a hysterectomy mid-October, 2020.)

I experienced the expected fatigue, sore arm and axillary lymph node swelling (12 days post vaccination).

After one day of light flow, I had 2 days of heavy flow, where I always have one. I hardly ever have cramping, if I do, it is once or twice, followed by bleeding. In this case, I had cramping throughout two days, and the second day, the cramping took a long time to lead to bleeding, and the bleeding was like nothing I have had. Had headache, where I usually do not have one, several times. Then I had 6 days of light flow, totaling 9 days of bleeding, Had a lot of Dizziness (have history of anemia, so wondered if it was this, but I had it more often than usual).

A 48-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient started a light period on Sunday which continued for 5 days. She had a Mirena IUD for almost 7 years (second one inserted 2 years ago). She don&#39;t have a period with Mirena; every couple months she will spot for a day but it does not require a tampon. However, the day after her injection she had light bleeding on 28Mar2021 for 5 days which required light tampons to control so it didn&#39;t ruin her clothes. Treatment was not received for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered. Event was reported as non-serious.

I also experienced severe fatigue that continues more than a month later.

                                                I have not a menstrual cycle since receiving my 2nd shot.  It&#39;s now been 2 months since my last cycle.  Yet I am symptomatic of a cycle (cramping, bloating) but the menses do not come.  While I am 48, I have been regular and consistent with my periods up until the 2nd shot and have never been this late (not pregnant, did an OTC test to be extra sure).  A similar case is being reported by colleague of mine.  Same age, same shot, same week and yet no cycle has come yet for her since the 2nd shot.  Given that it&#39;s both of us in the same boat, it&#39;s more than coincidence and more than &#34;perimenopause&#34; - what is the likely hood we both went into a weird peri-cycle the month we received the shot?

                                                Have only had sporadic spotting for a year. The day following my second dose, I started my period. It was manageable for 8 days then got extremely heavy and painful. Still spotting and this is the 16th day.

                                                1st vaccine dose on Wed 2/10/21 I had no symptoms except my next period started one week late.  I was on the 4th day of my period when I got my second dose on Tue 3/9/21.  I thought I had no symptoms except a sore arm from the shot.  My period lasted 14 days - heavy flow throughout w some discomfort.  I assumed it was over and was surprised when 6 days later I started my period again for 8 days w a heavy flow throughout w some discomfort.  I thought that was the end then 18 days later I started my period again for 8 days.  Not as heavy but heavier than usual.  Hopefully it is weening back to my normal cycle.  I can&#39;t afford to go to a doctor unless its an emergency - so I&#39;m just dealing with it.

Lasted 4 days, then stopped for 1 week and then started very heavy again. I?ve never had this much bleeding or this frequent of periods together. This is a first and there is no other change to my days, routines, stress etc than the covid shot. I?m a huge vaccine advocate but this very heavy bleeding is not normal for me.

This pain hurt when touching, pressing or  lifting arm and breast tenderness. Blood pressure extremely high the week following vaccine which was first noticed on 3/14, as high as 140/90.  Prior to vaccine blood pressure was controlled with diet.  I saw Dr. on 3/20 because blood pressure readings were inconsistent.  Doctor checked me and wanted to monitor pressure readings for a while.  Did not prescribe medication because the blood pressure readings were inconsistent.  Scheduled an appointment me to return in a month. However, on  3/21 I started experiencing heart palpitations and 3/22  heart palpitations, shortness of breath and tightness in chest and throat. I went to the ENT who determined the I had acid reflux and advised that I should return to primary care Dr. to make sure that everything was okay with my heart.  I saw doctor again and the following test (acceptable) were conducted.

                                                Extremely heavy period.  Haven?t had one in 18 months due to pregnancy and breastfeeding.   This is my 4th child and I never have a period while breastfeeding.    This period was non stop bleeding for more than 24 hours.   Bright red which is unusual because it shouldn?t be fresh blood since it?s been 18 months.  Happened almost 2 weeks after second shot.   I also had a lot of post vaccine symptoms after second shot which include fever, chills, aches and breathing issues. Those lasted a week.   Tested for coronavirus during that timeframe and was negative.  Still bleeding, on 3rd  day, still bright red but not gushing like it was.

On 16APR2021 patient received her second dose of vaccine and had typical effects 24-48 hours later including fever (Apr2021), soreness of the arm (Apr2021), fatigue, a dull headache, menstrual cramps, and blue bruising to her right foot, which is a little bit unusual. She also added that she was menopausal, and she had very severe menstrual cramps. However, all of that passed, except for the really dull headache and fatigue, which had lasted pretty much a whole week. The headache and fatigue are just not dissipating. With the fatigue, she can barely keep her eyes open. She&#39;s barely been functioning this week because of it. She stated that she knew that these symptoms were pretty normal within the first 48 hours but she was almost a week in and she was still having some of these symptoms. Patient had cramping in her hands and feet, which started at the night of the vaccine on 16Apr2021. It almost felt like dehydration cramps that one has in their feet, hands/palms, muscles- she clarified that further like sporting dehydration cramps. Within the 48-hour time period after the shot, she had menstrual cramps. She thought that was unusual since she no longer has her period anymore. However, all of these symptoms besides the dull headache and fatigue went away- those were all within 48 hours. The only thing that was really unusual to her was the cramping of her hands and feet, the bruising of her feet, plus the menstrual cramps. The other side effects seemed to be aligned with what they said the expected side effects are. However, now the only thing that has lasted is just this dull headache. She does not generally suffer from headaches. The menstrual cramps appeared 2 days after receiving the vaccine, on Sunday 18Ap2021. There was a 2 hour period where she had the cramps and then they disappeared. She went into menopause last year so she hasn&#39;t had a period in a year or since being in menopause, so it was odd to suddenly have menstrual cramps. The fatigue started on Saturday, 17Apr2021. She explains Saturday, the fatigue was the worst. She clarifies all of the symptoms were the worse on Saturday, 17Apr2021. The fatigue was just ongoing. She normally does not ever take naps during the day but yesterday, she had to sleep 5 hours in the middle of the day because she was so exhausted. It was just like she can&#39;t even keep her eyes open, and she just has to go lie down. She had to stop what she is doing and go to sleep. She clarified that every day since she received the injection, she had to sleep/go lay down and nap in the afternoon because her eyes are physically closing. Patient confirms that the headaches started on Saturday, 17Apr2021. She explained that it was a dull headache that goes all the way across her brow. These headaches were still ongoing. It was not like a migraine and it was just a persistent headache and there all day long. She doesn&#39;t usually suffer from headaches ever, it&#39;s discombobulating, it&#39;s just a dull pain that will not go away. The outcome of the event was recovered on 18Apr2021 for Menstrual cramps; not recovered for Headache dull, fatigue and was unknown for other events.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 48-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: Er8735), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 27Apr2021 at 12:45 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 in Dec2020 and was sick for 4 months, neutropenia, allergy to latex; until the virus in Dec2020, the patient would hemorrhage no less than 3 weeks and spotted always for 4 months since COVID-19. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL), ibuprofen (ADVIL 12 HOUR) and ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (PORTIA 21). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: Er8732) on 31Mar2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 48-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and felt a little yucky. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) and experienced allergies. On 29Apr2021 at 10:00 (also reported as 48 hours after the 2nd vaccination), the patient started gushing hemorrhaging female-wise. She described this as bleeding through her pads. Within a week in May2021, (also reported as a few days later), the patient experienced malaise, extreme nausea, throbbing of her arms and legs, and dizziness laying down. She said she felt really bad. She said she was rushed to the emergency room on 03May2021, and then again on 06May2021. The patient also reported feeling sick with fevers as of 04May2021 (also reported that she doesn&#39;t know when it started or ended) after the hospital, she was not able to make sense now. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days as of 06May2021 and was considering going back as she was feeling worse. At the hospital, the patient received fluids and antibiotics. The patient was treated with a supplement to slow the blood flow. She did not know if it was improving, persistent or worsening. For 3 days she could not take the supplement but started to bleed more yesterday (probably because she didn&#39;t take the supplement). Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcome of &#34;she started hemorrhaging female wise&#34;, malaise, extreme nausea, throbbing of her arms and legs, dizziness, feeling sick and fever was not resolved.

A 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number: EN6205, and expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the upper left arm on 03Mar2021 12:00 (at the age of 48-years-old), as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing thyroid disorder (thyroid) and ongoing seizure. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) 200 micrograms once daily, taken for thyroid disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing (reported as roughly 6-8 months ago); and levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1500 mg twice daily, taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing (reported as roughly 6-8 months ago). The patient did not received any other vaccines on the day of vaccination and within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not had a menstrual cycle or period since Jul2020, but about 1 hour after vaccine was administered, menstrual cycle or period started with a vengeance and has worsened since then on 03Mar2021 13:00. Patient also had onset of headache where her head was pounding and feels like it is going to explode during call on 04Mar2021 (reported time of call was between 13:31 and 13:49). Patient asked if this event or a lot of events have been reported with the vaccine. At time of report, it was unknown if patient will or will not get second dose as scheduled. Patient did not consult physician nor urgent care for the events reported. Patient was not hospitalized as a result of the events. The outcome of menstrual disorder was not recovered and headache was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

It was pretty normal stuff, then the breakthrough bleeding happened. The neck pain, pain in arm, and nausea started the next day after receiving the vaccine and lasted like 24 hours. Caller stated just out of curiosity, has anyone else had this issue. She was not asking for people personally if it is a side effect, but she believed everyone should be told about if this was one of the side effects. She wants to know if this had a side effect of the Covid vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events, patient took Advil. The outcome for event within a week after this she started her period. she states she just finished her period prior to this and is on birth control so her cycle is very regular and stiff neck was unknown, while the outcome for pain in arm, neck pain and nausea were recovered on 27May2021.

She was talking to 2 girls in her office who also just had the second Pfizer Covid vaccine and are having extended menstrual bleeding. They are not having it to the extent she was, they are just having spotting. Patient was 48 years old, and since she has been a teen about 7 days, she was normally like clockwork. Today was day 14 of her menstrual cycle, after second. Since the beginning of her period, she has been doubling overnight pads and they are saturated. Within 48 hours she went through 2 bags of pads. She went to ER on Tuesday night because she was bleeding so bad. Right now, she was on her way to the OBGYN now because they said she needed to follow up. They gave her Progesterone to slow the bleeding, but it was not a long-term fix. She does not have an NDC, lot, or expiration date for the Progesterone available. She went to the ER and had the tests on Tuesday. Patient was not hospitalized due to event caused. Lab tests included she had bloodwork done, but it was not related to this. When she went to the hospital, they did prick on her finger to test her haemoglobin levels which were okay. They did a pelvis ultrasound to make sure she had no fibroid or other issues, and she didn&#39;t have. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  PC filed.  Description of complaint: While reporting an AE on the COVID Vaccine, patient mentioned that her OBGYN gave her Progesterone to slow the bleeding during an extended menstrual cycle, but she was still experiencing heavy bleeding. She does not have an NDC, lot, or expiration date for the Progesterone available. No Product strength and count size  was dispensed. No Additional lot numbers. PC identified after the call. Additional details unable to be obtained.

I also had a debilitating headache for 3 weeks and the inflammation in my body was astronomical. I&#39;m still suffering from inflammation and quite uncomfortable at times. I had an irregular heartbeat for several weeks. Also the vaccine brought me out of menopause. I had my period every two weeks (3 times). And now my periods are back and longer than they were before. My asthma is at its worst because of the inflammation. I am uncomfortable on a daily basis because of the anxiety that has come with this shot that will not go away. It is a daily occurrence.

                                                My biggest complaint is that I am now  66 days out from the first shot and no period. I did get sick from both the first and second shot (sore arm, fevers, fatigue, unable to function - especially on the second shot). But I should have had a period between the 1st and the 2nd - and there was nothing. I finally had some spotting last week. But still literally nothing. This is really frustrating and frankly scary.

The patient was originally admitted on 5/22 for evaluation of bizarre behavior. She was noted to have flight of ideas, emotional instability and multiple attempts to leave the room naked. She was admitted to the floor there with behavioral health consulted for evaluation. She was then transferred to another  unit on 5/27/21 for additional management, with a plan for a 90 day inpatient hold.  While in the unit she was managed with a medication regimen including Thorazine, Lithium and Abilify.  Medicine was consulted for management of hypertension, and Ob-Gyn was following for abnormal vaginal bleeding with work-up unable to be completed due to her mental status.  ECT treatments were also started this week on 6/23, with the patient receiving her second ECT treatment this afternoon.  From review of the pre-procedure note, the planned induction was with etomidate, succinylcholine, glycopyrrolate, and Brevitol (methohexital, barbiturate class); the actual MAR is not up to date with her procedural medications at the time of admission.  Post treatment, the patient was noted to be conversive and in her normal state of health.  This evening, nursing staff heard a loud noise from the patient&#39;s room around 1630. Upon arrival, they found her down, unresponsive and without a pulse. An ACT was called  and CPR was initiated for a duration of approximately 30 minutes. Reportedly the AED display showed asystole, followed by PEA.  She received a reported five rounds of epinephrine, one dose of bicarbonate, and one dose of calcium during the event.  The patient was intubated during the code with a large amount of gastric contents present, concerning for aspiration.  A right ankle IO was placed due to significant difficulty securing access elsewhere.  ROSC was obtained with a junctional rhythm, and the patient was transferred for further management.      On arrival the patient is non-responsive without any sedation running.  She became hypotensive by arrival to the ICU requiring norepinephrine.  On later inspection of her IO, there was suspicion for infiltration of fluids and medications around her right ankle.  She has had significant secretions into her ETT since transfer.   HPI as noted above.  ICU course notable for hypoxic respiratory failure with ARDS likely from lung injury from cardiac arrest.  She subsequently developed shock and required vasopressors.  Initially the patient was noted to have brainstem reflexes, however on 6/25 the patient had an exam change with no spontaneous breaths and pupils fixed and dilated.  The initial head CT following arrest was performed which showed diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of the sulci and gray and white matter differentiation consistent with severe anoxic brain injury. There was diminished ventricular size with complete effacement of the fourth ventricle and tonsillar herniation from mass effect.  Neurology was consulted.     The patient remained on vasopressor and mechanical ventilator support. A NM scan was performed to evaluate cerebral blood flow showed absence of effective cerebral perfusion.  Neurology performed an exam and the patient was pronounced deceased at 1802 on 6/27/21 a doctor.   The family was informed of the results. After discussion with family, the patient was removed from mechanical ventilator support and vasoactive medications discontinued with the family at beside.

                                                Fever, chills, severe headache and joint pain. Felt tired and fatigued. This occurred after both injections but was considerably worse after the second.  Headache has continued to be constant since the vaccine. I have also experienced heavy periods, and horrible cramps. Before the vaccine I almost had no period whatsoever. I didn?t have cramps at all. In my 20s I did have cramps and heavier periods. Since the vaccine the cramps have been so bad they wake me up at night. I also am experiencing a lot of bleeding for a longer duration. This is absolutely abnormal for me. I had an ablation three years ago so seldom had any period. If I did it would be very light brown spotting. Not enough to even wear a pad. So, this is highly unusual.

I equate the swelling and discomfort to the same feeling I had when pregnant or nursing.  Then on Sunday,  April 18th, the tenderness  started in my left  armpit.  I am  currently still experiencing these symptoms.  I had a normal  mammogram  last  June and  I do not feel  any lumps or nodules.

My period has been very watery, which is very unusual. I was bleeding through my clothes, even though I had a thick pad on and changing my pad hourly. I had to also use a thick washcloth and a pad, and I will still bleeding through my pants. When I would stand up after urinating, blood will just flow out of me like I was urinating, but it was definitely from my period. I was very concerned about the amount of blood I was shedding, but it was very watery.  I&#39;ve had three babies, and I have never had a period I ever had before. It is day seven, and I am still on my period. Usually  my period lasts four days.

Repeat of the first period--heavy and long. As of May 2nd, I&#39;m still on my period.

However, some time after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine , I experienced familiar symptoms of ovulation and PMS (tender breasts, vaginal discharge, and cramping).  Then on May 8, 2021 (approx 2 weeks after receiving my second dose of the vaccine), I began menstruating heavily. Very heavily. On May 9 and 10, I continued to menstruate heavily. And, at the time of this writing (May 11), I continue to menstruate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 26Mar2021 at the age of 49-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no medical history and had no known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medication included ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported (medication in 2 weeks). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), administered in the left arm on 05Mar2021 at 10:00 AM at the age of 49-years-old for COVID-19 immunization. On 09Apr2021, the patient got her period 2 weeks early and she was bleeding very heavy and passing clots about 3 inches around in size. This has never happened to her in her life. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

I have never had an irregular period in my life, not ever and I started my period nearly 2 weeks early and it was heavy and bright red. It only lasted a few days but I am sure it has everything to do with the vaccine.

Please note that this was not like a regular menstrual period and I was not due for my period. I also bled after my first Pfizer vaccine but it was not alarmingly heavy like it was after this second dose. After this second vaccine dose, I was fatigued during the bleeding and after. The fatigue was resolved two weeks after I received the second vaccine. One other strange side effect was that three days after I received the second vaccine my left hand was slow to respond when I needed to type on the computer. This lasted for several days.

(I wouldn&#39;t have related this event to these shots but then saw a BBC article about this affect on women.)

                                                Felt mild nauseas and body/joint ache and fatigue within a few hours.  By next day more increased. By evening moderate. During sleep my body became drenched in sweat. Saturated sheets above and below my body as well as my clothing.  Strong body pain and joint pain, headache. Chills that shook me . Insomnia, heightened anxiety, pressure in my chest.   This lasted through the night. By next morning the severity was gone. For the following week fatigue joint/body pain remained.  The day of the vaccine I began to bleed but I had my menstrual  cycle complete the week prior to vaccine. I had an  intense experience with heavy blood clotting, heavy bleeding ( bleeding through super tampon inside 30 minutes ) this lasted for several hours, the intense bleeding. I continued to bleed for over a week, have deep fatigue and not feel like myself.   Upon my second vaccine my symptoms began almost immediately with headache,  body pain, joint pain and deep fatigue. I did not experience the severe symptoms during sleep however. I did begin to have my me atrial cycle again at the wrong time. And the bleeding still continues as well as an overall not feeling well. Fatigue, nervous system seems off.   I am a cery healthy person. I do not drink alcohol, soda, or use drugs. I am gluten free, limited dairy, limited animal protein.  I do have family history of inflammation and avoid foods that trigger this.

It is unrelated to activity or clothing. Does not limit my activities - just a weird, dull ache in the muscle of my right quad.

                                                On March 23, 2021, I began having an extremely heavy menstrual flow, passing clots and requiring protection to be changed at least hourly which lasted approximately three weeks.  There has been no period since that time.  Previous periods were irregular presumably related to peri-menopause, but were never heavy enough to change protection more often than every 4-5 hours and never lasted longer that 4-5 days.

                                                I took the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 5/4/2021. On 5/5/2021, I began experiencing shortness of breath, my chest was very tight, and I felt like someone was sitting on my chest. I felt like I was having an out of body experience and didn?t feel well. This continued until  5/14/2021 and seemed to resolve, but returned with a vengeance on 5/21/2021. The shortness of breath was much much worse and so was the tightness and pressure in my chest. I also had ringing in my ears. The day I took the vaccine (on 5/4/2021), my period had started, but stopped that day and didn?t return until 28 days later. I saw my doctor and he ordered an EEG and a stress echo test. The EEG returned normal, but I am waiting to go in for the stress echo test. I do not plan on taking the second dose because I?m very afraid of what might happen to me if I do. I am in excellent health and do not suffer from allergies. These side effects were awful! I didn?t start feeling better until  the first week of June. I don?t know if these symptoms will return. I still have ringing in my ears that comes and goes.

On the 3rd of May I phoned the DR and they gave me Tranexamic acid tablets. I took that for several days until the symptoms subsided. I did have this happen seven years ago and had to get blood transfusions. This time, it started on that Sunday night and had resolved by Thursday.

I also had abdomen upset, diarrhea, tired and generally felt unwell. I had diarrhea for a few days then it changed to loose stool for 1 week.   My joints started to hurt (hands and feet) which lasted for couples of weeks on and off.  A few days after, about 3 week after vaccine,  I had a persistent pain in my abdomen under the right rib cage.  I felt extremely fatigued and 1 night I would have chills (no fever).   I also had  a very heavy menstrual period on 3/3/2021. After that I have not had a period since for 3 months.   On 3/19/2021 I had a routine mammogram and ECHO since  my breast was still swollen. Results were inconclusive.  I got a covid test on 3/26/2021- negative.  I saw the NP on 4/5/2021 and did bloodwork (came back normal) and ultrasound of the liver (showed fatty liver infiltration) and I was referred to surgeon. I went to the surgeon, who concluded I may be having a viral infection or steato-hepatitis . I was prescribed Ursodil to help with the thinning of the bile in the liver, which has helped with relieving my abdominal pain.  I am currently still very fatigued (not normal for me)  and have not fully recovered.  I have an appt with GI for colonoscopy and endoscopy.

A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. Caller received her 1st Pfizer vaccine dose on 21 and she received her 2nd Vaccine dose on 16Apr2021. Caller states her menstrual cycle started the beginning of March/2021 and &#34;then my cycle started the very next day right after I received the 1st vaccine dose. So, I had 2 menstrual cycles in March and none in April. Caller states she knows she is at the age for &#34;menopause&#34; but did not think it would happen this quickly. The outcome of the event was unknown. Follow-up needed. Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

On March 4th I had my 6-week ultrasound and one embryo had implanted but did not survive and the 2nd was clearly not strong, smaller than it should have been with a fetal heartbeat only visible, not audible yet.  A week later, on March 11th, the ultrasound showed only empty gestational sacs and I had miscarried both.

However, this morning I had a regular period, not just spotting.  I also had night sweats for a week after my first dose and have had night sweats for the past week and a half since my second dose. Reporting this as it seems my period could be vaccine-related and I saw some reports on-line of others saying it may affect their periods.  My only other symptom was fatigue and a sore arm, both already expected.

Only other effect from injection was mild soreness at injection site for a couple days.

It stopped - as one would expect - yet only for three days. A second period started. Also heavy. Today is day 9 of bleeding. Seeing doctor tomorrow. In addition to period impact, I had sore throat for few days (hard to swallow) which turned into a scratchy throat and then a wee cough at night. I was tired; though could be loss of blood yet I believe it was independent.  So three main side effects: bleeding, throat and tired.

                                                15 hours after my first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine I had intense uterine pain. My arm also hurt a lot (tho that did not worry me as &#34;injection site pain&#34; is listed everywhere as a &#34;common&#34; side effect). I couldn&#39;t sleep because the pain in my abdomen was so strong; I finally fell asleep at 3 a.m. .. and when I woke up at 6 a.m. I was perfectly fine - no pain at all, not even my arm (!) Zero pain. Then 4 days later I got my period. Getting my period was notable because my last period prior to this was 5 months ago. I am reporting because nowhere are these side effects listed as possible so I was pretty scared. I have since heard anecdotes from people having similar side effects and so in case you are planning to update &#34;possible side effects&#34; I wanted to make sure to add my story, in case it could help someone in the future. Side Note: your website  warnings about false reporting are jarring and inappropriate. It is too bad that you believe so many people are planning to somehow sabotage this reporting system. Maybe it is necessary. But it sure didn&#39;t make me want to report my side effects. Thank you for reading my &#34;report&#34; ~

                                                This is the second shot.  My first Phizer shot was 3/27/21 Lot ER8732.  The first shot I was just ending my period.  Right after the first shot I started getting heavy cramps and experienced flooding, clotting, and cramping for the next 3 weeks.  After this second shot I was not having my period (having ended about 1 week before the second shot).  3 days later I again got heavy cramps and heavy bleeding.  I have not experienced the clotting as much this time - but I am bleeding MUCH heavier and experiencing uncomfortable cramps to the point I had to take some time off from work yesterday.

                                                At approx 5:30pm the day of the vaccination, I began feeling dizzy, almost as though I was intoxicated. The dizziness got progressively more intense and continued throughout the night, as well as for the next 3 days. I took 1200 mg of vitamin C which seemed to help, but the dizziness still lingures to this day. It comes and goes and occurs daily. I scheduled a telehealth appt with my GP for the following wednesday 4/28, and informed him. He said he hadnt heard of any reports of dizziness, and thought it&#39;s possible a second dose could make the symptoms worse, but he couldnt say for sure.  Today, 5/2, my menstrual cycle started and very heavily, but it isnt due for another 2 weeks. I have read about this happening with many other women reporting the same, their cycles starting shortly after vaccination, so it does have me on the alert and a bit concerned.

But the most traumatic side effect (that may or may not have been caused by the vaccine) was extremely heavy period bleeding. There was no bleeding, then a rush of blood running down my legs. It was quite heavy for a hour or so. Still bleeding heavily later in the day but not excessive. Cramps and leg pain as well. I am 50. My period symptoms vary quite a bit these days, but I have never had bleeding like this in my life.

Am presently debilitated by this. Blood test came back with a higher ANA. Saw a rheumatologist and will follow up this Tuesday.  Periods have been thrown off as well. Got it two weeks ago and then again today. The worst is the dizziness and weakness. There must be more to treat people who are suffering like me.

                                                Right inner ear whooshing coinciding with heartbeat began 6d post 1st Covid shot (had on April 15, 2021). Persistent and constant. Coupled with extremely high blood pressure; atypical for patient.  Ear whooshing went away 2 weeks after 2nd Covid shot. Intermittently returning 3&#43; weeks after 2nd Covid shot.   Three days post 2nd shot (May 9th), awoken at night with repeated intense &#39;adrenaline&#39; rushes/panic attack like feelings, which prevented sleep. The events seemed to occur at the moment the patient was about to fall asleep, then would jolt patient up. These INTENSE events continued for 4.5 hours. Patient tried deep breathing exercises to no avail. Patient eventually rose from bed and did multiple &#39;full body shakes&#39; to try and relax. Finally was able to sleep.   Patient experienced 2nd menstrual cycle in one month. Atypical for this person, who had never had any anomalous or difficult cycles in her life.  May 29. This night again experienced same adrenaline rush/panic symptoms overnight, again wholly preventing sleep. Patient took ibuprofen to relax muscles, to no effect. Patient again tried full body shakeout 2x. After 2nd time, was able to sleep after 4-5h of insomnia--complete inability to fall asleep.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reporting herself). This 50-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Apr2021 at 14:00 as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.

                                                Wednesday, May 19, 2021 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot  Summary: Wednesday, May 19, 2021 received my 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot.  My body tried to reject it. I threw up 5 times.  Ensued many unwanted side effects.  I don?t think it would be good to get the 2nd vaccine dose.  Given I am not fully vaccinated, I need an alternative solution to prevent being infected with the virus.  Help!!!! Please Help!!!   Bad Side Effects: Stuffy Nose Congested Nose Headaches  Vomiting Nauseous   Upset Stomach  Unsettled Stomach  Unusual Perspiration Pain in Left Arm Abnormal Period Menstrual Blood Clots Shoulder Pain/Tension  Upper Back Pain/Tension  Chest Pain/Tension  Shooting Pain in Chest Heart Palpitations? Numbness Runny Nose Sneezing Profusely Allergies? Hoarse Voice  Winded  Dry Mouth   Existing Worsened: Cold Sores  Stomach Noises  Snoring? Foot Numbness Ear Ringing Eye Floaters Joints Popping Sound    Other Observations: Stomach Bloated  Increased Flatulence    Pseudo Conclusion: Given my body?s adverse reaction I don?t think it is wise to get the 2nd shot. It is obvious my body does not like it.  I am disappointed because I really did not plan to get vaccinated; however, I felt I had no other option when the government made the announcement.  When the government announced No masks for those vaccinated, I know there would be some NOT vaccinated &amp; NOT wearing a mask thus putting me at risk.         I am okay with wearing a mask for another year or even for the next 5 years.  The doctors have said me wearing a mask is protecting others not necessarily myself.  I concluded even if I continue to wear a mask there would be others (NO mask &amp; NOT vaccinated) not following the rules potentially exposing me to the virus. Hence the only way to protect myself is to get vaccinated.  The vaccine appears to have affected so many areas of my body.  I regret getting the 1st shot, I want to remove every trace of it from my anatomy.  Please let me know if it is possible to rid the vaccine along with all the bad side effects from my body.  I do not want to subject my body to anymore of this vaccine; however, I still need a reliable solution to avoid being infected with the virus. I don?t know what to do.    Details: Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received my 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot around 3:30pm.  The medical staff had all those being vaccinated to sit for at least 15 minutes for observation to be monitored.  I stayed for monitoring for close to an hour (wearing my masks).  I felt fine, I noticed my right nostril felt stuffy, congested with a slight burn sensation. I noticed a slight headache when I left.  I had about 3 errands to do.  2 hours later I wasn?t feeling well.  In addition to a stronger headache my stomach felt queasy. Around 6:30pm I had to pullover to vomit; I threw off my mask and threw up once and then a 2nd time. I sat in my car taking deep breaths until I felt I could make it home.  I make it home around 7pm in time to throw up 3 more times, for a total of 5 times. The vomit tasted acidic, sour, citrusy, and metallic at times, and salty.  I was only throwing up the vaccine it was mostly clear with white alka seltzer looking deposits. I last ate some crackers around 12 noon.  Vomiting is NOT normal for me.  I can?t remember the last time I threw up, many many many years ago.  l had a headache, queazy stomach, and was exhausted; about 7:30pm tried to sleep. I got up around 10:30pm ate a few saltines and drank a little water but I still didn?t feel good so I didn?t eat anything else. Rough night trying to sleep, tossing and turning.   Next day (Thursday day 2) I felt slightly better, not comfortable enough for real food so I drank plenty of water in small amounts and ate saltines; headache subsided.  I also had more than usual underarm perspiration with a strong unfamiliar odor.    Wednesday, May 19, 2021 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot  It appears the vaccine affected my menstrual cycle.  My period usually lasts for 3-5 days max, usually light blood flow on days 4 and 5. It was a normal light day 5 when I received the vaccine.  After the vaccine, I began having heavy blood flow.  The heavy blood flow is accompanied by blood clots.  In the past I?ve had a blood clot here and there but not like this.  Menstrual blood clots for 9 days after being vaccinated. This is NOT normal for my body.  My period was 14 days. Prior to being vaccinated, I NEVER had a period last this long. To my surprise the vaccine affected my female organs.    I am right handed, so the nurse recommended using my left arm for vaccination.  Left arm where vaccine injected was very sore. Arm pain subsided after 3 days.  Pain soreness tension primarily on my left side, shoulder, upper back, chest area.  There is a shooting pain on left shoulder, down back to breast, chest heart area; pain comes and goes. Heart palpitations?  Experienced this for over a week about 10 days.    Numbness in left hand when I sleep on my left side, wake with my left hand numb. Numbness in both hands when I try to sleep on my back. Numbness in my feet after standing for about 15 minutes. Numbness in my leg and buttocks, primarily left side after sitting for an extended period of time. Before being vaccinated I only experienced numbness in my right foot after being on my feet for an extended period of over 4 hours.  Last year my right foot/heel would began to hurt after being on my feet for an extended period of time (&gt; 4 hours). Then there would be pins and needles sensation.  The solution would be to rest and elevate my feet. I also replaced my shoes (proper support).  Post vaccination even before the time my feet would hurt now my right foot goes numb within 30 minutes of standing even while wearing supportive shoes.  My left butt cheek goes numb when I am sitting with my legs elevated; this was my most comfortable position pre-vaccination.   Since the vaccine my stomach feels upset or unsettled especially in the morning. I am also noticing bloating and more gas than usual. My stomach is also excessively more noisy.    Before the vaccine my stomach would make noises when I was hungry or hadn?t eaten, but now there are so many stomach noises almost nonstop all day and night long all the time   My nose is feeling congested with a slight burn  sensation since getting the vaccination. Immediately after getting the shot my right nostril felt stuffy, congested with a slight burn sensation. This congested feeling comes and goes, especially noticeable when wearing a mask.  Prior to being vaccinated I had not experience this issue even as I have worn multiple masks for over a year with NO stuffy nose.    Saturday, May 29, 2021 (day 10 post vaccination) I get cold symptoms; runny nose and sneezing. I haven?t had a cold in years; I don?t really get colds; if so the symptoms are mild and quickly dissipate. Now my nose has been running pretty much non-stop causing me to blow my nose just as often.  I am also sneezing a lot. This is NOT normal for me.  I drank plenty of liquids; however, running nose and sneezing continued leading to hoarse voice. These symptoms prevented me from sleeping. I don?t know if these are cold or allergy symptoms. I had NO allergies before the vaccine.  These symptoms finally subsided after 3 or 4 days.   My neighbors are waking up in the middle of the night (2am, 3am, 4am, 5am).  I began to wonder if I am waking my neighbors possibly with snoring. I don?t really know, no evidence.   Throat feels winded and dry when talking especially when I try to whisper. I have to drink a lot of water.   Ringing in my ear started In 2019.  I thought this phantom sound went away; however, post vaccination I?m hearing the ringing sound again. It seems worse than before.   2018 diagnosed with eye floaters. I am noticing floaters more since getting the vaccine.  I usually see the eye floaters when going to light from dark. Post vaccination I am noticing the floaters even in dim light; not normal.   I started getting Cold sores in 2006.  I thought I had them somewhat under control. Since the vaccine l keep getting cold sores, this may be due to my menstruation.   Recently within the past year, my shoulder and elbow joints sometimes make this popping sound when I exercise/move my arm. Post vaccination my shoulders and elbows are making the popping sound every time I move my arm. Now sometimes my knees and ankles are also making a popping .

                                                My period has been lasting all the way up to now since the first shot on May 28, when I was in my period for 1 week or so.  At this point, my period has been almost 4 weeks long and will continue going on as I can see since the bleeding amount has drastically increased and become heavy 2 days after the 2nd shot administered on June 21. I went to my medical care provider on May 25, and reported this problem. And the provider ordered lab test, i.e. CBC and Prothrombin Time, for the the results have not come out yet. (continued in the section below). The provider also referred me to the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, for which I am waiting for their call. The following information is provided here in an hope to bring to your attention, which reveals that many women has experienced/been experiencing the similar problem as I do subsequent to be vaccinated: Tweet from Dr. regarding the abnormal period subsequent to got vaccinated. And many women replied to her tweet telling their own experience in this regard.

                                                After not having a period for 6 months, I started spotting one-week post 2nd vaccine. A week following that began an extremely heavy period lasting on and off (so far) for 2 months. Will have two or three days of nothing and then go back into heavy flow.  Doctor finally prescribed Megestrol to try and stop bleeding.

                                                Directly after the vaccine, within less than an hour, I experienced a tightness in my throat, and swelling of my lymph area around my throat. I still had air, but was concerned for the noticeable tightness of throat which continued for hours. This was better the next day, but since then, I have not stopped ?spotting? in an irregular menstrual spotting and has not ceased. Yesterday however,  7/7/21,  I was too tired to keep my eyes open in the afternoon, laid down for a power nap,  and there was a noticeable irregular heartbeat twice, in which I was awoken from my nap twice due to what seemed to my heart not beating normally,  my chest seemed heavy, and both times after waking from a nap and noticing, I noticed my left arm in the vein area slightly uncomfortable.  I have also had to take ibuprofen for a headache yesterday and on one other occasion ,  and yesterday my lymph in my throat were swollen slightly again- and neither of these symptoms are normal for my own body .  I did not get the 2nd dose yet , but due to tightness of throat, I don?t plan to either. I just feel like I should say something.

                                                I received dose 2 on tuesday 1pm, after 12 hours the fever kicked in and lasted 24 hours through late wednesday night rendering me fairly useless. But that&#39;s not the event I&#39;m reporting. On saturday, my period started, and it&#39;s literally the heaviest period that I&#39;ve ever had in my life (and it&#39;s still going). I&#39;m perimenopausal, and haven&#39;t had a period in 5 months, so at first I chalked it up to that, but the timing is suspicious so I asked around - there seems to be a lot of women who have been having off-schedule, very-heavy periods after their vaccinations. I&#39;m a research scientist and I think this  is worth investigating to see if it&#39;s truly a vaccine effect and what the implications are, especially knowing that covid affects clotting. I&#39;ve also submitted this info on pfizer&#39;s site.

                                                Would consider myself someone extremely healthy without any disease. My symptoms included intermittent migraines with rainbow halo around lights for two weeks, myalgia that I have never experienced. Vaginal breakthrough bleeding with period ( have IUD placement x2 years and haven&#39;t had bleeding  since).   In addition I experienced the normal fever, malaise and fatigue for the first three days following but wanted to report the extended symptoms that continued. Feel great now and am thankful, but thought it would be useful for research  purpose.

A 51-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Jan2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.Medical history included menopause or has been through menopause, Flu shot, hormonal issues, she started with a bizarre virus, whole lymph node response; It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting, she had a little infection and inflammatory markers come back positive. Concomitant medication included probiotics, vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) and vitamin d [vitamin d nos] (VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS]). The patient previously took flu for influenza immunisation and experienced peripheral swelling, tetanus vaccine for immunisation, amoxicillin, and experienced drug hypersensitivity, flagyl [metronidazole] and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient reported adverse events associated with her first Pfizer COVID vaccine shot. She experienced swelling in the upper breast area, swelling and pain in the neck, swelling in the armpits (for about 7 days) that got very itchy for 3-4 days but has since disappeared. She thought on whether to get the second shot of the vaccine considering these side effects since her doctor did not know why this was happening according to her. She thought she would report some side effects after one shot of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. It was strange. She did not read the symptoms until seven days out. Then she saw some have reported a lot less. After the shot, that night she had swelling in her upper chest. She thought it was lymph nodes in the breast and chest area on the side she got the shot. The next day her arm that she got the vaccine in got very large. Then, she does not know if it was related, two days later she had itching on both of her feet. It was the tops of her feet and only for a couple of days. She is not counting that. Day five after the shot has been the main problem. Her armpits started itching like crazy. It was severe itching and swelling in her armpits. The itching lasted for three to four days. The lymph nodes in her arm are still swollen. It was five days after the shot. It was both armpits. The night of the shot she had a lot of neck pain and she thought it was probably the lymph nodes in the back of her neck. That has lasted and was slowly diminishing. The patient was not planning on getting it. There was an agency that for assisted living for people that need help. They were giving it and had extra doses. This guy in charge at the assisted living house offered it to caller and caller&#39;s husband because her and her husband run a behavior health counseling. He offered it to them as healthcare professionals. He was given a batch for the residential agency but had extras. She was going through menopause or has been through menopause. She has hot flashes and has hormonal issues. The first week of December she started with a bizarre virus. She got tested for COVID and it was negative. It was not a rapid test it was a sendoff. Through that illness she had a whole lymph node response which was super unusual. The doctor said it was really strange. It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting. She had recovered from that and was back to normal. Four days before she got the shot all of that had resolved. Prior to getting the vaccine she had been tested for Lymphoma and it was negative, and she had a little infection, and her white blood count was normal. She had inflammatory markers come back positive prior to getting the vaccine. She went to the doctor on 27Jan2021 and asked if she should get the shot. The doctor said to do it because if she got COVID it would be worse. She was going to have a follow up with doctor for the ongoing stuff and he might do more test. Never in the course of any of that did she have itching armpits or swelling that lasted all this time. She never had chest swelling. The shot in the arm and it moved across her chest. It was reported that, back in the 90&#39;s, in 1993 or 1994, flu shots caused her arm to swell really large and stayed swollen for three months. That was the last three flu shots she got in the 90&#39;s. Then the doctor said not to get them. No one said why. She doesn&#39;t have allergy to eggs or anything that she knows to cause that. She has gotten all other vaccines and tetanus within the last 10 years. Her arm would kind of react but not like that. It went away in a reasonable amount of time. She didn&#39;t get a fever. The patient does not have NDC, lot and expiry for flu shots, other vaccines or tetanus to provide. When her kids were younger, they all had to be vaccinated for rabies. She did not have any reaction at all with those vaccines. She has allergies to antibiotics. She does not have lot numbers, NDC, or expiry for the antibiotics she was allergic to. She was allergic to Amoxicillin, Flagyl, Doxycycline, and Sulfa drugs. She has allergies to adhesive and contrast dye. No food allergies. She has allergies to dog and other environmental allergies. She does not take any medications for any of that. She has never had any anaphylactic shock of any kind. It has always been hives. The patient experienced swelling in the upper breast area/swelling in her upper chest, swelling and pain in the neck/neck pain, swelling and pain in the neck/neck pain, swelling in the armpits (for about 7 days) that got very itchy for 3-4 days but has since disappeared/severe itching and swelling in her arm pits/lymph nodes in her arm are still swollen/it is both armpits, arm that she got the vaccine in got very large, itching on both of her feet, red circle where she got the injection.

I did not feel the shot at all this time, but my arm was a bit achy soon after. One hour after the shot my leg muscles hurt and I felt fatigued. Two hours after the shot I felt really tired and really silly, kind of loopy. Three hours after the shot my L arm was hurting more and it hurt to take the band aid off. Then my stomach started feeling upset. I went to bed at 10:30pm and had a very rough sick night. I was awake most of the night, only dozing a few times. I had a fever (101) and chills; nausea and belching; dry mouth; aching and strange pains coming and going; a slight headache; and my L arm was hurting. By 7am I started crying, and I had more physical pain.  I got up at 8am feeling so sick with extreme fatigue, headache, and in a lot of pain in body. My Mom had to make my breakfast for me and I took small bites of that oatmeal throughout the day. I couldn&#39;t eat very much because my stomach was so upset. I felt hot and cold and got chills often during the day. By 6:45pm the fever returned (100.3) and I felt sicker again with head and tummy hurting; body aching; and nausea. Finally at 8pm I took 2 Tylenol which helped a lot, but then I worried what if that reduced the effectiveness of the vaccine. I went to bed at 9:15pm and fell asleep right away, but woke up many times soaking wet with sweat. The next day I still had trouble with temperature regulation and I felt very tired and headachy and my L arm still hurt. A few days later I got my menstrual cycle about one week early, and it was the strangest period I&#39;ve ever had. It was a very light flow, I had lots of clots, and along with the small amount of blood, there was lots of clear stretchy mucous like I get at ovulation. After my first vaccine dose I got my period a few days later also, but that time I only had brown spotting for 4 days and no regular blood flow at all, so this time it was slightly more of a period, but it was really not my usual kind of period. Overall, I felt completely whacked and wrecked by the 2nd dose. It was a terrible experience.

                                                About 5 days after initial vaccine I began a period that was the heaviest I had ever had.  After 10 days I contacted my Dr. who ordered blood work.  Did blood work on 4/5, by this time period had finally slowed to spotting.  Had 2nd vaccine on 4/6 and immediately started bleeding heavily again and about 4 days in had four or five clots the size of half dollars or larger.  Saw  Dr. on 4/14  and  ordered another blood test and was prescribed iron pills for anemia.  As of the date 4/20, I am still bleeding with no signs of stopping.

Also have few purple spots on legs, somewhat painful when touching. Went for my routine check up to my gynecologist and mentioned it, she recommend it screening for cancer, did not think due to vaccination. Did not go to the doctor for purple spots, I am keeping an eye on them.

                                                I am in menopause, 19 days after the shot I started bleeding and it is VERY heavy. I am still bleeding and it?s been 7 days still heavy as well.  I called the dr  on Thursday, April 29 and she set up an ultra sound , but I didn?t even mention to her that I had a shot because I hadn?t heard about this happening until I had already spoke with the dr. Also very tired but I think that?s from bleeding so much. Not sure if there?s any way to know for sure if it was caused by the shot but if they do t find anything else wrong with me I?m going to assume it?s from the shot since it seems to be happening to a lot of women

I also did not get my period, which was due 3days after the 2nd dose.  I?ve had hot flashes and cold/hot sensations every day and night since the shot.  I had not, ever, experienced hot flashes prior to the 2nd shot.  It feels as if the 2nd shot brought on instant menopause.

                                                My period started after being on menopause for a year.  It started in April 2021. Both of my breast have been in pain for past month.  This week, I got my period again, except much heavier than last month.  I had an MRI done last week and the lining of the uterus thickening was seen.  In the past, my period was only 3 days but this month, it&#39;s been 5 days and I&#39;m still bleeding.

                                                extremely heavy flow period that lasted 20 days; mild cramping usually occurring in the late morning nearly every day resulting in heavier discharge; slightly tired; sore arm; Achy joints; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 51-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EL9264; Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 07Feb2021 16:00 (at the age of 51-years-old) as second dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation at a workplace clinic. Medical history included perimenopause in which the patient was having longer durations between periods but relatively normal (for her) in length of four to five days, environmental allergies and a heavy menstrual bleeding in which was described as one period about 14 months prior that was longer and heavier than she typically experienced however it only lasted for just over a week with slightly heavier discharge with some clumps; all of which from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen; both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop dates were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin; clavulanic acid (AUGMENTIN) and experienced drug allergy. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EL3249) administered in the left arm on 17Jan2021 16:30 for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant. No other vaccine was given in four weeks. Patient was not COVID positive prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. On 09Feb2021, the patient experienced extremely heavy flow period that lasted 20 days. It was reported that the patient started her period approximately 48 hours before receiving the second dose of the vaccine and her flow was pretty typical until a couple days after her shot at which time she developed a much heavier flow with large, thick, dark clumps of bloody discharge. The patient also experienced mild cramping usually occurring in the late morning nearly every day resulting in heavier discharge, slightly tired, sore arm and achy joints on 09Feb2021. It was also reported that since the patient has history of heavy menstrual bleeding, she was not initially alarmed by the heavier flow. The patient began to have some concern as the period wore on but felt normal in every other way. No treatment was given for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered.

My periods were always regular and light to normal flow. The dates of my periods have been: January 6 February 1 March 7 March 30 April 18 May 2 May 17 Also, much heavier flow on the dates beginning March 30. I wanted to report this because I&#39;ve been reading that changes in menstruation may be a vaccine side effect.

Involuntary movements in my fingers in both hands.  My arms and hands still fall asleep at night and this did not happen to me before except on some rare occasion that I slept on my hand or arm.  I have been awoken by a limb that is asleep about 4 times since my vaccine.  Intermittent headaches for about two week after the vaccine and a very unusual, heavy and somewhat painful period with several large clots the size of a half dollar and lasting much longer than a normal period.  I felt dizzy and lightheaded for about a day.  I  have never had these kinds of periods before.

But upon getting her second shot, she had several days of light spotting and reported to my office on 5-11-21 for an exam.  Bacterial vaginitis was diagnosed at that visit.  The patient wants this event reported, in case this is a legitimately linked event.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 51-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- EP7534, Expiration Date- 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Mar2021 11:15 as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 51-years-old) and received BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- ER8729, Expiration Date- 31 Jul 2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 11:15 as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at Military Facility. Patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient medical history included that she was over-weight. The concomitant medications were not reported. Patient is the only girl in the house and she noticed after her first dose she skipped her period that month (Apr2021), her period did not come, which does not happen to her. Patient added her period is every 26 days pretty reliably. She had a period 09Feb2021 and 06Mar2021 and she did not have period again until 29Apr2021 which was 28 days later. She skipped it sometime in early April, clarifies she should have had her period on 01Apr2021. After 29Apr2021 she got it 16 days later and now she is waiting for her next period. She did not know if her next period would be normal or not. She did not know if her body was readjusting. She did not think anything of it until she started hearing things here and there about vaccines affecting periods and vaccine shedding. On 23Mar2021, patient experienced soreness in her arm which was hurting. On 24Mar2021, she was also very tired and had joint aches/body aches. Around 11 days after first vaccine (on 03Apr2021) she had stomach issues, like diarrhea for 4 days or something. She did not eat anything weird or unusual. No one else had it so it could not be a virus. She mentioned it to them and asked could it be a side effect of the vaccine and they said sure, it could be. The adverse events did not result in the emergency room visit of physician office visit. The outcome of the event skipped period was unknown, of the event stomach issues/diarrhea was resolved on 07Apr2021, while for other events was resolved on an unspecified date in Mar 2021 (reported as 25Mar2021 or 26Mar2021). No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

                                                Have been in menopause for 2 years with no menstruation (with 2 years prior to that of erratic periods).  Have had hormones checked and the low numbers also foot with menopause.  And 10 days after my first dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine, I got my period.  And it was very very heavy, heavier than any time in my life and made it hard to even leave the house for two days because of the constant need to deal with all of the blood.  It lasted 7 days and then went away.

                                                Low-grade fever, shaking chills, fatigue (especially in legs, which felt heavy), and headache began about 12 hours after shot and then ended within about 24 hours of onset, except for the fatigue. Mild fatigue, mostly in legs, persisted for over a month and then gradually got better and I think now it&#39;s gone (roughly 2 months after shot).   Also, I skipped a menstrual period; my period was due during the first few days of June but didn&#39;t start until July 1. The complicating factor is that I&#39;m 51, and though I&#39;ve never missed a period before, I know menopause has to start at some point. So I&#39;m not sure whether the missed period is an effect of the shot, or the start of perimenopause/menopause.

                                                I had a full menstrual cycle about a week after my first shot. I?m on continuous HRT and I don?t have cycles. I have occasionally had spotting, but very rarely. After the vaccine I had a full-on, week-long, needed-several-tampons-a-day kind of period. That was at the end of April. I just had another one at the end of June, which was slightly less heavy and shorter, but still not typical. And no, it isn?t just a coincidence or me confusing  it with something else. It is incredibly insulting when some doctors say things like that?if there is one thing most biologically-born women know intimately and very well it is our own cycles and bodies.

                                                1.  Migraines began 3 days after the second dose. I have had 1-2 migraines since my vaccination one month ago. (Treatment was sleep and Advil). 2. I had spotting (slight menstruation 10 days after the vaccine). I have been through menopause and not had a period for well over 4 years. 3.  I am very lethargic. I start my day with exercise and energy, but I have to come home and sleep...as in, take a serious nap around 4-5 days per week. This is very uncharacteristic! 4.  My ears are ringing terribly! I&#39;m accustomed to my slight tinnitus. But, on Monday, July 12th, they are ringing exceptionally loud.

                                                I had no side effects after my vaccine on 12/24/20 until 1/8/21. On Friday, 1/8/21 at 830pm I began with severe abdominal pain, low grade fever, nausea and loss of appetite. My abdominal pain persisted and worsened over the next 24-36hours. I presented to the ER on Sunday, January 10, 2021 at 8am with severe right lower quadrant pain, pelvic pain, nausea and low grade fever. I was promptly diagnosed with appendicitis and taken to the OR at approximately 2pm on the same day.  In the OR my appendix was gangrenous, there was pus in the pelvic area nd fluid in my peritoneum. My appendix was not ruptured. My appendix was removed as well as part of the omentum. I remained in the hospital on IV Metronidazole and Ciprofloxacin for 2 days and was discharged on 1/13/21 at 9pm. I am continuing to recvoer at home on the same 2 antibiotics in oral form. I have a JP drain that is still in place. Of note I had two negative COVID 19 tests on 1/9/21 and 1/10/21. Both were PCR tests.

                                                My right breast on the right side closest to the vaccine injection became extremely tender. I started running a fever and the breast became sensitive to touch, swollen and red. I had to go to an urgent care and it appears to be some sort of mastitis, but I am 52 and not nursing nor have I had any trauma to the breast. We don?t know that this was caused by the vaccine, but the symptoms came on approximately 48 hours after and it?s very unusual to get mastitis when not nursing. I?ve been on 3 different antibiotics and am still not well.

I have not had a cycle since this date and assumed I was in menopause, but was still ovulating. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose, I began bleeding, although it is light and without any cramping.

                                                I have been in chemically induced menopause since October 2019. 15 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine I experienced a menstrual period lasting 6 days.

                                                Within 15-20 minutes of receiving vaccine, I felt something in my chest. A slight pain or pang for a few seconds then it went away. The next day, I had noticeable visible swelling of my left breast and  lymph nodes under my left armpit even though injection was on rt arm. This was checked out by radiologist with a mammogram/ultrasound and lefts side looked fine, right side was suspicious of a legion which was biopsies and turned out to be fibrosis. Don?t know if there?s a connection to vaccine or not.  What was equally if not more concerning were the chest pains which returned a few more times getting stronger  that first week after the vaccine. It was a pulling sensation on the left side of my chest that, if 10x stronger, would feel (or be?) a heart attack. And that was after the 1st dose, so I am extremely hesitant to take the 2nd dose should those particular side effects intensify. I have googled it and can find no information about chest pains after the vaccine.  On a side note, my first cousin went into cardiac arrest after receiving his vaccination. He was dead and they brought him back. I?d like to avoid this.

                                                I started my period three days after I got vaccinated. I do have a heavy period because of uterine fibroids but this time it was even heavier than usual.  Every hour, I had to change a blood-soaked overnight pad during the first night.  After one night and a day of bleeding, on the second night, I had a near faint experience and I collapsed on the bathroom floor with nausea, cold sweating, hands numbing, short of breath.  My husband called an ambulance and I was transported to ER.  ER gave me fluid and did a blood check and gave me a medicine to reduce bleeding.  I was discharged a few hours later.  I am still bleeding but the amount is less. I have never experienced this severe period till I experience near faint.

A 52-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 21Mar2021 at 14:00 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included psoriasis of scalp from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included adalimumab (HUMIRA), loratadine, and omeprazole (OMEPRAZOL); all from unknown dates, for unspecified indications.  The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 27Feb2021 at 14:00 (Lot Number: EN6198), (at the age of 52 years old), as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  On 29Mar2021 at 15:00 the patient experienced vaginal bleeding, the patient got what appears to be her period although she stopped menstruating a year ago.  The patient stated they had both doses and no negative reaction, but the patient inquired if it&#39;s just coincidence or if there is a connection with getting your period suddenly start again after its stopped (patient had not had a period in about a year), since the patient did about a week after the second dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The clinical outcome of the postmenopausal bleeding was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                I started getting the arm lymph nodes being swollen right above my breasts and I was really scared. I am still tired from the vaccination. I saw the Dr. and they told me to place cold/hot compresses in my breasts. The swelling and pain is gone. The terrible nausea and diarrhea that I experienced had gone away after the day of the vaccination.

                                                05/18/2021 around 2AM I woke up in the middle of the night with severe chills and I took my temperature and it was 100.8 degrees. For me, I&#39;m usually at 97.2 degrees. Everything in my body hurt. I stayed home from work the next day and the fever didn&#39;t break. I never got sweaty but it just didn&#39;t break. I treated it with either ibuprofen or Tylenol. It eventually went away and I was fine. A week later on 05/25/2021 the same thing happened where I woke up in middle of night shaking and a fever of 101.3 degrees. Every part of my body hurt, behind my eyeballs hurt. I called my doctor and because I had a fever and she said I couldn&#39;t come into the office. My heart was fluttering as well and she said just go to the ER and get checked out and have them do a COVID test even though I&#39;m fully vaccinated. I went to hospital and they did a rapid PCR COVID test which came back negative but my blood work, liver was off, proteins were off. The doctor did not come anywhere near me and told me I had UTI, gave me antibiotic, and sent me home. I&#39;ve had UTI&#39;s before and I know what they feel like and this didn&#39;t feel like that. The next day 05/26/2021 I did a video visit with my doctor and I still didn&#39;t feel right. The fever part of it broke but she said that since I was still having the weird heart thing just go straight to ER so I said ok. The next morning my heart was fluttering so I went to the ER again but I went to a different hospital ER. They did blood work, EKG, Epstein-Barr, but no COVID test this time. My doctor had said to me that I really sound like I had COVID regardless of negative test. Again, the liver function was high, they did hepatitis ABC that all came back negative. Epstein-Barr came back high but not hugely high. They just said they didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me. They said it might be hepatitis or Epstein-Barr but I didn&#39;t have symptoms of mono. I did have tiny cough sometimes. They did a chest x-ray on me and didn&#39;t find anything mysterious. Over next few days they kept re-running blood and liver function test and it was still off for another 2 weeks. They sent me to cardiology because of shortness of breath and chest pain along with palpitations. He ordered more blood work and a stress echo. This past Tuesday 07/06/2021 he did angiogram thinking he would find blockages but he found nothing. He said my heart looked good but no explanation. I have never had heart palpitations before in my life. By 06/24/2021 my liver enzymes were back to normal but they&#39;re still not sure what is going on with my heart but from what he told me I don&#39;t have any blockages and my heart looks fine. My next appointment with cardiology is on 07/22 or 07/23. I was also having some vaginal bleeding and I was at the time 7 months into menopause. I went to Gynecology and they found polyps and I am going into have procedure to have polyps removed.

Noted that clothing seemed tight- especially underwear, bras, and shirts, arms and breasts visibly swollen on both sides. Breasts itchy. Some shortness of breath noticed that was surprising x3 during week. I am 1 week post vaccine and put 2&#43;2 together this AM. Initially thought that I must have put something in the dryer for too long, but EVERYTHING fits tightly. I recently had shoulder surgery and purchased clothing that was loosely fitting and It is now tight.  My BP on home machine is 133/86, which is generally normal for me. No fever. Fatigued all week that could be attributed to this or heavy workload. Generally feel good. Distal extremities normal in size.

Still experiencing the menstruation right now.  Will be seeing my doctor today for guidance as I&#39;m scheduled to get the second vaccine soon.

MAJOR CHANGE - 12 hours after vaccination, like a faucet turning on menstrual cycle break-through heavier somewhat clotted bleeding starting 4 days early which NEVER happens - convinced is due to the vaccine.  Flow for 12 hours then stopped for 12 hours, going on since but now into the regular week.  Want to know why.  VERY CONCERNED about girls such as 13-year olds and what the vaccine might do to their female bodies and ability to have children and to have normal cycles.

                                                I received the first covid vaccine on 1/4/21 and the 2nd on 1/25/21.  On Feb 22nd I started having heavy vaginal bleeding and severe stomach cramps.  These continued for 9 days and then I went to the Emergency department because I felt like my HGB was low.  They checked it and it was 11.3 and did an abd US that showed my endometrium was thick.  They recommended follow up with GYN and a biopsy.  I continued to have significant bleeding and cramps until the next week when I called the nurse line and they set me up with a virtual visit with GYN provider.  She started me on progesterone and scheduled a hysteroscopy and D &amp; C for the following week.  The progesterone slowed the bleeding down but I continued to experience abd cramps.  I had the D &amp; C and after getting home started to have heavy bleeding and bad cramps again.  The following week I called the GYN provider and she had me come in for another Abd US and checked my HGB which was 9.3.  She also checked for infection and other labs which were all within nml range.  The pathology from my D &amp; C was neg and the GYN really was not worried that is was anything other than a period but was surprised that it was lasting so long.  She gave me TXA and after 5 days on that the bleeding has now stopped but I am still having bad cramps in my lower abd and a lot of bloating.  Also having lots of jolting pains in lower abd.  I have never had  periods that were anything like this and never really had bad cramps like this before.

                                                About 39/40 hours after shot, I developed all the pre-menstrual symptoms that I would get in my teens and twenties (bad cramps in front and back; big (half of my nose big), painful cyst/zit on face; grumpy mood; blah energy), and then 1-2 hours later I started a period like I would get in my teens and twenties (very heavy and very red).  Still going after 5 days though finally slowing.  Never heavy enough that I was worried, but I have not had a period like this in a couple of decades.  And I have been peri-menopausal for 2 years now -- get my period very infrequently and sometimes its very light, sometimes its heavy.  But I never get cramps any more.  I don&#39;t get &#34;PMS&#34; grumpy-moody crap any more.  It is never &#34;red&#34; any more.  And it never starts in a rush like this one did any more (even when it is heavy).  And it usually peters out after 3 days -- hasn&#39;t lasted 5 days in years and years.

                                                First dose was administered on 1/22/21 (lot#EL3302) after which I began with hormonal fluctuations consistent with pre-menstrual symptoms (would be normal for someone 2 Yrs POST-menopausal) On 2/15/21, following my second dose on 2/12/21, I experienced the onset of what could only be described as menses, which, although extremely light, continued for 3 days.  Coincidentally, on 2/19/21, I had an annual exam scheduled at which I mentioned this odd occurrence.  I was advised that post menopausal bleeding is not normal and I needed follow up tests.  I am relatively informed and explained that my experience was not random bleeding, it was truly a menstrual period with all symptoms relating to such, but decided to follow through with testing to be sure.  I had an ultrasound performed on 2/25/21 which noted an endometrial stripe of 5mm (1mm wider than ?normal?) and a hysteroscopy was scheduled and performed on 4/9/21.  Biopsies taken and visual inspection showed NO abnormalities whatsoever and my bleeding occurrence was considered idiopathic.  In speaking with the physician, she refused to acknowledge that the Covid vaccine could have had anything to do with the event, but several others I know in healthcare have stated that there is a possible link and there is documentation to support.

The next day, (4 days after my first dose), I experienced very strong (the strongest I&#39;ve ever felt) cramping and a very large piece of uterine lining expelled from my body. Again, very bright red color. I just received my 2nd dose on 4/22/21 and am waiting to see if I have bleeding and/or cramping again.

About a week and a half I had my period for the first time in over a year.  I then, more recently had an even stronger cycle, a little over 3 weeks after my 2nd vaccine.   This second cycle, while quite heavy, lasted a typical period of time for me.  Approx. two days of heavy flow and then quickly tapering off.

                                                I have been having night sweats from 5-10 times per night, and hot flashes approximately hourly throughout the day, since the second shot.  This has not ebbed or flowed but unfortunately been consistent, every day and every night.  I have also not had my period. I am in the age range for menopause, however, until the second shot, I had regular periods and only night sweats two days during my period. I had not had any hot flashes.  It seems to have come on like a storm and most certainly could simply be peri-menopause, but it does seem strange to have been so sudden.   Additionally, I have arthritis in two fingers that never really hurt much. Since the 2nd shot, it&#39;s been very painful.

I also missed a months period after my vaccine (60&#43; days since last period).    There was pain in my right ovary area and that leg hurt a week after my 2nd vaccine.  It stopped after taking Tylenol .    The bleeding on my upper gums continues-more bleeding occurs in the morning, but also happens when cleaning or touching.  Very pronounced bleeding from minor touch of toothbrush or floss.  I visited dentist and asked me to set a new routine which included a prescription mouth rinse to rule out gingivitis or periodontal disease.  He also ordered a deep cleaning in the near future.  It is now June and the bleeding still exists (3 months after vaccine).

A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 at single dose at Arm Left on 28May2021 at 17:58 for COVID-19 immuniation (53-year-old at vaccination).   Relevant history included positive ANA, Interstitial Cystitis and Ocular Rosacea. Relevant concomitant drug included Doxycycline at 50 mg twice daily for ocular rosacea since 1 week before getting the vaccine to 27May2021. She noticed an increase in urination after starting it. Was told it was okay to get the vaccine while on it. Stopped it due to irritation in her stomach. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history relevant to AE(s). The patient explained she has experienced various side effects from the first dose. She reported having &#34;excessive, frequent and urgent urination&#34;, which lasted for three hours the night she was vaccinated.  She mentioned the arm where she was vaccinated was &#34;cold to touch and sore.&#34; Her &#34;little finger and ring finger in both hands&#34; were &#34;numb and tingling&#34;, which then spread to her arms. She then listed the following as additional symptoms: &#34;intermittent headaches, waves of nausea, and gums that have been bleeding easier than normal&#34;. She then explained before vaccination she has not have her menstrual cycle for quite a while, and it then started since 09Jun2021 (reported as yesterday). She specified this morning, her periods were &#34;heavy, flooding&#34; with &#34;cramps&#34;, which she had never experienced &#34;at that level&#34; before/ &#34;more than typical&#34;. Lastly, she reported a weird pain in her upper legs since 07Jun2021, at the &#34;top part&#34;, which started in her left leg and radiated to the right one, last night. She described this weird pain as &#34;deep in&#34; her legs, &#34;not a muscular pain&#34; but one that is either related to her &#34;blood vessels or nerves&#34;. She said this pain is &#34;not constant but shooting&#34;.  She asked if these symptoms are normal after getting the vaccine. The patient further specified that evening she had excessive, frequent and urgent urination; she was drinking more that day, but not that much more. That same night, her left arm was cold to the touch and sore. She also woke up during the night with numb and tingling fingers on both hands; it was her little finger and ring fingers on both hands; it would start in her hand and go up her arm. She had intermittent headaches and waves of slight nausea. States that she has not had a full menstrual cycle for some time, but yesterday she started her cycle and last night it got heavier, and today it&#39;s really heavy, like it&#39;s flooding. She also has really bad cramps. Her gums have been bleeding easier as well for the past couple days, but she did not see any blood today when she brushed her teeth. Also, she has leg pain; it started in her upper left leg on the 7th, deep in a vain, almost like a nerve pain, but last night it was in her right leg; it comes in waves. The pain is in the top inside part of her legs. It&#39;s either a nerve thing or a blood vessels thing. When she was experiencing the frequent urination, she started wondering if the vaccine was all leaving her body, so now she doesn&#39;t know if she has the protection from the vaccine. Is there a way to check that? She has Interstitial Cystitis anyway, and there are a lot of things that can flare it up, but this just lasted longer. States that it lasted about 3 hours, and now she is back to her normal. While it was occurring, it was excessive, she went to the bathroom about 8-10 times an hour and her pee was clear. States she was trying to drink more water to make sure she didn&#39;t get dehydrated, but as soon as she drank, she would have to go again.  She stated the intermittent headache and slight nausea, she expected to have after the vaccine. The cramping from her cycle is easing up, but the flow was really heavy earlier today, but in the last hour is has slowed a bit.  On the night of 08Jun2021, her gums were really bleeding when she was brushing her teeth, and last night they were bleeding, but this morning there was no bleeding at all, so hopefully it&#39;s stopped but she won&#39;t really know until she brushes her teeth tonight. The events did not result in Emergency Room or Physician Office visit.  No relevant tests performed.  The outcome of event pain in leg, gums have been bleeding was resolving. The outcome of other events was resolved. The patient was due to get her 2nd dose on 10Jun2021, but she was nervous to get it.  She has auto-immune concerns; she has a positive ANA. Her doctor told her that she definitely needs to get the vaccine.  She had her second dose scheduled on 18Jun2021.    Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

I don&#39;t know how long it will last.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  This 54-year-old female (non-pregnant) patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 15:15 (Lot Number: ER2613) as single dose (at 54 years old)  for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included endometriosis, asthma and allergies to Tylenol, shellfish, mushrooms. There were no concomitant medications. Previously the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 in left arm on 05Mar2021 04:30 PM (Lot Number: EN6205) for COVID-19 immunisation. On 20Apr2021, the patient experienced &#34;I had a variety of side effects, but I am submitting this report about my postmenopausal bleeding. I have been bleeding for two days now. I don&#39;t know how long it will last&#34;. No treatment required. The outcome of the event was not recovered. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

I soaked through pads and the heaviness lasted longer than a typical period for me.  After my second shot, my period didn&#39;t come on time, but instead I had cramping and period symptoms, as well as watery discharge for over  a week. Then, it came about two weeks late and lasted for two weeks (though light bleeding this time). I also had sore breast and night sweats. I am likely in perimenopause, but was regular up to this point.

Second dose given 04/23/21 and by 04/28/2021 I started bleeding again And by the second day I was soaking through pads and huge clots were coming out. This has never happened to me before.  After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results &#34;there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.&#34;   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain. That evening I passed a huge blood clot!  I&#39;m very grateful it was where it was and I could expel it.  But there&#39;s no doubt the second vaccine caused this issue that has never happened to me before. I still get my periods though irregular and very light. So this event was highly unusual and very painful

It was uncontrollable. I tried to get up to walk it off. My body started shaking even more. I felt as though I were having a stroke. To stop my shaking, I placed one hand over the other but that didn&#39;t work. I fell back into bed. I called 911. The person said my reactions were normal side effects. They refused to send an ambulance because they said I sounded fine.  On May 9, 2021, I started cramping. I haven&#39;t had a period in over three years. On May 13, I started spotting. This morning (May 14), I woke up bleeding.

Approximately one moth after getting my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I began to have a period (menstruation) for the first time in one year. The period lasted a week. As noted previously, I have not taken any medication before or after taking the vaccine, which is why I suspected that the vaccine was the cause of my sudden menstruation. I was scared of this adverse reaction, which is why I decided not to take a second shot dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

Prior to that time, I would menstruate regularly, with a very light cycle.    Approximately 17 hours after my first Covid 19 vaccination, I started menstruating very heavy with large clots for 3 days. Approximately 60 hours after my second Covid 19 vaccination, I started menstruating very heavy with large clots for 3 days.

This 54-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 25Feb2021 afternoon (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) as single dose to protect herself against the virus. Medical history included progesterone symptoms of  sleeplessness, hot flashes, and various symptoms; hormone replacement therapy. Concomitant medication included progesterone (UTROGESTAN) and estradiol benzoate (ESTRADIOL) both taken for progesterone. There has no prior vaccinations. She had the first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Feb2021 in her left arm (lot: EL9264) for COVID-19 immunisation. On 02Mar2021, 5 days later she got her period and had very heavy bleeding, this never happens to her. The patient started her 2nd period and bled through her clothing, which never happens to her. She also had a heavy nose bleed (not sure of the date) since the 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose. She only had one nose bleed. She had the second dose on 25Feb2021, and since then she has had 2 menstrual periods. One was 5 days after the vaccine. She didn&#39;t think much of it but had extremely heavy bleeding which was not like her. She never had that, usually she had had light periods her entire life. She was at the grocery store, and it literally went through her clothing. She had to go home and wash everything. Her period right after the second dose was also heavy, not as heavy as this, but heavy for her. She went to (Site name) when to be concerned about when a period is heavy, not about the vaccine. It also occurred to her that she also had a nose bleed, and it was a nose bleed. It felt like her nose was running. She hasn&#39;t had something like that since she was a child. It really was like a regular nose bleed. Again, she didn&#39;t think of the vaccine. Since this is happening she is wondering if there would be a correlation. The bleeding started Tuesday and is very heavy today. It has only been 2 periods and this one was worse. The event did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of very heavy bleeding was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

Minor arm  pain. No actions were taken.   On April 22, vertigo began gradually and was intense by the morning of April 23. This included the sensation of intense spinning. The vertigo continued intensely  for about three weeks and then tapered off until June 1, when there was no more sensation of spinning. Bonine and the Flonase provided adequate relief during this period.

I had a fever of  102 .The following day the nausea that I started to experience  was horrific to the point where I felt like I wanted to vomit but  I just could not throw up, and  was also experiencing  fatigue and constant vaginal infections. I have had two periods and and nonstop bleeding after the second dose. I will be going to get an ultrasound next week in regard to what I experienced with the vaginal bleeding.

They sent me to a biopsy which was abnormal - benign proliferative endometrium. But my endometrium is not supposed to be doing that because I am in menopause. So I researched this and it has also happened to other women as well. So basically doctors do not know.

Also, this second period was much more heavy and lasted longer than the one previous month). I didn?t assume the periods were related to the COVID shots until I saw an article about other women reporting same.  Just wanted to share this in case it turns out to be related to COVID vaccination.  Will wait to see if I have another period in May, since no more shots.

                                                With my first shot, my arm became sore 8-10 hours after the injection and stayed that way for about 24 hours. With my second shot (also in the left arm), I had the same reaction as the first injection; however, about 3 days later I woke up with a large lump under my left armpit. Over the next few days, I had swelling on the left-side of my left breast, swelling under the breast and below the left collarbone. This has been very painful, especially at night when I lay down. During the day, it seems to drain (relieving some of the pressure). As of today, I am 6 weeks out, and I still have some swelling on the outer left of my left breast. The lump under my arm has disappeared and the swelling under my collarbone has gone as well. Now I am dealing with sore muscles in my neck and shoulder on my left-side. I believe this to be because I could not hold my arm in a normal position for a number of weeks. My doctor ordered physical therapy for this issue.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 55-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0168, NDC number and Expiry Date are Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm deltoid on 21May2021 around 13 to 13:30 (at the age of 55-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic sinus infections, caffeine addict. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0169, NDC number and Expiry Date are Unknown) administered in Left arm deltoid on 15Apr2021 at 11:00 or 12:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced, doesn&#39;t have the heart fluttering anymore, excessive sleep, feels younger after her vaccine, more frequent hot flashes than she would normally feel, hasn&#39;t had a period since her shots. On an unspecified date in 1999, at the age of 33 years, the patient received historical Vaccine, Pneumovax vaccine and she had high fever, she was really sick, she thinks the nurse put the bolus really close to the bone in her Deltoid, she had a black bruise. Caller states the reason she did have that vaccine at such a young age is because she was having chronic sinus infections and the ears, nose, and throat doctor suggested she had it and it helped quite a bit. The patient also received historical vaccine, Flu Vaccine (Onset Age: yearly) on an unspecified date and states she tends to get pretty sick from a flu vaccine, so she tends to avoid them. Caller states but she did get a flu vaccine this year and she didn&#39;t seem to have too much of a side effect. Patients medical History including any illness at time of vaccination was none. Vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect were none. Family Medical History Relevant to adverse events was not provided. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin (AMOXICILLIN) taken for an unspecified indication, on an unspecified date for two weeks and she heard she can get infections in the lining of her heart or whatever, but she has sinus infections frequently and she&#39;s been on antibiotics many times, so she doesn&#39;t relate antibiotics to this getting better because she&#39;s been on antibiotics for many years. Caller states time time actually, she has a dog that&#39;s on Clindamycin, but she&#39;s on Amoxicillin, which is the typical thing they give her so it&#39;s very interesting. Caller states she will see if it lasts or will come back at some point. Caller states she is definitely correlating it with her shots. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Caller states she&#39;s not sure if her side effect is adverse. Caller states she always had, she thinks its related perhaps to menopause, she always had like a flutter of her heart that she would feel nearly everyday, every other day. Caller states she would get a little tightness and she doesn&#39;t know some kind of a syncope would happen. Caller states she never had her heart checked with the doctor. Caller states since she got her shot 15Apr2021 and her second shot was delayed, she doesn&#39;t have the fluttering anymore, isn&#39;t that interesting? Caller states her second shot was delayed because a week after the first dose, she caught a sinus infection and had to have antibiotics so she got her second shot this last Friday. Caller states she wanted to call she knows this kind of information is important. Caller states everybody wants to bash companies, like the whole thing with Accutane, she said they totally helped her. Caller states there are so many disclosures, they shouldn&#39;t have taken it if they were concerned. Caller states maybe Pfizer has discovered a solution to murmurs or whatever. Caller states she feels younger after her vaccine. It was reported that she doesn&#39;t have the heart fluttering anymore and states it was just this flutter she would get, she was very conscious of it every time it happened. Caller stated, it&#39;s been going on for a couple of years, she read something that it happens to women if their estrogen drops. Caller states her menopause came late and since she&#39;s had her shots, it hasn&#39;t happened for sure because she&#39;s just so conscious every time it happens. Caller stated, prior to the second shot is when the fluttering stooped, she would say in the first week or two after the first shot. Caller stated, she thought oh my gosh it was gone, so she felt like that before her second shot. Caller states she got her first Pfizer shot on 15Apr2021, she was supposed to get her second dose the first week of May but she was on antibiotics still so she waited a few days past her antibiotics and time and for it to be convenient so she got it last Friday so she could convalesce, her dog had a dental thing. Caller stated she&#39;s gotten hot and can&#39;t tell if its a hot flash or the vaccine. Caller states she has had more frequent hot flashes than she would normally feel and she had a headache on Sunday on 23May2021 and now its gone. Caller states but that could have also been a lack of caffeine because she is a caffeine addict. Caller states she didn&#39;t have her morning coffee until really late that day, so it could be caffeine withdrawal. Caller states she drank water and then she went out to the pet store and she got a coffee and then she felt okay within the hours. Caller confirms she has recovered completely from the headache. Caller states caffeine always helps a headache. Caller states she never gets headaches, it was really weird. Caller states her cure for a headache is caffeine. Caller states she went for 10 years without drinking coffee and she rarely gets headaches. Caller stated, she felt a little bit sick on Saturday on 22May2021. So she watched movies with her dog, but that was it. Caller stated, they are saying women are getting heavier periods, it could be a hormonal effect, she imagines it will eventually come back. Caller states she has a degree. Caller states she was working and is reading a lot of science, she read tons about this whole thing and she doesn&#39;t relate it directly to the shot, it&#39;s some effect on the hormone system, maybe its not all bad. Caller stated, she was going to tell Pfizer, the first shot, the only side effect was excessive sleep. Caller states she was sleeping 12 hours the first day, the first night. Caller she slept for 14 hours the next night, and the next night it was 12 hours, the next night was 14 hours, slept again a ridiculous amount of time, 12 or 15 hours. Caller states she got it on Friday, she&#39;s a planner, she slept so deeply and it was really great. caller confirms it began at 20:00 at night the night of her vaccine 15Apr2021. Caller states she went home and she was in bed at 20:30 and didn&#39;t get up the next day until 1130, she doesn&#39;t know if she fell asleep immediately, she thinks she slept 14 hours, it was great and she loved it. Caller stated that she didn&#39;t get that much sleep on an unspecified date in May2021 with the second vaccine, she was a little disappointed. Caller stated she doesn&#39;t really consider these adverse effects, just side effects. Caller states they don&#39;t seem too negative to her, she will see if her hormones will adjust and if her fluttering comes back. Caller stated that she hasn&#39;t had a period at all since her shot too on an unspecified date in May2021. Caller states she had gotten to where she was weaning. Caller states she had regular periods until the age of 55 and she had a bunch of candied hibiscus and its known to really suppress estrogen and she sort of put herself into menopause and so she was having less frequent periods, but since she&#39;s had her shot, she hasn&#39;t had any. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know how related that is or not. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know if its ever coming back, that will be alright though. Caller she doesn&#39;t know if the weaning of it is related to the shot or not. Caller stated thanks for getting the shot out there. Caller states there has to be some special honor for these development teams. Caller states presidents have those medals and awards they can give. Caller states the scientific teams at these science companies she thinks they basically saved the world. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know, it could wipe out the globe, it&#39;s a nasty little bugger. Caller states anyway she&#39;s writing and encouraging others to do the same. Caller states she&#39;s writing the white house and her federal representatives saying and especially these developmental scientists, one of them immigrated from an # but these are teams of people that pull this off and she thinks it would be absolutely appropriate to get to the other side of this. Caller states she thinks we have a year to go, she will not be taking her mask off. Caller states they really deserve a high honor. Caller stated that honestly she did not want to take the vaccine until 9 months had gone by to see other people&#39;s side effects but because she has a science background, she knows the more the virus spreads, the more it will mutate, so she felt it was a societal obligation. Caller states she has a friend whos an emergency room doctor and they had a talk and the doctor is basically like she&#39;s got to get it, everybody&#39;s got to get it, and the caller&#39;s like okay, she&#39;s going to get it. Caller states she just thinks that she is obligated to get it or this is gonna go on and on and she thinks this virus came out of the lab, it seems very engineered to her. Caller states it&#39;s the most dangerous virus the globe has really seen. Caller stated that she hasn&#39;t had any problems. Caller states her doctor is her age and she doesn&#39;t want to expose her or her staff unnecessarily. Caller states she hasn&#39;t tried to see her in the past year and a half unless she actually has to. Caller states she&#39;s avoiding the doctor, she loves her doctor, she doesn&#39;t want her to get sick. Caller states when she did go see her, she got a COVID test and quarantined for five days before, she doesn&#39;t want to expose her to anything, she wants to make sure she&#39;s safe, she doesn&#39;t plan to see her doctor unless it&#39;s really absolutely necessary. The time of onset (24-hour clock) of adverse Events was not provided. It was reported that adverse events did not require a visit to: Emergency Room, Physician Office. There were no Investigation assessments and relevant Tests were none. The outcome of the event, headache was recovered on 23May2021 and for other events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I&#39;ve been in menopause for approximately 2 years, but after receiving my second Covid vaccine, I experienced heavy &#34;menstrual&#34; bleeding .  It began Monday morning following my Saturday vaccine administration.    It was accompanied by headache and abdominal discomfort, different than typical menstrual cramps.  The bleeding continues, although it has lessened.   I did not experience this symptom after my first shot, but had the more typical flu-like symptoms. I had Covid in March 2019 and received positive antibody results in May 2019.

That receded after an hour or so, but then I had the worst herpes nerve pain down my legs that I&#39;ve ever had. Took the acyclovir and mostly avoided the breakout, but felt bad for a few days. No fever. A week after the vaccination I started to feel dizzy on and off then 10 days or so later started having weird heart palpitations and pressure in my chest. I ended up in the ER. They said I wasn&#39;t having a heart attack but the condition has continued on and off as well as the dizziness. I also got a period 3 weeks after the shot having not had one for almost 2 years. I&#39;m still not feeling well 4 weeks after the 1st shot with fatigue, intermittent dizziness and heart issues. I&#39;ve been advised to hold off on the second shot. The dizziness was diagnosed as vertigo.

                                                After the first vaccine, I had the expected headache, fatigue, slightly sore arm, slight nausea, and headache which lasted a couple of days. I then developed what felt like menstrual cramping and acidic stomach pain, but I hadn&#39;t had a menstrual cycle in seven months, and only two in the past two years.  On the 11th day after my vaccination, I had very light bleeding for a day. I didn&#39;t connect it to my being vaccinated at all. In the past, I always experienced acidic stomach pain right before my period. I was concerned about cancer so made an OB appointment right away. I didn&#39;t see her until two weeks after my second vaccine. I was given the second dose three weeks later on April 21, 2021, and the morning after I had the same side effects as with the first dose--headache, fatigue, slightly sore arm, slight nausea, and headache. Two days later on April 23rd, I began having vaginal bleeding again, only three weeks after the first vaccine. The bleeding was very heavy and lasted for ten days--longer than any vaginal bleeding I&#39;d ever had and much heavier in flow.

On Monday, all other side effects had resolved, but began having more (pseudo-period) blood spotting Monday afternoon and evening.  My last period was August 2018 (over 2 years, 9 months), so assumed to be in menopause.  The bleeding/spotting was definitely a surprise.  No treatment (yet), waiting to see if spotting will end within the next day or so.

On April 11th I had period like symptoms, clotting, big chunks that is still continuing as of today April 30th.  I have been to several doctors to figure out why the bleeding is happening and the doctors can not find anything wrong  and have recommend  hysterectomy.  I was given medroxyprogesterone 10 milligrams to be taken for 10 days starting April 13th for 10 days 3 times a day.  Then reduce down to 1 time a day.  On day 10 I reduced down to 1 a day and the bleeding came back to soaking one extra large pad in less than 30 minuets.  The doctor told me to continue on three a day till the bleeding tampered off.  After I got my 2nd shot on April 28th the bleeding was heavy again and I am back to taking the pills 3 times a day.  I was only on 2 pills a day for 2 days.

A 58-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0151), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included cysts (fibrocystic cysts in her breast and a baker&#39;s cyst behind the knee many years ago), Ovarian surgery, blood pressure and blood potassium. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that she read an article online about the women who took the Pfizer vaccine should report if they were having menstrual issues. She stated that she took her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 13Apr2021, and on 12May2021 she started having periodic premenstrual symptoms, like cramps. She stated that she has her regular menstrual cycle now, and she had cancelled her second dose. Because of her side effects she put off her 3 week booster shot that was scheduled for 28Apr2021 at 1400. She did not show up and was waiting to hear from a couple physicians regarding a lump on her inner right thigh that was moving around. She had trouble finding it the next day. She checked the other side to see if it had to do with fat composition or whatnot. It disappeared and she did follow up with her primary physician on it.  Her primary physician said that if it had been a blood clot, she would have felt pain, but was not sure about that. Patient stated that she has not been able to find the lump. The patient&#39;s physician said that the patient could reschedule the vaccination as she could have it within 42 days. The patient stated that about a week and a half ago, she experienced extreme premenstrual syndrome in her breast and under her armpits and under her lymph nodes, cramping on monday and tuesday and some time yesterday, and the last 2 days she has been passing small blood clots like menstrual. The patient stated that the PMS has subsided somewhat. The patient has been taking ibuprofen. She has not had PMS or a period for at least 5 years. Last night, the patient stated that she was on the internet reading articles regarding the Covid vaccination and menstruation issues, and it is being reported but not fully. The patient described as: it seems like they were trying to keep it hush. The patient had side effects so bad over the weekend, the past weekend. The patient scheduled an appointment with a gynecologist whom she will visit in the middle of June because of these symptoms. The patient stated that she was afraid that she will get a mammogram and was not sure what&#39;s going on. Patient described that it was a kind of weird. The patient noticed the lump around approximately 24Apr2021 or 25Apr2021. It would have been between 2 and 3 weeks after the first shot, not even 3 weeks. The patient stated that she visited her physician in the first week of May and told her physician that she was having trouble finding it, then she felt it and didn&#39;t feel it again. It made her very queasy the first time she felt it. The patient stated that she had cysts in the past. She had fibrocystic cysts in her breast and a baker&#39;s cyst behind the knee many years ago. The patient stated that the cysts felt weird like soft and were moving around. It made her queasy. The patient stated that she has had the premenstrual syndrome in her breast and under her armpits and under her lymph nodes for at least a week. She used to get this during her monthly cycle during that time, she forgot what they call is severe PMS. The patient stated that she was going through very severe PMS just like that up until 2015. There was a year she had an ovarian mass removed and her fallopian tubes. She only has one ovary left. Once her period went away it went away. She never suffered, maybe slight PMS until she was fully into menopause. It has been this last week. She couldn&#39;t get out of bed because she had cramping and was in pain. She never used to cramp except in high school. The patient sated that she doesnt really feel lumps in her lymph nodes, it is just very tender and her nipples were highly sensitive. Underneath and along her rib cage and under her armpits is very warm to the touch. It is like a very bad premenstrual syndrome. It is definitely not warm or hot anymore, it has gotten better. The swelling has gone down, and she last noticed any blood clotting last evening and the clots were tinier like little dots. The blood clots started on monday 17May2021. The patient had cramps when she was in bed in the morning, then after she took pain medicine it subsided. The patient stated that she had no cramping today. The first time she had cramping was Monday 17Apr2021. The last time she had cramps was yesterday. The worst was on tuesday on 18May2021. Tuesday night was the worst for the blood clots too. She doesn&#39;t know. She hadn&#39;t had them for 5 years then it came upon recently. She doesn&#39;t know if she has recovered completely. She doesn&#39;t know if the cramps or the blood clots will return. If it goes like a normal cycle like before pre-menopause it will go away and then come back the next month. The patient stated that after she urinated today, she did not see any blood, and she was not using a pad. The blood clots have pretty much cleared up. The patient stated that she was reading and looking on the internet at ingredients and it was so scary and she was really scared. Patient stated that it was 42 days since her first dose. It would have been 42 days yesterday within the time limit to have the second shot of the booster. Now it is the forty third day and she has not had it. She was reading that it can be given 90 to 120 days. She is getting mixed messages. The people she lives with are high risk, and that&#39;s the only reason she got it. The case was assessed as serious. The patient stated that she was taking Ibuprofen and her symptoms subsided somewhat. Treatment was taken for events. The outcome of the events was resolved for cramps and resolving for other events.   Information for lot number has been requested.

States her boobs are swelling/breast implant swelling; swelling became so hard and so swollen; pain; pressure in the chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient), from a Pfizer sponsored program. A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection Batch/Lot number was not reported, Expiration Date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Apr2021 (at the age of 57-years-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  It was reported that, the patient received her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on 4Apr2021. Starting on 7Apr2021, she reports experiencing swelling in L breast implant, which eventually went to both breasts. Said she was in pain, they were really hard and she couldn&#39;t button shirt. It got worse, and she went to all kinds of different doctors, including PCP, hormone, and plastic surgery. Was told by several docs that it was because of the vaccine. Swelling did subside 2 weeks ago, and she wants to know if 2nd dose is contraindicated and if it is too late to get it. 11 weeks, 1 day out right now. Worried about side effects or if the swelling will return. She asks if she waits too long, is her body going to overreact, or are there any complications or interactions between the 2 doses for those people? She asks if we know of anyone that waits that long and if there are any adverse reports with that. Caller states had first dose Pfizer on 4Apr2021 and then 7Apr2021, on Wednesday, she experienced in her left breast implant. States her boobs are swelling, went to her doctor where she had the surgery, on the 14Apr2021, gynecologist told her it was related to the Covid 19 vaccine. States its been 11 weeks since she had the first dose, is second dose contraindicated, is it too late. Caller clarifies that it was not just a little swelling in one breast, states that is just how it started, swelling became so hard and so swollen, states she could not button her blouse, states it felt like someone was pinching her boob, states she went to her ER doctor for pressure in the chest to make sure it wasn&#39;t something with her heart, they sent her to her primary doctor who ordered hormone tests, then sent her to a hormone doctor who did more tests, she went to her gynecologist, and they all said it was from the Covid vaccine. States as of two weeks ago the swelling went down. States she is rushing, she trying to work, already missed a lot of work for this, just wants an answer to her questions. Clarifies she wants to know if it is too late to get her second dose, is it contraindicated, what is the guidance now for how to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Felt OK otherwise until 12 noon on 1/6/21 when I suddenly felt chilled and not well.  Temp went up quickly from 99.4 at 12 noon to 102.4 at 5PM. Temp 101.5 at 9PM.  Had abdominal cramping, general body aches and muscle pains, H/A and left breast tenderness as if I was going to get my period (which I haven&#39;t had for 8 years). On 1/7/21 at 7AM temp- 99.7 and 98.8 at 11AM, but still felt tired, H/A, malaise, no appetite. Back to normal good health on 1/8/21 AM. Left arm was sore for 4 days.

                                                After first vaccine I developed a rash under both arms that was hard pustules and then the skin became very sensitive and my breasts became sore and swollen.  I also had swelling under my injection site arm. This almost  cleared up before my 2nd vaccine except for the skin sensitivity and swelling under both arms. After the 2nd vaccine 3/3/21 within 48 hours my breasts became very swollen and painful and the under arm sensitivity became much worse. It is 2 weeks since the second dose and my breasts are still slightly swollen and tender. This is hopefully resolving, but was very painful and uncomfortable.

                                                5 days after first shot, Left breast swelled up, got warm and turned reddish in color.  Breast got hard and large lump around nipple.  Called OB/GYN and was checked by them.  They sent me for a mammogram on left breast and ultrasound as well.  Was told that this was a common adverse reaction to covid shot.  I did not know that.  Would have waited to defer the cost.  After second covid shot same breast was a little sore but not as bad as first shot.

                                                I&#39;ve been post-menopausal for about four years.  Yesterday (April 26, 2021) I experienced a brief episode of vaginal bleeding.  It wasn&#39;t heavy enough to require a pad or tampon, and occurred around the same time as I was relieving myself.  I had read that others had experienced  post-menopausal vaginal bleeding as a side effect after receiving the vaccine, so I decided I should report this instance.   Other than being constantly exhausted - which I&#39;m not sure is a side effect of having had Covid-19, a side effect of receiving the vaccine, or just because I&#39;m older - I haven&#39;t had any adverse side effects.

Since my second dose (April 15) , I am now experiencing menstrual-like vaginal bleeding. Because I am post-menopausal (last period was in December 2017), this is concerning to be experiencing a menstrual like side effects. I continue to have minor vaginal bleeding for the last 7 days. I don&#39;t believe this is related to my tamoxifen prescription, as I have been on tamoxifen since April 2018 with no such side effects.

                                                Immediate symptoms arm pain, dizziness then within an hour bad headache.  Arm pain pretty bad for almost 2 weeks.  Arm pain had just gotten better and I went for a routine nuclear stress test.  The evening after the test I was woken by thump in my back and chest about 5 times.  After waking, I would become extremely dizzy.  I got up went to the bathroom each time.  Every time I tried to go back to sleep I would be woken by thump again.  Byy Wednesday I was in the ER with Tachycardia.  Pain in left side and heart racing continued.  I was in the ER again 4/30 and 5/3. I lost 10 Lbs  My left side pain throughout my ribs, back, should blade and stomach distension still occurring.  The left side of my back and my left breast are swollen.  I have had mammogram, CT scan, ultasound and MRI&#39;s plus many visits and calls to many different specialists - heart, GI, Endocrinologist, OBgyn, and primary care doctors over the past 2 months with no answer as to what occurred.  I am taking metropol for the heart racing and it has helped but the left side swelling and pain is persistent.  I am not sure if this relates to the shot but maybe a combination of the 2?  I do not know what happened to my body, but have never experienced anything like this before.  And I had a nuclear stress test at age 40&#43; with no problems.  My heart was fine but it was completed because of family history, lyme disease and babesia.

It was a small amount of blood for 24 hours then it stop.  I had a pap done which was normal and I have not had another episode.  I followed up with my gyno.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 04May2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172; Expiration Date: Oct2022) at the age of 58-year-old as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Menopause since May2011 been in for 10 years and ongoing, she has been on and off hormone replacement therapy for those 10 years. Concomitant medication(s) included Progesterone and Estradiol taken for hormone replacement therapy from 12Aug2020 and ongoing. From the first dose, patient experienced Left arm pain on the same day on 04May2021, and was on fatigue started the night of the shot. The next day, on 05May2021, she continues to have headaches, not every day, frequently. She is not inclined to headaches because she drinks a lot of fluids. She has been extremely bloated started on 05May2021. Nauseous started on 06May2021. She felt like she was going nuts. It is persisting, not worsening. She is so not inclined to nausea either. It is kind of blowing her away how her body is reacting to this whole thing. Patient got a period, has been in menopause for 10 years. She was bleeding on 02Jun2021 or 03Jun2021. It was significant bleeding, not spotting. She was using her daughter&#39;s tampons. It persisted until 09Jun2021, she used naprosyn (Lot: 1AR0657, expiry: 36871UWF7, Exp: Oct2022) in day to stop the bleeding. No bleeding since about 09Jun2021. Patient got the second dose on 25May2021, exactly three weeks after first dose, 04May2021. She was still so nauseous, has headaches and fatigue. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. Treatment for nausea: Tums, is generic. She was taking something that was like a generic for Mylanta. She is now taking Ultra-strength natural antacid tablets, calcium carb USP 1000 mg, taking two of those. Took it after ran out of generic for Mylanta (UPC: 5042837052, Lot#: 80735, Exp: Jan 2023). Both manufactured by CVS health, and have the same information. Treatment for headaches: Tylenol 500mg, also generic from Costco. She takes the generic for Bayer aspirin, she quit taking it because she was afraid it exacerbated the bleeding, so she switched to the Tylenol. She knows the Tylenol is expired but can give codes on it - it&#39;s Acetaminophen, Exp: was Feb2019 and the code underneath that is 7EE1277A; NDC is [withheld]. It is 500mg, 500 come in the bottle, states she has two bottles and cannot say if she took from both, she has one upstairs and one downstairs, she reduced one to a smaller bottle, so wouldn&#39;t have information to provide, and regardless, they were a two pack, so it would be real close to the same thing. And Bayer is equivalent of aspirin genuine, 325mg. She was primarily using this until the bleeding, she realized it would just make the blood thinner, then switched to Tylenol or acetaminophen. Aspirin: generic aspirin, UPC 5042832084, adds P124656, Exp: Mar2023. She was taking one 325mg and if the one didn&#39;t work, was taking a second one. Treatment for fatigue/bloating: no treatment, has a very old diuretic but did not take anything. Patient had a biopsy of her cervix with unknown results at the time of reporting. The outcome of fatigue and fatigue, Bloated feeling, nauseous were not recovered, other event outcome was unknown.

                                                started menstrual cycle after not having it for 8&#43; years; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Healthcare Professional, the patient. A 59-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 59-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, diabetic, and known allergies to all penicillin&#39;s and macadamia nuts. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included dulaglutide (TRULICITY), metformin, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), trazodone, terbinafine hydrochloride (LAMATER). The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 21Jan2021 at 16:00, the patient reported her menstrual cycle started after not having it for 8&#43; years. Post vaccination, on 25Jan2021 the patient was tested for COVID-19 via nasal swab with an unknown result. The clinical outcome of the event, menstrual cycle started after not having it for 8&#43; years, was unknown.

Then some dark menstrual discharge.  She thought it had stopped, but this afternoon had dark bloody clots/discharge when wiping.  She is not having as bad of cramps.  Sunday and morning were definitely worse days than today.  She has not had a  menstrual cycle in over 15 years, she is 60.  She did not take anything for the pain.  She is still having the symptoms, and actually worse than it was earlier.

I went to Urgent Care. They did a CBC to rule out internal bleeding, an ultrasound of stomach and an internal vaginal ultrasound. These tests were normal and they referred me to an obgyn, for an Endometrial Biopsy. This biopsy was completed on 3/17/21 and on 3/20/21, the results came back as normal. I am post-menopausal and have not had my period for about 10 years. I also submitted a report today to document the adverse event after my 2nd Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine that I got on 4/5/21.

A 59-year-old female patient (Non Pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 12:15 PM as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Graves Disease and seasonal allergy. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, liothyronine and seasonal allergy, etc. Allergies to medications, food, or other products: penicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Late night on Saturday 27Mar2021 23:45, the patient started getting cramps in abdomen, then she noticed blood in urine. Cramps subsided after Advil but work up the next morning with a blood flow. It&#39;s been 5 years since her last menstrual period, with very little spotting in those 5 years. It&#39;s been a week since the cramping and she was still getting dark (gross) spotting. This was very unusual for her body. Not sure if she should take the 2nd Pfizer shot. No treatment was received for the adverse event (except cramps in abdomen). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of cramps in abdomen was resolved with sequel. The outcome of others was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Felt like it went to my joints such as my knees. Chills, weak and been unusually tired, this never went away.  My second Covid shot was May 13, the same thing happened same arm, 10-15 minutes later pain shoots down my arm to my wrist where the surgery was performed. Then my joints, so much pain brought me to my knees in tears. Experienced chills and ached all over Exhausted with periods its hard to stay awake. Now I feel like it has settled in my joints especially my knees where fibromyalgia is the worst, I need an cane to walk. I received ab cortisone shot in each knee on 5/21/21. no help, now my right calf hurts to walk even with cane.  On May 26 I started my period. I havent had an period in 6 years, I&#39;m 59 years old.
