All symptoms but the rash improved the following day. I went to have my 8 week pregnancy US 6 days after this second vaccine dose and there was no fetal heart rate. The baby measured 8.7mm and there should be a heart rate  when the baby measures &gt;7mm. I had all of my pregnancy symptoms up through the day of the vaccine and then they disappeared the day my vaccine symptoms improved. I do not have a history of miscarriage.

I began bleeding and cramping and having headaches approximately 10 days after my second dose. I sought medical attention and was told that my baby no longer had a heart beat and that growth (based on ultrasound) had stopped around the 9 week mark. I had medical assistance to physically miscarry the deceased fetus. I have one healthy living son (2 years,  4 months old) who was delivered without complications naturally.

                                                Starting within 6-8 hours of the vaccinations, I began some menstrual spotting. This has been ongoing lightly for the two days following the vaccination. Initially it was just a tiny bit of pinkish discharge noticed after using the bathroom, but now its is more of a very light menstrual flow. It should be another two weeks before my cycle returns, so this is way off schedule. I cannot think if anything else that has changed and would cause this.

I still have those weird sensations 18 days after getting the vaccine.  Also, I had many small blood clots during my first menstruation after the vaccine (13 days after vaccine), which is not normal for me.

                                                My first dose was 1/14. I found out I was pregnant on 1/26/21 and I miscarried at about 10 weeks. About 15 mins after I got the vaccine, I had a racing heartrate and my palms were hot, but it went away. Around 3pm, I had a right frontal headache. I took a nap and it went away. About 5am Fri, I woke up to severe arm pain and it felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach. I took about 400mg of Ibuprofen, went to sleep and was fine when I woke up. About 5pm Friday, I began having vaginal bleeding. I called my doctor and was able to get in on Feb 11th. At my OB/GYN appointment, they tested my blood and urine, which confirmed my pregnancy. The NP examined me and told me that the bleeding was coming from my cervix, so they sent me for an ultrasound the following week. That&#39;s when I was given my calculated date of 10 weeks. A gestational sac was observed, but they weren&#39;t sure if a fetus was present. I had to see my doctor every week since I was still bleeding and that continued until March 18th, when I lost the pregnancy completely. I took my specimen to the doctor the following day. They told me that they were sending it out to be tested, but I&#39;m not sure if the results are back. They did confirm that it was a fetus.

Flow was unusually heavy and very clotted - all abnormal for me. While I may have felt some fatigue from the shot, I never felt ill in any way.  I also never felt any of the points of pain I might feel with my normal period, such as sore breasts prior to my period and cramps in my upper legs when it arrived.  I only had a sore arm for a day where I received the shot.

                                                Significant pain in both shoulders and neck. Bilateral shoulder pain has lasted for 3.5 weeks despite only receiving vaccine in left arm, both times.  Pain feels arthritic in nature and has made it hard to function. After the first shot, I got my period early and after the second shot, I have not had my period/missed a period (I have never missed a period before in my life except when pregnant 6 years ago).  Also had left breast swelling that lasted around 1 week after the second shot.

                                                Within an hour of receving the vaccine, I became dizzy, had face tingling and arm tingling and felt mentally foggy.  As the day progressed, I felt a fullness in my throat and fatigue.  Over the next week, the dizziness became worse, I experienced intense headaches and shortness of breath for several days. I had difficulty sleeping and vivid dreams.  I have had thyroiditis twice in my life after giving birth to my 2 children with similar dizziness and throat fullness.  I decided to contact my doctors and had my thyroid levels checked.  My TSH was abnormal and my doctor thinks I could be having another episode of thyroiditis.  My menstrual cycle arrived a week early.  Following this, I continued to have dizziness, throat fullness, and intense headaches.  I developed sore breasts and breast discharge as well as in increase in frequency of urination.  I decided to postpone the second shot until I was feeling better as past episodes of thryoiditis took about 2 months to resolve.  My next menstrual period was a week late, also accompanied by mood swings, breast tenderness and intense headaches.  SIx weeks later, I continue to experience occasional dizziness and throat fullness and increased urination.  Prior to the vaccine, I was feeling fine and it seems like the vaccine triggered some kind of hormone/endocrine response in my body.  I have not had reactions to any vaccines prior to this.  I am quite hesitant to receive the second vaccine and am wondering if I should wait a period of time and try something  different such as the Johnson and Johnson one.  I? not quite sure what in the Pfizer vaccine ( perhaps the mRNA?) could have triggered this reaction in my thyroid and endocrine system. and would appreciate guidance on what to do next as I would like to be fully protected from COVID-19 but do not want to endure these unusual side effects.

                                                I was approximately 4 weeks pregnant at the time that I received dose #1 (12/23/20)- I was unaware of the pregnancy. I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

I&#39;m in healthcare and in the operating often for airway and ENT procedures.  I received my shot at 9:00am on 1/29/20201 and began spotting at 11:00am.  The spotting continued (very light) until 9:00pm.  I decided to go to bed since I wasn&#39;t feeling well.  I woke at 2:00am with contractions and heavy bleeding.  I went to the ED at 3:00am on 1/30 to confirm my miscarriage.  I weighed 121 at the ED when triaged. My EDD was 08/19/2021

The joints that do normally hurt were way worse (my back, and right big toe joint). There was a pain in my right eye, and that eye had blood vessels burst in it.  36 hours after the shot= started bleeding from my vagina. My last menstruation was 2 weeks ago and this is VERY unusual for me. Normally my periods are 30-32 days apart.

This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

                                                About 4 hours after the first vaccine, numbness and tingling all over the body. Left arm went completely numb and tingling. Scalp tingling and numb. Felt like circulation was cut off. Severe Shortness of breath. Extreme feeling of adrenaline. The next day on March 14th, had extreme vaginal bleeding on day 14 of cycle. Bled for another 7 days which led to extreme anemia. The shortness of breath is every day since the first dose. Heart palpitations (heart rate went up to 190!). After the second dose on 4/03, all symptoms got worst. Left leg went completely numb the same day which I went to the emergency room for. The neurological tingling and numbness was spreading to my whole body. Arms, legs, face, ears, scalp, inside my head. I was worried for a heart attack since all of my symptoms of left arm and shoulder pain and numbness etc. I was released from the emergency room 12 hours later. I continued to have severe symptoms. The shortness of breath was so bad that I didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights straight because my oxygen would drop. I also had severe insomnia and no appetite and lost 5 pounds in 1 week. Major adrenaline feeling. I went back to the emergency room 2 more times this week to check out my heart and lungs. All of my doctors recommended ER since they couldn&#39;t help me. My neurologist said he is getting lots of these symptoms from people post vaccine.  My shortness of breath and elevated heart rate and numbness and tingling are still here and I can barely go up and down stairs without being out of breath and having a 130-140 heart rate and super low blood pressure and night sweats. It is awful.

A 44-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Apr2021 15:45 (3:45 PM) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history includes Shellfish Allergy (Reported she has had a shellfish allergy for a long time, approximately 7-8 years). She said as long as she had no shellfish, she was completely fine. There were no concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date as the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient previously took bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunization on 14Mar2021 first dose intramuscular at the left arm (Lot Number: EN6208). It was reported that the patient has received both doses of the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Her second Pfizer Covid vaccine was received on 04Apr2021. Caller started her menstrual cycle on 07Apr2021. She experienced abnormal vaginal bleeding that night. The following day on 08Apr2021 she passed out at work and was transported to the ER via ambulance. She was advised by the ER provider that her symptom was not related to the Covid 19 vaccine. However, she spoke with her OBGYN and was advised they have heard that abnormal bleeding maybe caused by the Covid 19 vaccine. The patient asked if symptom has been reported? It was further reported that she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 14Mar2021, and her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Apr2021 at 3:45 PM (PST). She clarified later in the day on 04Apr2021, the COVID-19 Vaccine kicked in. She said she felt sick on 05Apr2021. She said she felt uncomfortable on the morning of 05Apr2021, but still went to work. She said she felt OK once she got to work, but then took time off from work (on 05Apr2021) because she felt uncomfortable. She said when she got home from work (on 05Apr2021), she took 2 Tylenol. She said she was cold, and her body temperature went up, and she was kind of sweating. She clarified her hands and feet were cold, and later in the day (05Apr2021) her body temperature went up. She said she was aware of the COVID-19 side effects because some of her friends had similar symptoms, so she was kind of expecting the symptoms. She said later in the evening on 05Apr2021, she took 2 Advil and went to bed. She said her body felt warm, but she thought her symptoms were to be expected. She said on 07Apr2021, her (menstrual) period started at 10:00 PM. She said she had abnormal (more than usual) vaginal bleeding for the whole night. She said on 08Apr2021, she felt uncomfortable in the morning when she was getting ready for work. She said she went to work (on 08Apr2021), and at 1:30 PM passed out while at work. She said from her work, she was sent by ambulance to the Emergency Room. She said she was not sure if her passing out had anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine, but she had never passed out at work before. She said she asked the Emergency Room doctor about the COVID-19 Vaccine and her passing out. She said the Emergency Room doctor said her passing out had nothing to do with her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she read more online about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she then asked the nurse at her OBGYN&#39;s office about abnormal bleeding after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the nurse had heard of some cases of abnormal bleeding after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her OBGYN&#39;s nurse told her to call to find out if her abnormal bleeding had anything to do with her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her OBGYN&#39;s nurse provided her with the number to get more information about the COVID-19 Vaccine. It was added that while she was at the Emergency Room, she had 7 vials of blood taken, 2 ultrasounds; an external one of her tummy (abdominal ultrasound), and an internal one where something was stuck in her (transvaginal ultrasound).

                                                I had my first dose of Covid vaccine, Pfizer 30ug at 3:40pm on 4/8/21. 1 day after my first dose I started have low fever(98.8-99.2f). 2 days after my first dose of Covid vaccine my left breast start being painful and start whole body ache. 4 days after first dose my left breast start having an half egg size painful touchable lump with red, warm and swelling.  I started taking Acetaminophen 10 mg bid. 4 days on 4/11 till today after first dose  for both pain control and reducing body temperature.  I used to have granulomatous mastitis on my right breast which is self limited and I had not have this problem for one year. Although the mechanism is still unclear but some theory of this disease is more like an autoimmune  problem.   I doubt somehow this vaccine has too strong immunogenicity, or at least which is too strong for me. I was getting Pfizer which is 30ug I think.  Possibility: 1 Too large dose for my body size (120 lb) 2 Some adjuvant in this Pfizer vaccine induces too strong cellular immune response which may initiate or help for some none Covid specific antibody production, unfortunately for some patients who have autoimmune disease are triggered by this vaccine then they may start producing autoimmune antibody which start self attacking.

                                                On January 4th i was sitting down eating my lunch and when I was done and went to get up I couldn&#39;t put weight on my left foot. Felt like i sprained it. The pain was there for two and a half days and suddenly it went away and i was ok. Now this past sunday January 10th my period came, 15 days earlier, and is really bad. I have to change pads like every two hours because of the amount of blood coming down and is still going on today. It has never lasted this long and I have not bleed this much for this long either.

Now, as today 2/3/2021 I started to have my menstrual period again (just 2 weeks after the previous menstrual period) I always have my menstrua periods regularly every 26 to 28 days. There was only one time in 2012 when I had Dengue virus that my menstrual period came very early as well, at that point I had a CBC done showing thrombocytopenia with Platelets at 110.  I am planning to have a CBC test done. I suspect that my platelets are low again. I want to make sure the vaccine is not causing me thrombocytopenia and to report this event for future data collection.

She also had bilateral nipple tenderness and severe left breast tenderness to the point where she needed to take Motrin. She also had what felt like menstrual cramps. The most significant symptoms lasted about 10 days, but are persisting at a lower level. She saw her GYN for a routine appointment and the GYN found masses in both breasts, more noticeable in the left, and uterine pain during the pelvic exam.

Bleeding lasted until bedtime and was gone, along with the abdominal cramping and burst of energy by the next morning and has never returned.  Vaccine #2 was on 2/9/21 and the only difference I felt after that one was tiredness; took a 3 hour nap shortly after I returned home and never noticed anything else since.  (Not sure if this helps to know...I had a hysterectomy mid-October, 2020.)

A 48-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient started a light period on Sunday which continued for 5 days. She had a Mirena IUD for almost 7 years (second one inserted 2 years ago). She don&#39;t have a period with Mirena; every couple months she will spot for a day but it does not require a tampon. However, the day after her injection she had light bleeding on 28Mar2021 for 5 days which required light tampons to control so it didn&#39;t ruin her clothes. Treatment was not received for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered. Event was reported as non-serious.

                                                Post-menopausal menstruation: I have been in menopause since December 2019, which is to say that I have not had a menstrual period in almost a year and a half. However, some time after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine , I experienced familiar symptoms of ovulation and PMS (tender breasts, vaginal discharge, and cramping).  Then on May 8, 2021 (approx 2 weeks after receiving my second dose of the vaccine), I began menstruating heavily. Very heavily. On May 9 and 10, I continued to menstruate heavily. And, at the time of this writing (May 11), I continue to menstruate.

I am now on day 6 and swelling &amp; tenderness r declining. On day 3 I noticed a swollen &amp; tender lymph node on top of my L clavicle.  One hour after my vaccination I had an issue with my vision that my eye doctor diagnosed as a visual migraine. I had never had one before.

On March 4th I had my 6-week ultrasound and one embryo had implanted but did not survive and the 2nd was clearly not strong, smaller than it should have been with a fetal heartbeat only visible, not audible yet.  A week later, on March 11th, the ultrasound showed only empty gestational sacs and I had miscarried both.

                                                I received dose 2 on tuesday 1pm, after 12 hours the fever kicked in and lasted 24 hours through late wednesday night rendering me fairly useless. But that&#39;s not the event I&#39;m reporting. On saturday, my period started, and it&#39;s literally the heaviest period that I&#39;ve ever had in my life (and it&#39;s still going). I&#39;m perimenopausal, and haven&#39;t had a period in 5 months, so at first I chalked it up to that, but the timing is suspicious so I asked around - there seems to be a lot of women who have been having off-schedule, very-heavy periods after their vaccinations. I&#39;m a research scientist and I think this  is worth investigating to see if it&#39;s truly a vaccine effect and what the implications are, especially knowing that covid affects clotting. I&#39;ve also submitted this info on pfizer&#39;s site.

My symptoms included intermittent migraines with rainbow halo around lights for two weeks, myalgia that I have never experienced. Vaginal breakthrough bleeding with period ( have IUD placement x2 years and haven&#39;t had bleeding  since).   In addition I experienced the normal fever, malaise and fatigue for the first three days following but wanted to report the extended symptoms that continued. Feel great now and am thankful, but thought it would be useful for research  purpose.

A 51-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Jan2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.Medical history included menopause or has been through menopause, Flu shot, hormonal issues, she started with a bizarre virus, whole lymph node response; It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting, she had a little infection and inflammatory markers come back positive. Concomitant medication included probiotics, vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) and vitamin d [vitamin d nos] (VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS]). The patient previously took flu for influenza immunisation and experienced peripheral swelling, tetanus vaccine for immunisation, amoxicillin, and experienced drug hypersensitivity, flagyl [metronidazole] and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient reported adverse events associated with her first Pfizer COVID vaccine shot. She experienced swelling in the upper breast area, swelling and pain in the neck, swelling in the armpits (for about 7 days) that got very itchy for 3-4 days but has since disappeared. She thought on whether to get the second shot of the vaccine considering these side effects since her doctor did not know why this was happening according to her. She thought she would report some side effects after one shot of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. It was strange. She did not read the symptoms until seven days out. Then she saw some have reported a lot less. After the shot, that night she had swelling in her upper chest. She thought it was lymph nodes in the breast and chest area on the side she got the shot. The next day her arm that she got the vaccine in got very large. Then, she does not know if it was related, two days later she had itching on both of her feet. It was the tops of her feet and only for a couple of days. She is not counting that. Day five after the shot has been the main problem. Her armpits started itching like crazy. It was severe itching and swelling in her armpits. The itching lasted for three to four days. The lymph nodes in her arm are still swollen. It was five days after the shot. It was both armpits. The night of the shot she had a lot of neck pain and she thought it was probably the lymph nodes in the back of her neck. That has lasted and was slowly diminishing. The patient was not planning on getting it. There was an agency that for assisted living for people that need help. They were giving it and had extra doses. This guy in charge at the assisted living house offered it to caller and caller&#39;s husband because her and her husband run a behavior health counseling. He offered it to them as healthcare professionals. He was given a batch for the residential agency but had extras. She was going through menopause or has been through menopause. She has hot flashes and has hormonal issues. The first week of December she started with a bizarre virus. She got tested for COVID and it was negative. It was not a rapid test it was a sendoff. Through that illness she had a whole lymph node response which was super unusual. The doctor said it was really strange. It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting. She had recovered from that and was back to normal. Four days before she got the shot all of that had resolved. Prior to getting the vaccine she had been tested for Lymphoma and it was negative, and she had a little infection, and her white blood count was normal. She had inflammatory markers come back positive prior to getting the vaccine. She went to the doctor on 27Jan2021 and asked if she should get the shot. The doctor said to do it because if she got COVID it would be worse. She was going to have a follow up with doctor for the ongoing stuff and he might do more test. Never in the course of any of that did she have itching armpits or swelling that lasted all this time. She never had chest swelling. The shot in the arm and it moved across her chest. It was reported that, back in the 90&#39;s, in 1993 or 1994, flu shots caused her arm to swell really large and stayed swollen for three months. That was the last three flu shots she got in the 90&#39;s. Then the doctor said not to get them. No one said why. She doesn&#39;t have allergy to eggs or anything that she knows to cause that. She has gotten all other vaccines and tetanus within the last 10 years. Her arm would kind of react but not like that. It went away in a reasonable amount of time. She didn&#39;t get a fever. The patient does not have NDC, lot and expiry for flu shots, other vaccines or tetanus to provide. When her kids were younger, they all had to be vaccinated for rabies. She did not have any reaction at all with those vaccines. She has allergies to antibiotics. She does not have lot numbers, NDC, or expiry for the antibiotics she was allergic to. She was allergic to Amoxicillin, Flagyl, Doxycycline, and Sulfa drugs. She has allergies to adhesive and contrast dye. No food allergies. She has allergies to dog and other environmental allergies. She does not take any medications for any of that. She has never had any anaphylactic shock of any kind. It has always been hives.

                                                My right breast on the right side closest to the vaccine injection became extremely tender. I started running a fever and the breast became sensitive to touch, swollen and red. I had to go to an urgent care and it appears to be some sort of mastitis, but I am 52 and not nursing nor have I had any trauma to the breast. We don?t know that this was caused by the vaccine, but the symptoms came on approximately 48 hours after and it?s very unusual to get mastitis when not nursing. I?ve been on 3 different antibiotics and am still not well.

I have not had a cycle since this date and assumed I was in menopause, but was still ovulating.

Some shortness of breath noticed that was surprising x3 during week. I am 1 week post vaccine and put 2&#43;2 together this AM. Initially thought that I must have put something in the dryer for too long, but EVERYTHING fits tightly. I recently had shoulder surgery and purchased clothing that was loosely fitting and It is now tight.  My BP on home machine is 133/86, which is generally normal for me. No fever. Fatigued all week that could be attributed to this or heavy workload. Generally feel good. Distal extremities normal in size.

                                                I received the first covid vaccine on 1/4/21 and the 2nd on 1/25/21.  On Feb 22nd I started having heavy vaginal bleeding and severe stomach cramps.  These continued for 9 days and then I went to the Emergency department because I felt like my HGB was low.  They checked it and it was 11.3 and did an abd US that showed my endometrium was thick.  They recommended follow up with GYN and a biopsy.  I continued to have significant bleeding and cramps until the next week when I called the nurse line and they set me up with a virtual visit with GYN provider.  She started me on progesterone and scheduled a hysteroscopy and D &amp; C for the following week.  The progesterone slowed the bleeding down but I continued to experience abd cramps.  I had the D &amp; C and after getting home started to have heavy bleeding and bad cramps again.  The following week I called the GYN provider and she had me come in for another Abd US and checked my HGB which was 9.3.  She also checked for infection and other labs which were all within nml range.  The pathology from my D &amp; C was neg and the GYN really was not worried that is was anything other than a period but was surprised that it was lasting so long.  She gave me TXA and after 5 days on that the bleeding has now stopped but I am still having bad cramps in my lower abd and a lot of bloating.  Also having lots of jolting pains in lower abd.  I have never had  periods that were anything like this and never really had bad cramps like this before.

                                                After receiving the first dose on 4/1/21 Lot# ER8733, I had light spotting for 2 days.  Second dose given 04/23/21 and by 04/28/2021 I started bleeding again And by the second day I was soaking through pads and huge clots were coming out. This has never happened to me before.  After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results &#34;there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.&#34;   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain. That evening I passed a huge blood clot!  I&#39;m very grateful it was where it was and I could expel it.  But there&#39;s no doubt the second vaccine caused this issue that has never happened to me before. I still get my periods though irregular and very light. So this event was highly unusual and very painful

                                                After first vaccine I developed a rash under both arms that was hard pustules and then the skin became very sensitive and my breasts became sore and swollen.  I also had swelling under my injection site arm. This almost  cleared up before my 2nd vaccine except for the skin sensitivity and swelling under both arms. After the 2nd vaccine 3/3/21 within 48 hours my breasts became very swollen and painful and the under arm sensitivity became much worse. It is 2 weeks since the second dose and my breasts are still slightly swollen and tender. This is hopefully resolving, but was very painful and uncomfortable.

As of today, significantly smaller, but still there.  If I had not just had a mammogram, would have thought it was some rapid growing breast cancer.

Then some dark menstrual discharge.  She thought it had stopped, but this afternoon had dark bloody clots/discharge when wiping.  She is not having as bad of cramps.  Sunday and morning were definitely worse days than today.  She has not had a  menstrual cycle in over 15 years, she is 60.  She did not take anything for the pain.  She is still having the symptoms, and actually worse than it was earlier.
