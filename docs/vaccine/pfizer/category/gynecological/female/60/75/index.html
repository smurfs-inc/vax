A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away. The pain was passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area at one point went away but she still have nausea and diarrhea and they gave her more fluids and sent her home. They didn&#39;t really want to address the vaginal bleeding. Patient have not been back and was not sure if she is still dehydrated. Patient was still pushing fluids and still not back to normal. Patient&#39;s daughter told her that since it was 5 days later it was not a reaction. Patient was thinking maybe it was an allergic internal severe reaction. Patient was weighing 130 pounds but lost about 4 pounds during this illness, so 4 pounds lighter. She stated her daughter-in-law was doing research and found a blog and there are woman the caller&#39;s age complaining of these symptoms (unexplained bleeding) after the vaccine. She asked if this was from the vaccine. She stated she was so sick that if there is even a chance then she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She asked if this is a coincidence or has it been reported. She stated she is trying to make a decision on if she should get the second dose because she heard other people have symptoms and take the second shot. The outcome of the events passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area, headache, a sharp pain in her side, passing blood in her urine, passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area/vaginal bleeding was recovered on Apr2021, while for the other events, it was unknown.
