It happened on and off, for two days then stopped.  No cramping or other symptoms.  When I read that this had happened to some patients, I thought I&#39;d better report my occurence too.  No treatment or doctor visit necessary.  It was just a surprise .

Hurts to touch my left breast area and the pain is a shooting pain that is constant and feels like a stabbing pain.  Hurts to move my left arm.  I&#39;ve been taking 3 Advil at a time and the pain subsides for a couple of hours but comes back.  It doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m sitting up or lying down the pain is always there.  I sometimes feel like I&#39;ve had the wind knocked out of me when the pain radiates to the front of my chest area. There is no longer any pain at the injection site.

About 27 hours after receiving the second shot, what appears to be a menstrual cycle began.  I last had my period in 2015.  For additional context, I have a history of fibroids and still have a good sized one.  In late February I had a spotting issue but what I&#39;m experiencing now is a full on period.  I was already in contact with my PCP and an OB/GYN for testing related to the Feb. spotting event and as a result of that will be having an endometrial biopsy and hysteroscopy.  Outside of the above, I had a sore arm and bruising at the injection site.  Thank you

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 10Mar2021, as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia (diagnosed in 1996), ongoing allergies from 1981, ongoing food allergies and chemical allergies, ongoing allergy to alcohol, ongoing hypothyroidism from 2012, ongoing pre-diabetic from 2012, Lyme disease for 11 years before being correctly diagnosed and treated, concussion in Sep2019, and post concussion syndrome in Sep2019. The patient previously took nalbuphine hydrochloride (NUBAIN) in 1981 and experienced anaphylaxis; and paracetamol (TYLENOL) and was very sensitive, had rash and high blood pressure. Within the first 15 to 20 minutes following the administration of the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, on 10Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face and ears got very red, flushed, and itchy. The patient reported that she is allergic to alcohol and thought maybe it was the glycol in the COVID-19 vaccine that caused the reaction. She reported that she has had glycol before and has never reacted quite like that. The flushing, redness, and itchiness of her face and ears subsided within an hour and were gone by 4 hours. Her allergist instructed her to take 2 Zyrtec before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. After her face and ears became flushed, red, and itchy, she ended up having a really bad headache that continued until the next day. Her headache was severe for about 12 hours and continued for a total of a day and a half.  She stated that her headache was more like a migraine during the 12 hours when it was severe. It felt like a migraine, but worse. On 10Mar2021, the patient reported that she experienced flu-like symptoms like being nauseous, had dizziness, achiness all over, and was not feeling well, her post-concussion syndrome was triggered and had more headaches, dizziness, nausea. She reported that things have been going awry in her body since she had the COVID-19 vaccine. She reported that the increase in headaches seemed to have improved, but the nausea and dizziness have in some ways improved and then some days it feels like &#34;here we go again&#34; when it hits. About a week after she received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, in Mar2021, the patient noticed a change in her urination. It wasn&#39;t severe or anything at that point, she just felt like she was not able to release the urine (urine retention). She thought to increase her intake to see if it would help her urinate and it didn&#39;t seem to help much. She received a prescription on 26Mar2021, and during that week, she noticed that she was having more issues with some burning during urination and was developing pelvic pain and pressure. The patient stated that the scent and color of her urine looked fine.  She reported that the frequency started to increase with not much urine coming out. When she finished her antibiotics about 7 days later, the urine retention had really improved and went away at the end of March. In the morning of 26Mar2021, when the patient woke up, she had blood in her urine and clots. The clots were about the size of a pea and a couple were about the size of a dime. The blood and blood clots in her urine were what made her go to the doctor. She reported she has never had blood in her urine that she remembers. She was put on Macrobid for 5 days. She reported that Macrobid wasn&#39;t relieving enough of her symptoms and her provider ended up adding a couple more days. The patient reported feeling more worn out in Mar2021, since she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This did not improve and some days it was worse. The patient did not have the energy level and stamina that she used to (Mar2021). She reported that whether it&#39;s combined with the retriggering of her post-concussion syndrome, it is significant for her life. She was also not eating well and had lost some weight (Mar2021). She reported that her appetite is improving but it is still not normal for her. She mentioned it was harder for her to want to eat something because of feeling nauseated. The patient assessed the events &#34;face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy&#34;, headache, &#34;headache was more like a migraine/felt like a migraine, but worse&#34;, &#34;post concussion syndrome was retriggered&#34;, &#34;blood in her urine and clots&#34;, &#34;not eating well and had lost some weight&#34; and &#34;feeling more worn out&#34; as serious (medically significant). The patient recovered from &#34;face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy&#34; and &#34;she is allergic to alcohol and thought maybe it was the glycol in the COVID-19 vaccine that caused the reaction&#34; on 10Mar2021; headache, &#34;headache was more like a migraine/felt like a migraine, but worse&#34;, &#34;she was not able to release the urine (urine retention)&#34;, &#34;blood in her urine and clots&#34;, &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;, dizziness, &#34;achiness all over&#34;, &#34;pelvic pain and pressure&#34;, and &#34;some burning during urination&#34; in Mar2021; and was recovering from &#34;not eating well and had lost some weight&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient assessed the causality of events headache, flu like symptoms, nausea, &#34;face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy&#34;, dizziness, &#34;post concussion syndrome was retriggered&#34;, and &#34;not eating well and had lost some weight&#34; as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information in the case report and a plausible temporal association, A possible causal relationship between urinary retention, hemorrhage urinary tract and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

The spotting turned into a full-on period, lasted 6 days, and came back again the following month.  I had called my GYN and she tested me for cancer etc. and put me on progesterone, however that seems to not be working just yet.  Most of all this is super annoying.

Some tenderness in left upper arm.  About a week later (April 1) I had left upper back  &amp; chest pain  (just left of thoracic spine area and forward to left of my sternum bone &amp; left shoulder pain). The area of discomfort increased to under my left armpit. I used Tylenol every 4 hours but still had some pain.  The pain was bad enough that I had trouble sleeping  at night and reaching for objects in my home.  I noticed an &#34;engorged&#34; feeling &amp; tenderness in my left breast.  Swollen lymph nodes were present under my left arm - breast was too tender to check for more lymph nodes.  No fever.  Wasn&#39;t sure if I should go to an ER so checked the internet &amp; 4/14/21 Contacted &amp; consulted with my family doctor (Dr - My Chart messages) to let her know.  Found information on Web (internet) that some women are having this kind of reaction in lymph nodes so was less worried about something more serious like a heart attack).  Afternoon of 4/15 and today 4/16 feel the symptoms are beginning to go away - pain in my axilla area is better, lymph nodes not as hard &amp; tender,  left  breast and left side of backbone have decreased discomfort.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away. The pain was passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area at one point went away but she still have nausea and diarrhea and they gave her more fluids and sent her home. They didn&#39;t really want to address the vaginal bleeding. Patient have not been back and was not sure if she is still dehydrated. Patient was still pushing fluids and still not back to normal. Patient&#39;s daughter told her that since it was 5 days later it was not a reaction. Patient was thinking maybe it was an allergic internal severe reaction. Patient was weighing 130 pounds but lost about 4 pounds during this illness, so 4 pounds lighter. She stated her daughter-in-law was doing research and found a blog and there are woman the caller&#39;s age complaining of these symptoms (unexplained bleeding) after the vaccine. She asked if this was from the vaccine. She stated she was so sick that if there is even a chance then she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She asked if this is a coincidence or has it been reported. She stated she is trying to make a decision on if she should get the second dose because she heard other people have symptoms and take the second shot. The outcome of the events passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area, headache, a sharp pain in her side, passing blood in her urine, passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area/vaginal bleeding was recovered on Apr2021, while for the other events, it was unknown.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included echocardiogram normal: normal  on unknown date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bronchitis , heart rate high.  The clinical course was reported as follows: Caller received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 09 MAR 2021. Caller states the past couple of months she has experienced a lot of adverse events. Caller states she has had issues with bronchitis and went to a pulmonologists and cardiologists and she has been put on 27 different medications. Caller states after all of these things going on she is not sure if she should receive the second dose. Caller states one doctor told her she should not receive the second dose and one doctor told her she should. Caller would like to know if she should receive the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Caller states her doctor doesn&#39;t want to tell her what to do because she thinks he is afraid that she might sue him. Caller thought that by calling Pfizer she would get some advice but she is getting nowhere. Caller would like to know if she can receive the Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine as her second dose instead of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine? Had the vaccine 9Mar2021 and is just recovering now. Last week, she was finally feeling like herself. She had some medical conditions that put her at risk. She is 65 and is afraid to get the second shot but is also afraid to not get the second shot. Her doctor thinks it is too coincidental that this happened right after the vaccine. Has been talking to a lot of doctors. Is afraid to get the second vaccination. So now, she is just trying to figure it out. It really knocked her out, she has had 27 medications, she&#39;s been to the ER 3 times, been to the doctor 7 times, it just really knocked her out, they first thought it was a heart condition, then a lung condition. Has been having rashes and all kinds of stuff. Is afraid to not get the second dose. One of her doctors recommended the Johnson &amp; Johnson, but is that safe, no. Weight was about 200 pounds. Started 5 days after the vaccine. Fever: On Sunday, started to get a fever. It was on and off all day. She thought it was a normal reaction and didn&#39;t think much of it. It was weird. It would be like 20 minutes and then fine, and would be off an on all day. It was a low grade fever, never more than 100. she felt hot and cold all day. It was most of Sunday and stopped in the evening. Treatment: none. Swelling and pain under breasts, under armpits and in lymph nodes: Started Monday. Breasts were tender as well as if like she was having a period. There was pain underneath her arm and in the lymph nodes. Lasted for 2 days. Treatment was none. Felt like bronchitis: On Tuesday, it started to get what she thought was bronchitis. She has a propensity to get bronchitis. She hasn&#39;t gotten sick  in 2 years. She immediately went to the doctor. This went on for 2 months. Treatment: They prescribed Prednisone, nebulizers and antibiotics which she finished everything 3 weeks ago. She couldn&#39;t sleep and had to sleep sitting up, she couldn&#39;t lay down, it started right away when she felt she had the bronchitis. Rash up and down and all over her arms: She then developed a reaction and had a rash up and down her arms, all over her arms. Felt the bronchitis symptoms right away. It was the weirdest thing and she couldn&#39;t lay down. Every time she would get up, she couldn&#39;t breathe. Went to the emergency room 3 times but was not admitted.  At one point, she had a rash all over her body. Her doctor thought it was MRSA. This happened a month into all of this. She got the vaccine 8 or 9 Mar 2021. This rash occurred some time in mid April. When it started, the rash was everywhere in her body. It was so severe, that they thought it was MRSA. Gave her another bout of antibiotics. She had sores that were opening all over her body. She then went to the Emergency room and they treated her there. The other time she went to the emergency room because she couldn&#39;t breathe. She had to sit in a Lazy boy chair for 2 months. The pulmonologist and the heart doctor couldn&#39;t find anything. When they though it was bronchitis, they treated her for 2 months with Prednisone. She got Candida&#39;s from the Prednisone. They put her on 27 medications total. The pulmonologist said it was not the lungs, it was the heart. She was put on medication to slow down the heart rate. It had been running about 119. The medication she was put on was Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. It slows down the heart rate, it has been so high. She was put on the medication 23 Apr 2021. It went so high. Her oxygen has been good. Her heart rate was never slowing down. She is still taking the Metoprolol, her rate is running like 118 and 108, it never slows down. The pulmonologist said it was not the lungs, its the heart and she is going to see him tomorrow for a follow up echo. She is so sick from so many medicines. Is still experiencing a lot of tiredness. It is the weirdest and is very strange. When she was laying down and couldn&#39;t breathe, the doctor said they felt like she was going into heart failure. The Echo didn&#39;t find anything wrong. It was a weird thing.  She talked to both of the doctors, the pulmonologist and the family doctor who said that it was too coincidental that it was from the Pfizer. The Echo was a week and a half ago. The family doctor read it sand it looked normal. The pulmonologist who ordered the test is going to check it tomorrow. Her family doctor said to not get the second shot. The other doctor said she could probably take it. She doesn&#39;t feel like herself. She is scared. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Event bronchitis like symptoms required a visit to Emergency Room for 3 times and Physician Office and has been to the family doctor at least 5 times. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) but had the flu shot in the fall. AE following prior vaccinations was none. Relevant Tests was none or Unknown. Caller states that she is overweight. Caller states that she is trying to get out of here to go to a doctors appointment. Caller states that she has the bottle, she will ask her spouse to read it since she can see better, the product is Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. On the bottle it also described the pill as Round white tablet 51:M18. Caller needs to obtain a magnifying glass. Caller states that she wants to give enough information to what happen to her. She states that the Manufacture is Mylan.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

She went to sleep at around 11:00 AM, and got up around 7:00 and as soon as she woke up she could feel the lump under her arm.  It was a little smaller than a baseball, soft, cystic like.  I couldn&#39;t put her arm down, had to keep her hand on the hip due to this.  The following day the left breast started to feel funny and hurting, but cannot feel a lump but it feels swollen and went up into the shoulder and neck.  She cannot turn her neck as if she has a crick in it.  She had a headache for a couple of days on and off, and then it goes away.  She has taken the arthritis Tylenol.  She has called her doctor and told her to take the Tylenol as needed.

                                                I did fine until 5 days later when I had postmenopausal spotting on 4/3/21.  It was very light, but abnormal.  The next day, 4/4/21, I went to the ER, since it started being a little more than spotting.  I had an U/S.  The PA said I may have uterine and/or ovarian cancer.  I saw a gynecologist who didn&#39;t think I had cancer.  He was unable to do an in-office biopsy, so scheduled a D&amp;C.  The biopsy was non diagnostic, since he was unable to get a sufficient tissue sample.  The spotting had stopped approx on 4/8/21.  The Dr can&#39;t say for sure whether it is related to the vaccine or not.  I had gone through menopause at 51.  I turned 66 on 4/3/21.  The Dr will repeat an U/S in a month.

Course also complicated by saddle submassive PE w/ &#43; biomarkers and mild RHS.  Given unclear etiology of thrombocytopenia, venous thrombosis, and PE, suspect a precipitating/underlying etiology and cannot rule out possible occult malignancy, autoimmune disorder or alternative hypercoagulable state such as APLS. Possibly bacteremic given GPB and Staph on blood cx, though likely contaminant. DKA resolved, anion gap is closed, continued monitoring of glucose and insulin adjustment .OB/Gyn following for heavy vaginal bleeding and possibly gyn malignancy workup, endometrial biopsy pending.

                                                Mid day on April 2, I suddenly developed vaginal bleeding then within 8 hours bleeding stopped. In the meantime, that afternoon I went to see Dr.  and I was still bleeding when I went there. He did a biopsy and scheduled me to get a Vaginal ultrasound the next week. He also gave me some hormonal pills but my bleeding had stopped. For the next 25 days, I had no spotting, no bleeding or anything at all. At around noon time, on April 26, I began bleeding again but this time it wasn&#39;t bright red but it was a light brown color. By that afternoon, it had stopped. In the next 5 days, I had similar episodes but it got very light until it faded. Later on May 17, I had a very light yellowish brown discharge. Since then, this has been it.

A 69-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in Arm Right on 19Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN620P) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Medical history included Diabetic from 1995 and ongoing, blood pressure high from 1995 and ongoing (just took her usual medications); eczema from 2014. Family medical history relevant to AEs was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 26Feb2021 (Lot Number: EX9266) for COVID-19 immunisation; took the shingles shot and broke out they claimed that she had topical eczema. She thinks it was from the shot. That was in 2014. After the second or third day, her face on the right side became numb-like and it went to the other side on 22Mar2021. And now, on her head and on her body, it felt like a sun burn or wind burn. She took Benadryl and it is not going away. She didn&#39;t know if it was from the shot. It started 3 days after she had it on 19Mar2021. It started on the third day in her face and seemed to work its way down. Her right breast was swollen on Mar2021, and her daughter took the shot and got deathly sick, her right side was swollen to 3 times its size on her breast. She didn&#39;t swell that much and hers has gone down now. Her arms are really tender like sunburn or wind burn. As long as she is sitting still it doesn&#39;t bother her but if her clothes hit it or anything it is annoying. She didn&#39;t know if other people have complained about that. The patient stated it hurt on her head, like a sunburn. She said there was no numbness, it was more like a sunburn. It doesn&#39;t hurt unless touched, like her bra rubbing against it and agitating it. She didn&#39;t have this until she had the shot. She got the shot on 19Mar2021, and about 22Mar2021 it started with her face first. It worked its way down her body. It was about a week later that it spread to other parts of her body. She waited about calling because every day she thought it would be getting better. but it hasn&#39;t. she took Benadryl for a sunburn-type feeling on her body and it hasn&#39;t helped. She had not received any other treatment. There no AEs require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She had a physical done in between her first and second dose. She had routine bloodwork. Outcome of the event right breast was swollen was recovered, of the other events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                On the day of the vaccination, March 27, 2021, I had a sore arm and a headache. The next day I was lethargic and felt mild chills. These seemed like flu-type symptoms. On the third day, March 19, I felt fine during the day, but by 10 pm, my breasts were warm and hurting. Over the next 5 days they got much worse. My nipples were noticeably swollen, hot to the touch, and so sore that I couldn&#39;t wear a bra or a blouse that pressed on my skin. Overnight I had discharge from my left nipple (about 1/4 teaspoon worth on my night clothes); this occurred again on the next night. By the 5th day, my breasts felt mostly back to normal.

                                                Lymph nodes under Right arm swelled and it was painful down my whole arm.  Swelling and pain was even into the right side of my breast.  I also had some loose stool.  These lasted about 2 weeks.  I used ice packs under my arm and on my breast and that helped quite a bit.  The swelling went down a bit every day but was still a bit painful.  I still have a bit of pain but nothing extreme like before.  I had no fever, nausea, or pain in any other part of my body.

Normally active, flexible, healthy, mentally alert, more like a 50 year old. Weight appropriate for height. Eat well and pay attention to staying healthy. Don&#39;t like taking medication, so only took one tylenol when temp got to 100.8.
