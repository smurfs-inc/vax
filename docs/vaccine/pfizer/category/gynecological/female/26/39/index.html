The next morning I woke up and felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I had an immobilizing migraine, full body aches, I could hardly eat and get out of bed, I also had a mild fever and mild cough. That only lasted about a day and a half.  I didn?t find it necessary to seek medical attention and just took some ibuprofen to help ease symptoms. After both doses I noticed some light spotting the two days after.  Also I did just have a baby in November but I am not breastfeeding. I work in a Pharmacy and they got me the vaccine before I returned from maternity leave.

                                                I ended up starting my period April 20, 2020 (same day I got the vaccine) and it was the heaviest cycle I&#39;ve had in years. I went through several tampons in a day for about a week til my period abruptly stopped on April 26, 2020.  It started about 2 hours after the vaccination. I usually don&#39;t cramp but I was having problems sleeping because of how bad it got. I was also more bloated than my usual cycles. I dealt with extreme fatigue, I slept a lot that week and I did the bare minimum that week at work (which is unusual for me).  I also don&#39;t usually have mood swings but I felt like my hormones were a bit intense to the point I kept snapping at people even though I like to think of myself as level-headed.

After the second dose it?s extended my period and made it extremely heavy, having lots of clots in my cycle,  still having tingling and numbness in my right forearm, tingling/ itching in my ears, very tired all day. The main concern is that with the vaccine I?m of day 17 of my period and it doesn?t seem to be slowing down just getting heavier.

The patient returned in 21 days and received her 2nd dose of the vaccine and began to experience heavy clots and blood loss again along with headaches, paleness, and weakness. The patient saw a physician and was given medroxyprogesterone to decrease the bleeding on 4/15/2021. On 4/28/2021 the patient reported to an ER and was given a transfusion due to low iron levels.

A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8727)  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 26-year-old, on 27Mar2021 15:00, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypothyroidism, obesity, dysmenorrhea, moderate cramping and fatigue. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan and levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN). The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EN6205) at left arm, at the age of 26-year-old, on 06Mar2021 13:00, for covid-19 immunisation. The morning before the vaccine, early period symptoms had begun reported as moderate cramping and fatigue. The patient waited 8 hours after vaccine to take Naproxen Sodium 540mg (a usual dosage for my usual period symptoms to be taken every 8 hours). On 28Mar2021, the day after vaccine, the patient saw some spotting but reduction in period symptoms. Three days after vaccine, the patient saw very heavy bleeding (around 50 mL fluid each day over 3 days using a menstrual cup), intense cramps even with 540mg naproxen, and fatigue that required sleeping most of the day. While this combination of symptoms is a normal occurrence for the patient, the symptoms this time is at a greater magnitude than normal, and these symptoms came in and out over five days from start of bleeding, three days longer than is normal for the patient. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 07Apr2021. Outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.

Physically noticed symptoms in early February 2021. Symptoms did not improve so scheduled a clinic visit. Lab tests revealed critical low H&amp;H with no signs of hepatic malfunction or disease. ER visit and consultation with hematologist pointed to diagnosis of Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. No family history of autoimmune disease, no previous history of condition, no previous cancer, no prescription medication. Suspect that the vaccine caused condition. Current treatment is high dose prednisone. Treatment ongoing.

Taken to ER (shot was down at local hospital) and given some antihistamines and felt fine afterwards.  2nd shot - No reaction right away like the first one, migraine for 2 days, went away. Main concern though is that my period is currently 2 weeks late after I received my second shot. I have taken multiple pregnancy tests and they all came back negative. Apparently a bunch of my friends have had the same side effect but they told me it comes back after a month. I?m surprise that this isn?t listed as one of the side effects of the vaccine. I was ready for the side effects listed but when I haven?t had my period I was worried and didn?t realize other women were having this side effect also.  I feel this should be told to women in order for them to prepare that this could be a side effect. Also it?s not just me, apparently there?s been a ton of woman about it on the internet talking about it and many of my personal friends have the same experience. Please be more open about side effects with women?s bodies.

                                                My last period started Tuesday Feb 2nd and did not stop until 14 days later, more than double my usual menstrual cycle. It seemed pretty normal and painless, but then on 8th day I was surprised to find myself still bleeding . It was a darker color around then, but then became brighter and I noticed myself passing clots when I went to the restroom that were loose, but about the size of a quarter or half dollar. I did not bleed through any menstrual pads, but the return of bright red after it being a darker red that im used to at the end of a period had me concerned. I was in slight discomfort around my uterus/bowels and I couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s my body recovering from the vaccine, or something else.  I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 2/11/21 (Pfizer) and stayed home from work as I had a fever/headache/chills (this was not unexpected to me, my coworkers had the same symptoms).

We were able to delay delivery for about 24 hours but she did deliver at 25 weeks 0 days.  Earlier in her pregnancy she had some vaginal spotting (last time was on 1/15/21 and her cervix was closed on sonogram).  In her first trimester she had significant hyperemesis treated with medication and IV fluids but this resolved after the first trimester.

                                                At time of vaccine (04/07 11:45 AM) was light-headed and had shoulder pain at injection site but no other adverse effects during observation period.  While driving home, had some tingling/numbness in left arm and knees with persistent pain in shoulder.   Felt fine other than shoulder pain and slight headache until that night. I went running after finishing work (around 7 pm) and started experiencing intense tingling/numbness all down left arm to hand as well as intense knee pain not typical during running, at which point I stopped running and went home. When I got home I noticed my left index finger had lost circulation (was white).   That night I experienced moderate but increasing fatigue as well as chest pain and tightness. My hands both felt numb like they fell asleep/lost circulation, as well as my left arm and feet.   The next morning I felt better but the fatigue and numbness in my hands and feet started up again around 10 am and lasted for several hours. I had some chest pain that night (around 11 pm) and a headache on and off throughout the day.   Today (04/09) I felt completely fine. I did start my period the day before my vaccine (04/06) and was having heavy bleeding/cramps that day and a bit throughout the time described above.

                                                After receiving the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, I had severe flu symptoms (chills, nausea, body aches, cold sweats, migraine, fatigue) starting about 7 hours after the injection and lasting for approximately 20 hours.  The evet that I was primarily concerned about was that, about a week after the vaccine, I started my menstrual cycle and got a period. My IUD has prevented me from having a period for 2.5 years, and so it was alarming to get one suddenly out of nowhere. While this was obviously not a life threatening event by any means, I wanted to report because of how unusual it was so that if other women are having this experience (or any changes in their menstrual cycle) there will be appropriate documentation to list it as a side effect, and help alleviate anxiety by informing women this is a possibility following being vaccinated.

                                                Once my period started, (somewhat on schedule) I had terrible period cramps. Worse than I&#39;ve ever had before. I very rarely get cramps at all, and these were certainly the worse I&#39;ve ever had. Pain was bad enough to prevent my ability to work and to some extent move at times. This is not something I have ever experienced before. Reporting because I have heard anecdotally from  close friends about changes in their periods after the vaccine as well. I had not heard of this until after I was already done with my period, so it wasn&#39;t something I was expecting  or in my opinion not placebo related since I did not hear about possible period-related side effects until afterwards.

I received my 2nd COVID vaccine last week and now my period is 5 days late. I&#39;m not pregnant. My period hasn&#39;t been this late in the last 15 years. It seems likely that this is a vaccine side effect? I decided to report it just in case!

I typically do not have mensural cramps during my cycle but I had cramping that was so painful on the night of April 13th I could not sleep. It was excruciating pain. I had to medicate with motrin in order to get a few hours of sleep that night.

                                                My first menstrual cycle following the vaccine was extremely heavy, with a lot of fatigue. I have never lost that much blood menstruating in the past, and at one point I briefly passed out due to the combination of fatigue and weakness from the blood loss. While it could be coincidence, I&#39;ve never had a cycle like that before and figured it might be something that needed to be brought up.

It was like half of my body was asleep, like when your arm or foot goes to sleep, that was the feeling on my right side. Everything was normal on the left side.  Woke up the next morning and my migraine started, I kept a migraine for the next 4 days.  3 Days later I started getting feeling back everywhere except my shoulder blade and arm. Once I regained most the feeling I had cramps where I would normally have menstral cramps.  Thursday 5/13 I started spotting. It was more of a flow and stopped by Sunday afternoon.  as of Tuesday 5/18 my right arm has a little feeling but it comes and goes mainly my upper arm and shoulder are numb still.

                                                The night following my first dose, I experienced the worst mentrual cramping I have ever had in my life, so much so that it felt like I was having contractions.  As I have an IUD, I have not had a period for over two years now, though I do experience cramps during the time in my cycle where I should bleed. The cramps experienced were nothing like my normal menstrual cramps, I was doubled over in pain. And on the third day after the shot, I bled for the first time in 2 years (since getting an IUD). My breasts also doubled in size and extremely painful.

The fatigue and headache lasted two days, but all of those side effects were minor and manageable and are well worth it to avoid covid-19. A couple days after I got the shot, I got my period and it was nine days early. That never happens to me. My cycle is pretty regular and is never early. I additionally experienced much heavier bleeding than usual as well as worse cramps.

                                                Vaginal bleeding began 4 days after my covid shot on  May 11th and is still continuing to this day, June 11th.  I passed 4 blood clots between the days May 28 and June 5th. On May 28 and May 29, I was bleeding uncontrollably from my vagina and having to changing pads and pants every two hours. THIS DOES NOT REFLECT MY NORMAL CYCLE OR PERIOD  Next, perfectly healthy before May 11th and this covid shot i had to undergo appendix surgery and had to get my appendix removed, and during surgery it ruptured in my doctors hands. Before this shot, I was a completely healthy and active 27 year old female.

                                                A few weeks after my second injection, I had a very heavy period. I?ve had a period every 2 weeks since the first incident and I?ve never had that problem in my life. In fact, I have the opposite problem where I very rarely get periods, so having them every 2 weeks is completely out of the ordinary for me.

                                                During my first period after receiving the vaccine, I experienced markedly worse menstrual cramps than usual throughout the day. I took Midol extra strength to combat the pain. I couldn&#39;t sleep until approximately 2:30 am, and I woke up at 4:00am due to the pain. I noticed that my vagina itself was swollen on the inside and essentially numb - even as my abdomen was cramping painfully. After sitting in the bathroom for a while, I tried to stand. At that point, I briefly passed out and collapsed into the bathtub. This has never happened before in my life.

I have been on the same birth control for 11 years and this has never happened. I did not miss a pill or take one late. I had extreme cramping within 24 hours of the first vaccine. The day after the cramping started, I had the heaviest period I&#39;ve had since I began birth control 11 years ago.

                                                The week after vaccination I was admitted into the hospital for severe menstrual bleeding. My CBC result shows a platelet count of 17 10*3/uL, accompanied by low white blood cell and red blood cells count. I received multiple transfusions (2 units of whole blood and one unit of platelets), and was diagnosed with ITP.  I then received steroid treatment (Dexamethasone, 40mg/day,  4days), after which my blood counts are restored.

My last period was on December 8th and I received the vaccine on Dec 30th. I developed a fever and muscle aches after the first dose, but was managed with Tylenol.  I received the second dose on January 22nd and again developed a fever that was managed by Tylenol. I began having vaginal bleeding on 24th. I had an ultrasound revealing a heartbeat on the 25th. After continually bleeding, another ultrasound a week later on Feb. 2nd confirmed a miscarriage. I&#39;ve had two healthy pregnancies prior to this one.

                                                Heavy vaginal bleeding noticed a few hours after injection. I have been spotting (1 pad daily) because of my birth control, but now I?m using 6-7 pads a day and soaking through them. I?m not sure if it?s related but I?m also extremely fatigued and having chills.  Should I ask for a blood test for my platelet count?  I?ve read it is a very rare reaction for some to have lower counts.

During following cycle, no clear sign of ovulation per  tracking. Currently on day 43 of my cycle and have taken 3 negative pregnancy tests. Period was expected to start 3/19/2021.

                                                Very heavy menstrual bleeding; lots of blood clotting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A non-pregnant 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Mar2021 at 05:45 PM (17:45), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergies to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included collagen, krill oil, and ethinylestradiol/ etonogestrel (NUVARING). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in a pharmacy or drug store. On 26Mar2021, the patient had a very heavy menstrual bleeding which she had never experienced prior; there was no cramping but lots of blood clotting. No treatment was received for the adverse event. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had not recovered from the event.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I was about 4 weeks and 3 days pregnant when I received my second dose of the vaccine.  Everything seemed fine. The next day I woke up and I no longer &#34;felt pregnant&#34;, but it was my first pregnancy so I did not think too much of it. Thursday I started having spotting and asked my doctor to do another BETA to see if my HCG levels were ok. That night I got the call that my levels had dropped and that I was losing the baby. I started heavily bleeding the next day. I have also had extreme back and muscle pain after each dose.

This continued for 2-3 days; with dark clots, with every wiping, and on underwear. Her menstrual cycle had finished for 8-9 days.

                                                The day after I got my first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine, I started an extremely heavy period during a time when I shouldn&#39;t have had a period. The bleeding did not stop but was slowing down when I got my second dose. After the second dose, the bleeding started getting heavy again and has not stopped. I have a doctor&#39;s appointment next week. I&#39;m reporting this because I saw some news articles where other women are having unusual bleeding from the Covid vaccines.

On March 25 or March 26 (I cannot remember exactly which day here) I started spotting, and then by the next day I was bleeding. On March 29 I saw my OBGYN who diagnosed me with a miscarriage. I continued to bleed for approximately 10 days, as well as dizziness, and feeling very faint. I have had 2 very healthy pregnancies in the past and no health issues. This could be absolutely unrelated, as early miscarriages are almost impossible to pinpoint, but I did feel this should be reported for researching purposes.

I&#39;ve never taken any feminine birth control and have always had a very, very regular and reliable period. But this go around I was experience heavy bleeding and cramps right away rather than a few days in. Even now after five days, I my period would normally be tapering off and the blood would be changing to light pink in color. Yet, I&#39;m still experiencing bright red blood.

                                                Irregular menstrual cycle. Breakthrough bleeding/spotting starting 3 days after vaccine.  Bleeding comes intermittently &amp; is randomly heavy then stops. Seems like I?m on my period every 2 hours or so. Not due for the start of period for 1.5 weeks from today. Usually VERY regular and have never once had spotting before. 0% chance of pregnancy at the time of vaccine or currently.

                                                Within 7 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started what I thought was my second period of the month. I had just finished a period 12 days earlier. I am usually 35 - 42 days between periods so this was VERY unusual for me. I had my normal period pre-vaccine Jan 4 - 9 then 7 hours after the vaccine started bleeding again from the 21-25 of January. Then again on Feb 4 - 9. I got my second vaccine while bleeding. Then again started to bleed on Feb 21 - 25. I had a doctors appointment at the end of February. I got an annual gyno exam as well as a ton of bloodwork was taken to check everything out. I was told to continue to monitor the bleeding and if it didn&#39;t stop we would do a pelvic ultrasound. Well, it didn&#39;t stop so we did and it came back normal. I had a mostly normal March with light bleeding. I thought perhaps it was getting better but no. I have had two periods in April. In fact still bleeding on round two and this is my 6th day bleeding. Periods or irregular bleeding was April 12-17 and then again on April 24 - 29 (still happening and it&#39;s the 29th). This is very scary to me as no doctors can help.

Within 24 hours after the first vaccine, I was bleeding enough to need a pad changed every few hours. I experienced all symptoms that I typically have during my period - uterine cramping, lower back pain, &amp; a loss of appetite. After 48 hours, the bleeding has stopped and I?m no longer having symptoms similar to a period.   I?ve had an IUD for over a year &amp; have never had break through bleeding or spotting. Additionally, this was heavier than slight spotting - it felt as if I had started a new period.

                                                I ended my last period on April 20th. I got my first Pfizer shot on April 27th. I got my period on May 7th, over a week early than I should have and it is very heavy bleeding, more than normal, with severe cramping and fatigue. I am not on any form of birth control, and I am not sexually active. My period has never come early this far in advance. I also wasn&#39;t under any particular stress during that time period, or experiencing any unusual sleep patterns. Today is May 10th and I am still bleeding heavily. I may add another entry if the bleeding goes on for longer than my normal period. I also will be visiting my obgyn this afternoon.

OTC pain medication easily reduced my mild symptoms. 48 hours after the 2nd vaccine, I started spotting and experiencing strong menstrual cramps for about 15 minutes. During this time, the cramps felt very severe - a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale. I almost felt like I might throw up from the pain. But then it subsided to a 5 and took Midol and applied heat. The cramps returned at 5:00 pm.  Date of last cycle was approx 5/23. I don?t spot, so this stood out to me.

                                                Upon receiving my first shot, I felt weak, and after a few days a tingly feeling in my head. Symptoms lasted for 2 weeks. After receiving the second dose, I had a fever that evening and weakness, it lasted through the next day. My right arm was sore for 2 days.  I took Advil, Tylenol, and ibuprofen (at different times). Symptoms of fever lasted two days and were gone, I was left feeling weak, it lasted for a day.  Now day 5 after I got my shot (got the last dose 1/22/2021), I have noticed some vaginal bleeding that has been going on for 2 days now (It&#39;s not the menstrual period since I had that going on a week before I got my last shot). I am wondering if there are any other women who have experienced the same reaction to their body. Kindly feel free to call me or email me with any answers. I am trying to reach my primary physician who is currently booked till February.

Approximately 8 hours following, I began feeling sluggish &amp; global muscle soreness. I slept that evening with Tylenol in my system(1000mg)  and then awakened the next morning with swollen &amp; tender axillary nodes in my right upper extremity.

January 31st morning I awoke and continued to have the swollen, tender axillary nodes with progression of swelling into my right breast and down into my right elbow area. I again alternated NSAIDs with no improvement except for lying supine with my RUE elevated toward the ceiling. Monday morning I continued to have the same above symptoms and Tuesday my RUE is swelling into my hand intermittently with continued tenderness &amp; swollen axillary nodes.

                                                I experienced an early menstrual cycle after the first shot with very light flow. Two weeks after the second shot, I am experiencing very heavy flow compared to normal, and had moderate period cramps on the first day of menstruation. This is atypical as my cycles are usually cramp-free with moderate flow. I also experienced additional fatigue on the first day of my cycle.

                                                Developed acute-onset, sharp right pelvic/groin pain radiating to right groin and flank the day after receiving first Pfizer COVID vaccine.   Non-contrast CT abd/pelv revealed right ovarian cyst which resolved on follow-up vaginal ultrasound 1 week later.  Within about 2 days, the sharp pain progressed to burning neuropathic-type pain across the pelvic/pubic region and down bilateral inner thighs to knee level.  Pain was constant.  After 10-14 days, the pain transitioned from burning sensation to sensation of feeling cold (both on skin and deep tissues) that would feel normal to the touch.  It is symmetric on both sides and begins at the level of umbilicus and involves both groins and medial thighs. Symptoms worsen with sitting or standing up for prolonged periods of time (and become more noticeable/bothersome) and as the day progresses.  About 2 weeks later, the severe burning pain progressed to include bilateral buttocks and outer thighs as well.  MRI brain/cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine largely normal (tarlov cysts S2-S3, small left disc protrusion C5-C6).  CBC, BMP, TSH, B12, B6, lyme titer, ESR normal.  Currently being treated with gabapentin 300mg TID.

                                                My menstrual cycle  was late by 2 weeks and I had the most *severe* cramping of my life. It began at 5:00 am with low to moderate levels of cramping. By 6:30 am I was fully awake and waiting for the local CVS to open at 8 am so I could purchase ibruprofen. (I NEVER have to take ibruprofen due to cramping).  I ate food before I took 200 mg - an hour later my symptoms had progressed to include doubling over in pain and nausea at which I ate a little more food and took 400 mg more (total 600 mg). At 600 mgs my symptoms abated enough for me to eat a small breakfast (10 am). 4 hours later the nausea and severve doubling over with pain cramps returned which is when I ate more food at took another 600 mgs of ibruprofen.  I went to bed at 7pm that night (usual bed time is 9:30)  I used ibruprofen to manage my symptoms all that first day ? the next day I was exhausted from feeling so beat up the day before but thankfully no more cramping or nausea. Today is day 3 and I am feeling back to myself.   I would just like to reiterate that I have NEVER in my life had a period this severe in cramping or nausea.

The pain lasted for about an hour where I was unable to lay down, sit up or stand up without convulsing. There were muscle spasms, exhibited lots of shivering and cold. I treated this with Tylenol and it did not help immediately. After the hour I was able to lay down and go to sleep with the pelvic area still sore but not in as much pain as previously stated. The next two days I exhibited soreness in the pelvic and ovary areas. Currently I am experiencing no pain.

My last period prior to this was on April 30th and I started to get spotting on May 13th, 9 days after my first covid shot. After 2 days, the spotting turned into an actual period. I am not on BC, nor have I taken any emergency contraceptives or done anything different than normal. While this may be unrelated to the vaccine,  i also have had a slight cold since about the 14th as well.

A 29 years old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: ER8729) on 09Apr2021 on left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. She took a lot of medications, antidepressants and antianxiety meds, states she told the facility where she got the vaccine about these. Until now, she said she is still experiencing dizziness, waves of nausea, tiredness, and chills. She said she feels hot and cold a lot. Last night (14Apr2021), she said she had cramps similar to that of menstrual cramps. She said she has not had cramps ever since she started being on an Intrauterine Device (IUD) and birth control. Consumer also said that she experienced Vaginal bleeding last night (14Apr2021), when she is not even scheduled to have her menstruation yet. She wants to know if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine, and if it is normal that she is still having the symptoms even after almost 7 days since receiving the vaccine. Caller states she gets dizzy a lot, waves of nausea, and felt like she had a fever, hot flashes or cold a lot. Had to call out of work on the weekend. Last night was really weird for her, was having cramps, like menstrual cramps, has an IUD and takes birth control and went to the bathroom and she was bleeding, even if she was supposed to have her period it wouldn&#39;t be the time she was supposed to be having it, called her Gynocologist to let them know. Dizziness gets worse during the day, nausea comes in waves, tries to sleep through the day, the more she sleeps the better she feels. Does not know if this is an allergic reaction. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Symptoms started 3 months after my 2nd vaccine (04/11/21). Extremely heavy irregular periods in between my normal periods. Menstrual cycle is typical 28 days. I am having very heavy periods starting 13 days into my cycle that lasts 7 days. Also having periods when I should be at the 28th day of my cycle. So essentially I&#39;m bleeding every 13-21 days. I am on Junel birth control which I started (04/24). I was on Lo Loestrin at the time of the vaccines.

I did want to report that my menstrual cycle had a ?double peak? ovulation and a resulting very late period (3 weeks late). I chart my cycle extensively and this has never  happened to me before; the only change during this cycle was the second covid shot close to my typical ovulation time. I know that stress and illness can cause a double peak (meaning ovulation is delayed), so I believe this shot may have been interpreted by my body as an illness as I was not under stress or sick at this time. I did not have an issue with my cycle during the first shot. I felt this was important to report as I had only heard of women having early or very heavy periods after the shot.

Throughout my life,  my periods are very regular and typically last 6 days. But after the vaccine, my period never stopped. I am still currently bleeding. I&#39;ve seen a doctor for it and they said its a hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst. For now the doctor isn?t too concerned,  but it?s unusual for my body to be going through this.

I also began shedding from my vagina small clumps of skin, maybe the size of a pea. I started my period about a week later and experienced much heavier flow than normal in a much shorter period of time.  My second dose was received on 01/20/21 at 10am at the same facility. The day after I began similar feelings of cramping and experienced very heavy, opaque white discharge from my vagina with a couple of pea sized clumps of what looked like my vaginal wall the day or two after, but then none at all. I continued to see this odd discharge until today (01/31/21).  Neither experience was at all painful, but it was very alarming.

                                                miscarriage; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), 2nd dose on 08Jan2021 in right arm and 1st dose on 15Dec2020 in left arm, both via intramuscular at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced allergy. Concomitant medication included prenatal vitamins. The patient experienced miscarriage on 11Jan2021 with outcome of recovered. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The mother reported she became pregnant while taking bnt162b2.  The mother was 11 weeks pregnant at the onset of the event.  The mother was due to deliver on 07Aug2021. Date of LMP was 26Oct2020. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of miscarriage included misoprostol (CYTOTEC).  Information of lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The limited information provided precludes a full clinical assessment of the case. Considering the product-event temporal relationship, a causal association between the reported &#39;miscarriage&#39; and the administration of bnt162b2 cannot be completely excluded. Case will be reassessed once with additional information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Developed fever between 100.5-101 which lasted about 18hrs which did require me to have to call into work the following day.  2/3 I developed swelling and pain in the lymph nodes under my right arm and breast.  The swelling subsided within 4days but I still have some tenderness to date.  I took tylenol and ibuprophen for the first 48 hours to help with all the symptoms.

                                                I am unsure if this is related but thought I should report it because it was highly unusual, but: My menstrual cycle began at around 12:30am on 03-19-2021. There was some bad cramping as is usual for me in the first 24 hours. I was able to function normally enough until about 9P (on 03-19-2021),  at which time I began experiencing debilitating cramps and muscle spasms that made it difficult to walk or move. I felt lightheaded and like I was going to pass out (which has never happened related to my period before). I got in bed and this persisted until moving at all brought me to tears. I have not been in this much pain from cramps and muscle spasms in over a decade.  And never this prolonged and intense. I was unable to sleep until about 4:30am, managed to sleep for a few hours, had to see, and now I&#39;m here filling this out before I attempt to go back to sleep.  My pain at the moment is high, but similar to what a normal &#34;first day of cycle and it&#39;s bad&#34; day would be for me.  Before this, though, was 8 hours straight of some of the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life.  I felt it important for me to make a formal report in the event that adverse effects surrounding menstruation were common for others and in case this does not subside. I am thinking it will like the initial muscle aches after receiving the shot.

A 30-year-old female patient (pregnant, last menstrual date 19Jan2021, Delivery date: 26Oct2021, Gestational period 4 weeks) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9269), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 19Feb2021 at 15:15 at the age of 30 years old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history included rheumatoid arthritis. There were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included prenatal vitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient received other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced early miscarriage on 01Mar2021. No treatment was received in response to the adverse event. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, patient was not tested for COVID-19. The patient was recovering from the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pending the limited information on clinical course, the company does not attribute the event early miscarriage to BNT162B2.

                                                Vaginal bleeding/irregular bleeding; bloody noses; spotting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).  This  30-years-old female patient received at hospital bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1  administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as SINGLE DOSE, and dose 2 on 07Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) administered in Arm Left  as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination 30 years. Medical history included ongoing spotting (she has had her tubes tied in the past /She continued to have spotting even after the period was over). The patient got 1st dose on 17Feb2021 and developed Vaginal bleeding, bloody noses.  She said she was having a period every 2 weeks, and &#34;spotting&#34; every other day. The she got 2nd dose on 07Mar2021, and experienced nose is bleeding and vaginal bleeding again.Then it was added she completed both; and keeps having irregular bleeding. she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination 17Feb2021 at an unknown time in the left arm. On that day she noticed irregular bleeding, spotting. Mentioned she has had her tubes tied in the past and so she called her gynecologist who made an appointment for her. Then she got her regular period two weeks later to she cancelled that appointment. She continued to have spotting even after the period was over. She mentioned this to her gynecologist twice and he said to wait and see. She received the second dose 07Mar2021 at 16:50 PM in the left arm. She noticed today on 10Mar2021 she was having vaginal bleeding and spotting with bright red blood and also a nose bleed. Mentioned she also noticed blood with sex. She was concerned and plans to contact her HCP next because her brother had osteosarcoma at 16 years old  and she has a cousin who had thrombocytopenia. Seriousness criteria provided -Other medically important conditions. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it is unlikely  that the reported &#34;vaginal bleeding, spotting with bright red blood and nose bleed&#34; were due to bnt162b2.  These are probably intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed of additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Within a few hours of vaccine administration, my menstrual cycle ceased to exist. At the time of the vaccine around noon I was on a heavy flow of day 2 on my period. I was changing tampons at my usual rate of every 4 hours. By 8pm the same day of administration, my period ceased to exist. I no longer needed to use tampons or pads at all. My menstrual cycles are consistently at LEAST 5 days long, not 2. Will follow up with my regular ob/gyn.

                                                I had my first dose of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine on the 5th of April, 2021 at 1pm. I had sore arm and was fatigued which was expected. However, the day I had my vaccine was also the day my menstrual cycle started and just to assure myself I informed the pharmacist and asked if that was okay and they said it shouldn?t be a concern.   I was doing fine until toward the end of day 3. I was expecting my period to stop as it always does on 3rd day  but I started bleeding heavier that day there after. It didn?t worry me much until I started discharging huge blood clots  as big as an apple 2 times every after 30 mins from that moment.   I rushed to the ER later that night(still bleeding heavily with blood clots every now and then) but I was not admitted since my vitals and the blood counts were normal at that moment.   I went back home  and hoped the bleeding would stop but again with on pain or fever what so ever I kept bleeding all day. This is my 5th day of bleeding. Then on Sunday morning, I still kept bleeding heavy and I was too weak that I went back to the ER again.   This time , (day 6) I got admitted because I have had lost a lot of blood and I needed blood transfusion. My HB dropped from 11.3 to 6.7 and it went further down to 5 something. I got 3 units of blood transfusion in the ER. They did ultrasound, CT scans(with and without contrast) and still couldn?t figure out the cause of the bleeding. My uterus showed no problems but my body was not even responding to Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. So the doctor proceeded with an angiogram and did an emergency uterine artery Embolization to stop the blood supply to the uterus. The bleeding stopped there after and I started regaining my vitals.  However, the cause of the bleeding still remains unknown.

                                                My period is 6 days late. This is not normal for me and nothing else has changed in my life since my last menstrual cycle. My period is incredibly predictable and it is physically impossible that I am pregnant. I took a pregnancy test just as an extra precaution and it was negative. I have been seeing news reports of women indicating that their cycle was disturbed by the vaccine and until it happened to me, I questioned the veracity of these claims. However it has now affected me and I believe that the vaccine is the cause. I do not know if this constitutes an adverse event but since it is a side effect that is not listed on the CDC website, and since it is affecting my physiology, I believe that it should be considered seriously.

                                                Miscarriage.  I was 5 weeks pregnant at the time of the 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on 4/23/21.    On 4/22/21, the pregnancy was confirmed by Ob/Gyn through a blood test, urine sample, and ultrasound.  I was at the time and am a healthy 30 year old woman without pre-existing medical conditions or any conditions that would put me into a high-risk pregnancy category.  The estimated due date was 12/20/21.   Received 2nd COVID on 4/23/21.    At 3:30pm on 4/28/21, I began miscarrying the pregnancy.  On the same day at 4pm, I was at Ob/Gyn and they confirmed that the pregnancy was likely miscarrying through an ultrasound and blood tests.    IMPORTANT: On 4/28/21, the pregnancy measured exactly the same in size as it did on 4/22/21.  In other words, the pregnancy either STOPPED growing the SAME DAY it was confirmed or the EXTACT NEXT DAY, which was the day I received the 2ND COVID VACCINE.   I discussed with my Doctor wither to proceed with the 2nd Covid vaccine and it was suggested that while it hasn?t been tested extensively in pregnancy, it was thought to be safe.

It started out as spotting, then became heavier. It has since become lighter in flow but I am still bleeding as of 03May2021. Color is inconsistent compared to other cycles. It ranges from bright red to rust color red.

The next week, 04/20/2021 I began to have abdominal pain and blood in my urine. I went to the doctor. The diagnosis was that I was having a miscarriage. I was supposed to have 7 weeks of pregnancy. The embryo appeared to have about 5 weeks. It appears that after the vaccine the embryo stop developing. On 04/21/2021 the miscarriage took place without any medication taken to accelerate the process.  Before my schedule second dose for the vaccine, I called the clinic and asked for a doctor appt. I wanted to talk to a doctor regarding my early pregnancy stage and the upcoming vaccine. At first I was denied. Then after a struggle I was provided with a lab test to confirm my pregnancy. On 04/12/2021 in the morning, I called the clinic to speak with a doctor and ask his/her opinion about the vaccine and my early pregnancy. After an struggle, the receptionist told me that the nurse who had the results of my pregnancy was busy. She would call me later on the date. That been pregnant or not, the vaccine was secure. I asked that I wanted to have a talk so I can make my decision. But the receptionist repeated the same. And after I said thank you but the phone was cut. That is when I decided not to miss my vaccine appt.

                                                So my PMDD came back with a vengeance after the second dose of the vaccine. After the first dose, I had the most painful period t the most painful 12 hours of my entire life, so I was worried about THAT. Turns out I was physically fine, but mentally very unwell. It felt different/ similar to when I was 19 and tried an antidepressant that made me feel actively suicidal, so. I don&#39;t know how to describe the difference in feeling, but it came out of nowhere, was very strong, I wanted to kill myself for half of April, and it wasn&#39;t for any *reason* whatsoever, it was just hormonal. So my best guess is that the second dose interfered with the balance my birth control gives me now, and the shock to my system made it even worse than it had been in the past.  This lasted from the 4th, through my period, and after, until the 19th.  I was barely able to take care of myself at all during this time, and it was very difficult/ debilitating. Also scary!

I experienced shortness of breath for about 3 days while walking normally and going up and down stairs. Pain dissipated by the end of day 10. During these 10 days, pain radiated up my neck and at one point the right side of my cheek and upper lip went numb for about 2 minutes. Then starting on around June 6th, pain in abdomen started. Symptoms of current experience includes: nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain in lower right, upper left, and back on left side. Pain is mild to moderate, comes and goes. Feeling of fullness and pressure in abdomen constantly, even before eating for the first time of the day. Very fatigued. Menstrual cycle is late. Pregnancy test is negative. Dr. performed a battery of tests - urinalysis, blood, and COVID-19 nasal swab. CT scan of abdomen scheduled for Monday June 14 with Oral Contrast. IV Contrast allergy.

My period was 25 days late and was clotty.  The dizziness continues to persist although I have figured out that certain things trigger it to be worse (alcohol, flourescent lights). I am currently 8 days late for my period.  Had blood work done and confirmed that I&#39;m not pregnant. All other things on blood work came back normal.

My period was due June 7th and my second vaccine shot was May 25th. I am now almost two weeks late and not pregnant. I&#39;ve been having premenstrual symptoms now for the entire two weeks including sore, swollen breasts, cramping, and bloating. It&#39;s like my body is expecting my period to start any day now but it&#39;s not. Two days ago while I was brushing my teeth and getting ready for work, I suddenly got the worst sharp pains in my pelvic region and rectum to the point that I couldn&#39;t stand. I had to lay down for an hour. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that before. I&#39;m a very healthy &amp; stress free individual that does not take any medication (birth control, over the counter meds, etc.) The Pfizer vaccine is the only &#34;new&#34; thing to come into my body.

                                                My Pfizer shots were delivered on Feb 18 and March 12, 2021. I experienced irregular menstrual symptoms from March 1-March 13 of 2021. My typical menstrual cycle is 26-28 days, with 3-4 days of concentrated bleeding. My previous 3 periods were Dec 18-22. Jan 17-20, and Feb 12-16. On March 1 almost 2 weeks before my expected period, I started spotting and cramping. The light bleeding continued for 2 weeks, at which time it transitioned into my typical period with regular cramps and bleeding, in line with my usual experience. My GYN did not know what could be causing this (I later found out there have been many irregular menstrual symptoms associated with Covid-19 vaccines. I don&#39;t regret getting it, this was fairly mild, but if there is a causitive link between the vaccines and mesntrual side effects, women NEED to know this. Menstrual and female reproductive health side effects need to be observed and measured in clinical trials, and female patients need to be advised what to expect.

A 31-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot/batch number not reported, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 08:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization. Patient was pregnant. Patient has no other vaccines in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. Patient has no COVID prior vaccination and no known allergies. On 05Feb2021 at 06:00 PM, patient experienced miscarriage 8 days after receiving 2nd vaccine at 6 weeks pregnant. No treatment received for the event miscarriage. The event resulted in doctor&#39;s office/clinic visit. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the event miscarriage was recovering.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, a possible contributory role of the vaccination with BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of miscarriage in this patient at 6 weeks pregnant cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

I had a slight period the day after (03/05/21) which lasted about 3 days.  I thought it was just a coincidence and didn&#39;t think much of it.  The same issue happened after I got the second dose on 03/26/21; I got my period again.  My period is usually normal (every 27-31 days), so it was definitely strange to me that my period came so soon and both times were immediately the day after the shot.  It was just a normal period with no blood clots or anything abnormal, but I do feel like it&#39;s an adverse reaction of my body to the vaccine.

                                                About one week after getting the Covid vaccine I started to experience menstrual spotting. I have never experienced spotting in my life prior to getting the vaccine. I track my cycle on an app and this spotting occurred 2-3 week before I am expected to get my period. This was a very noticeable side effect and something I?ve never experienced outside of getting the vaccine.

I have broken out all over my face due to the hormone changes. This is something that never happens. I did have a headache and extreme fatigue as well, but the intense hormones and constant heavy bleeding are the worst.

                                                I started with chills/fever the night of my 2nd shot. All night, I had body aches, joint pain, migraine, unable to sleep and SEVERE stiff neck pain. The most concerning side affect for me was I felt as though my central nervous system was affected. I had difficulty speaking, formulating sentences and experienced general confusion. I couldn&#39;t communicate with my husband to tell him how sick I felt or what I even needed.  The fever went away after 24 hours, the joint pain stuck around for 3-4 days, as did the migraine and exhaustion.  My menstrua cycle has also been affected. It&#39;s heavier, lasting longer and affected my usual cycle time.

                                                At the exact moment of injection , complete arm tense. After standing immediately on 1st injection I experienced dizziness. During my ?observation? 15 minutes I was walking around the store with blurry and spotty vision. I almost felt like I was going to fall over, and had the feeling immediately that I needed to go to sleep. After eating ( this was at 9 in the morning after a full night of good sleep) I felt as if I needed to go to sleep immediately. I continued to sleep for two hours after the first dose. My menstrual cycle was delayed this month as well by 7 days and very heavy. The second dose was very similar. I have to say the pharmacy was excellent as I told them my experience with the first dose. I sat for 15 mins to make sure I wasn?t going to fall. I sat but still felt dizzy and saw spots with blurry vision. Same reaction. I went to sleep without hesitation like there was not a force in the world  that could stop me. I have continued on both occasions to feel the effects around 24-48 hours after.

Additionally, my breasts have been swollen, tender, and painful on and off since I got my first dose. Some nausea intermittently throughout the last 3 weeks. I have been spotting the last few days and it&#39;s about 8 days before I should be starting my period and my breasts are swollen, tender, and painful again.

About 2 weeks post first Covid Pfizer vaccination April 22nd, 2021: -I experienced a terrible headache and stomach pain like none I had ever had before 10/10 pain scale. -I took 2 tablets of 500 mg of acetaminophen to treat the pain but it had no effect. After 8 hours past I then took 3 tablets of 200 mg ibuprofen which still had no response to pain.  -The following day my sense of smell was off and still is. It&#39;s like a rancid smell? I gave it some time to see if it would go away but it is still present. -I am also experiencing irregularities in my menstrual cycle such as heavy bleeding and very large clots (2-3 in in size). It has made me unable to go about my daily activities and I&#39;ve been extremely fatigued. I&#39;ve never had this issue previously and am not on any kind of medications or birth control.

Typically my menstruation will last approximately 3-4 days. After last vaccine my period has returned on schedule but unusually heavy and lasting two days, the days following I am experiencing spotting which is unusual for me. I spoke to my gynecologist about it and he said this has been reported as a symptom of the vaccine. He asked me to return to his office if my periods are not back to normal within 3-6 months.

                                                I was 22 weeks pregnant when I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Then, 2 weeks later when I was 24 weeks pregnant, I started having vaginal bleeding. I was in the hospital for 3 days as the doctors believed I may be going into very early labor.  They suspect a partial placenta abruption. As a result, my cervix was found to be short, also indicating potential early labor coming. I was put on bed rest. Two weeks after the bleeding started, I lost much of my mucus plug (at 26 weeks). When at hospital at 24 weeks, I was given  steroids to make my baby?s lungs develop faster just in case he?s born soon. I was also prescribed progesterone which I?ve been taking nightly. I?m now also taking magnesium supplements and drinking chamomile tea.  This may be unrelated, but I have also been found to be low in iron so now I?m taking iron supplements too.   Due date is Aug 2, 2021; I?m 31 years old; I am currently 29 weeks pregnant and still have not gone into labor; This is my second pregnancy, my first pregnancy was two years prior, and it was 100% healthy.

                                                Went in for my depo shot the first week of March and I had my first covid shot March 26th 2021, the second shot on April 16th 2021. About two days later I started to bleed, which is normal with the depo shot, but after the usual amount of bleeding time I thought this isn&#39;t right (usually a week). I bled for over a month (6 to 7 weeks)  and firmly believe it is due to the covid vaccine.

                                                Did not know we were pregnant, received vaccine. Got positive pregnancy test a few days later and miscarried the next month at 8 weeks with baby measuring 6 weeks. Have no history of miscarriage and two full term healthy babies prior to this. Unknown if related for sure, but this is the only change and timing seems important to report as possibly correlated.

However, the blood was VERY dark, like maroon in color. The bleeding continued until May 24th. My previous period in April was a regular period that had begun on April 23rd and lasted for 6 days. My irregular bleeding during the entire month of May was accompanied by infrequent cramping and breast tenderness.

This is unusual for me.  That breast is ever so slightly naturally bigger than my right, but they always are affected equally/in tandem in regards to my cycle.

                                                At the  beginning of January, my husband and I had already been trying to conceive. I received my second dose vaccine on 01-07-2021. In the first week of February I found out I was pregnant. By the end of February I had a miscarriage. I had the miscarriage on 02-24-2021. The day I miscarried I was going to have my first gynecological appointment to check my baby.  I do not know if the vaccine had anything to do with my miscarriage. I was hesitant to getting my second dose but I still went through with it. I just think it is important for mothers who are expecting to wait at least till their second trimester to receive the Covid 19 vaccine, my opinion.

I experienced my second period since my first vaccine 28 days after my last period. I did not have the cramping like the previous cycle,  but i  still experienced  heavier than normal period.  Separately, my memory recall seems to be worse post-vaccine.

I have never experienced this in 20 years of having a period. My cycle went from 4 days to 7, and I have to wear an adult diaper during these days now. I have had bloodwork and an ultrasound, which showed increased thickness in uterine lining. Now having to have a biopsy done. This has continued with every cycle following my first injection.

I received my first dose of the covid vaccine on March 8th, 2021. I noticed some light spotting afterwards.  The heartbeat was confirmed on March 22nd and I was told I was six weeks along. I received my second dose on March 29th.  The heartbeat was confirmed again during another ultrasound on April 20th, 2021. During an ultrasound on May 4th, 2021 I was told that there was no longer a heartbeat and the baby had stopped developing a week prior.  This missed miscarriage resulted in an D&amp;C on May 11th, 2021.

Around 5:30am I took two extra strength Tylenol to no avail. I proceeded with chills, shakes, fever, cold hands and feet, sweating, exhaustion, and loss of appetite. These expected symptoms subsided/ were manageable at approximately 5:30 pm.   At 7pm, I began having trouble climbing the stairs and had intense pain in the center of my chest. I could breath alright (I was NOT light headed), but couldn&#39;t alleviate the chest pain. I went to sleep at 8:30pm in hopes that it would dissipate.  **(Did not go to hospital because we are military, my husband is TDY and I had no one to watch our children. This is not to downgrade the fear or intensity of the pain. I have a very high pain threshold- this was awful.)**  Saturday (Day 3 after vaccine) no chest pain, but began spotting (my period is very regular and tracked diligently-I&#39;m not meant to start for another 8 days),  still had a very sore neck/ migraine, and swollen/painful lymph nodes in my armpit ( on the vaccine side). Sunday (day 3 after vaccine) still spotting heavily, painful lymph nodes, and migraine.

                                                Got menstrual cycle like almost two and a half weeks early; Abdominal pain radiating to upper and middle back; Abdominal pain radiating to upper and middle back; Stomach cramps; Nausea; Fatigue; Headache; Sinus infection; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: Unspecified AE. Upon receipt of follow-up information on (04Jan2021), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital.  Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome.  Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), famotidine (PEPCID), ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (CILIQUE) for birth control and multivitamin. It was stated that the patient got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. On 17Dec2020, she developed severe abdominal pain radiating to her upper and her middle back with pretty bad nausea, fatigue and headache. It was also mentioned that the patient had stomach cramps. These continued all the way until like Christmas. And then on the 19Dec2020, she actually got her menstrual cycle though she was not due to start that till that week. So, it came like almost two and a half weeks early (which was super weird as for her). The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX); famotidine and hyoscyamine for like stomach cramping. She also took that as well, acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). It was mentioned that the symptoms stopped on 26Dec2020 then she sinus infection right after in Dec 2020. Outcome of the event of sinus infection was unknown while the remaining events recovered on 26Dec2020. The patient stated that the she don&#39;t think that sinus infection was correlated at all but all other symptoms were happening right after the vaccine (reported as related).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event sinus infection is likely intercurrent and is unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2.

A 32-year-old female patient (3 weeks pregnant at time of vaccination) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included iron and minerals nos, vitamins nos (PRENATAL VITAMINS). The patient had a negative pregnancy test in 2020 before getting the first vaccine dose, but then had a positive pregnancy test in Jan2021 a few days after the first dose, but unfortunately she had a miscarriage in Jan2021, about 5-6 days before her second dose. She has an appointment scheduled with OBGYN for the miscarriage. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the miscarriage was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event miscarriage with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

                                                On the evening (8:00 pm) of my second COVID vaccination, I experienced severe ovulation pain. It was comparable to having a 15-20 minute contraction during unmedicated childbirth. It impaired my ability to function. I was bent over in pain and took a hot bath and two ibuprofen.  It subsided in about 30 minutes, but I continued to feel weak afterwards.   I was on cycle day 17 and my average cycle length is 28 days. I have a Paraguard IUD and do not take hormonal birth control.  I do experience mid cycle pain with some regularity, but this was by far my most severe experience.

My periods are regular (between 27-29 days) so this is very irregular and concerning. No other changes has occurred in my life to cause such a drastic cycle change. I am only on day 2 of my period but so far it looks like any other day two so I&#39;m assuming it will run the full 5 day course.

The evening after my second dose I got my period, I was not due to have my period for another two weeks. My period was very heavy flow, extremely painful cramps. Four days after my period started I experienced heavy and severe nose bleeds. The nose bleeds felt concerning - they would start randomly and flow heavy, taking 5min to stop. I felt very fatigued.

Almost like my uterus felt a dull very very mild pressure. Day 2 after receiving my shot, I started to bleed. I am exclusively breastfeeding and I have never had a period start this early with all of my other children. Normal is 7 plus months for me. This period was also not a normal period. I had zero cramps. I felt nothing. I never have had a period with zero cramps. Lasted for 7 days.

Then the next period I had was incredibly heavy with lots of clots and very painful for about 4 days. I?ve never experienced that.

                                                My menstrual cycle started a day before my shot was administered. I track my cycle with an app, and it usually lasts 3-4 days for the past couple years, at least. It?s also quite regular. The cycle I started the day before I got my shot lasted an extra three days at least, and was slightly heavier flow for longer than usual.  I count that as my first effect that was not a ?normal? symptom.   Yesterday, 5/11/21, I started ?spotting? again, or having trace amounts of blood when I urinated. I?ve felt bloated as well the last couple days, as I do when I?m starting my cycle. Today my cycle has gone from ?spotting? to ?light? flow, with more noticeable cramps; in other words my cycle seems to be starting again, two weeks ahead of schedule. My next shot is scheduled for this upcoming Monday, 5/17/21.   My next menstrual cycle was supposed to start around 5/25/21.  My cycle is usually consistent within a day or two of its estimated schedule.

                                                My period was extremely heavy for a few hours on day two of my cycle. I couldn?t leave the bathroom, the blood was very thin and had lots of clots. It was just evacuating my body so quickly. Normally, my period is very consistently light. This has never happened to me in my entire 20 years of menstruating. It was painless, no cramps, just very heavy and then after a few hours of nonstop bleeding, it went back to normal. It?s almost like the entire living decided to shed in a few hours rather than the extended few days that it normally happens in. The whole cycle still only lasted a few days like normal, just those few hours were noticeably abnormally heavy.

                                                The day following my vaccination (4/24/21) I awoke feeling completely nauseous and dizzy. Upon getting out of bed I immediately sat on the floor due to the extreme dizziness and fear of passing out I felt. After a few minutes in this state I vomited. I had a fever which I managed with Tylenol. I felt fatigued and weak the entire day. I ran a fever the entire day, again managing it with Tylenol.  The following day (4/25/2021) my fever was gone and I felt better, however about midday I began experiencing cramps and vaginal bleeding. I was 5.5weeks pregnant with an estimated due date of 12/24/2021. I went to the ER with concerns of a miscarriage. Based on abdominal ultrasound and subsequent HCGquant testing over the next week it was determined I had encountered a miscarriage and lost the baby.

A 32-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Jan2021 16:00 (lot number: EL3247) at the age of 32 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from 3 years, allergies (all her life), Chiari malformation from 10 years, vocal cord dysfunction from 3 years, Vitamin D low, constipation and Ferritin low. Concomitant medications included albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL) taken for asthma; clarithromycin (CLARITIN) taken for allergies; iron taken for ferritin low; magnesium taken for constipation; and vitamin d [vitamin d nos] (VITAMIN D) taken for Vitamin D low; all taken from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported she had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 16:00PM in the left arm. About 10 minutes into her wait period (28Jan2021), her heart started to pound; her lips numb and face went numb and warm; she had metallic taste in her mouth; and her mouth/tongue and throat felt itchy. She went up to the nurse to tell her about her symptoms and they hooked her up to an O2 monitor that showed her heart rate at 160 beats per minute but her 02 was okay, it was not under 97%. She was given a generic form of Zyrtec. They monitored her for an hour and her heart pounding stopped. The metallic taste was very brief, and lips and face numbness, and mouth and throat felt itchy all resolved that same day. The next day (29Jan2021), she was tired. Then about 50 hours after the shot, in the night on the 29Jan2021 to 30Jan2021 she started getting weird stabbing shocks in her chest (chest pain) that lasted 3 hours. She would wake up with the pain and then fall back to sleep. It happened several times for a few hours then went away. Lastly, she added that she never ever misses her period but now she is two weeks late (also reported as 11 days late) and she is not pregnant. She expected her period to start on 02Feb2021. She did visit her allergist before getting the vaccine and he said none of her allergies were related to any of the ingredients in the shot. Then she saw the allergist again after the shot and the allergist didn&#39;t think she needed to be concerned as the allergist said her symptoms are not in line with an anaphylactic reaction. She is planning to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 18Feb2021. Outcome of the event &#39;stabbing shocks in her chest (chest pain)&#39; was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of &#39;her period is now 11 days late&#39; was recovered on unspecified date. Outcome of tired was recovered on 29Jan2021, while outcome of the remaining events was recovered on 28Jan2021.

My period after my first shot started on April 21st as anticipated (I am very regular with light periods). This period was unusual - on the second day I experienced the worst cramps I have experienced since labor, I had to pull over my car on my way to work while I experienced close 8 back to back severe cramps in 5 minute period. It was like labor. Also had clots the size of quarters which I have never seen before .  The second and third day was extremely heavy and then the bleeding stopped. I am now on my first period after the second vaccine and I am once again experiencing heavier than usual bleeding on the second day with massive clots.

                                                2 days after the first vaccination I had pain while urinating, lower back pain on the right side pain just below the ribs and the kidney area on the right side and right side pelvic pain, lower abdomin pain around bladder area. Doctor thought it could be a UTI so I was prescribed antibiotics I&#39;ve never had a UTI. After finishing the antibiotics there is no relief pain was worse. I received the second vaccination on 4/28. After receiving that vaccination my left side started hurting and the right side pain continued. After much testing with no results that came up with any issues I was sent to see a urologist. Who after hearing my symptoms and the timing of them believed that it was an adverse effect to receiving the covid vaccination. He put me on some pain medication to help me sleep as I had not slept in a month and now I am feeling much better. Symptoms started on 4/9 and it is now 5/27 and I am starting to feel normal again.

A 32-year-old pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer), dose 1 on 17Mar2021 13:30 and dose 2 on 07Apr2021 13:30, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at a workplace clinic. Medical history was not reported. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included unspecified prenatal vitamin, iron supplement, and sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT). No other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The fetus she was pregnant with stopped growing at 5.5 weeks which happened to be the same time she had the vaccine. She ended up with a miscarriage. The adverse events resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received: took medicine to complete the miscarriage process. Since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I was supposed to be due December 31st, 2021.   On my 8 week appointment check up; the OB discovered there was no longer a heartbeat they could find for baby. I subsequently went in for a recheck 1 week later ( today) to discover there was still no heartbeat for baby. I was diagnosed as having a misses miscarriage. I was given the same medication that patients receive when they want to have a medical abortion by choice. I will go back to the OB in 10 days to make sure that all of the pregnancy has vacated and the uterus is clear for a new pregnancy.

This lasted approximately 5-6 hours, then started again the following day and lasted overnight, for approximately 12 hours.  I was pregnant at the time of the vaccine being administered, just over 14 weeks.  The day the bleeding stopped (day 3) was the first day of week 15.  I contacted the on call OB who suggested I follow-up with my regular OB on Monday, or to go to the ER if it got worse. During the exam on 5/24/2021 the OB was unable to determine anything wrong with the placenta, baby or my heath and was unable to explain the bleeding other than a potential side effect of the vaccine.

As the days continued I began to develop more bumps on Left heel that traveled to my right foot. In total I have 10 plantar warts that developed which has caused my to be temporarily disabled from work.  Shortly after when I recieved my menstraul cycle, it was extremely heavy and full of large blood clots. This was not my baseline. we are in the month of June and I have had irregular periods ever since vaccine. In March 2020 I had a cardiovascular incident that resulted in a RIGHT BUNLE BRANCH BLOCK. I&#39;m following a cardiologist. I have had multiple issues with my body ever since I received this vaccine and urge the public to please read and educate yourself before you get it. Im just now starting to experience tingling in my arms and legs. All of the issues Ive list are all AUTOIMMUNE ISSUES. This vaccine has destroyed my health and hijacked my immune system.

The bleeding was comparable to the amount typically experienced a few days after giving birth. It lasted for about a day and a half. A week later, a small amount of bleeding occurred but only lasted for about six hours.

At 6 wk 5 days, growth of growth of fetus stopped, as determined by ultrasound at what should have been 9 weeks (6/3). No heartbeat was ever detected. Yolk sac was determined to be enlarged and thin-walled, and blood tests showed a low progesterone level. Started daily Rx progesterone but on 6/5, spotting occurred and RX was discontinued. Spotting continued for one week on and off, with no heavier bleeding. Second ultrasound on 6/10 showed no change. On 6/13, miscarriage of gestational sac and fetal tissue occurred. Bleeding continued for about one week.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

Very abnormal because I have the Nexplanon implanted in my arm and may have 2-3 periods per year. Normally the periods I do have are heavier and last 3-5days.

No ovarian pain yet.

I went to urgent care and was prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding to no avail. I then proceeded to go to urgent care again because the bleeding had not stopped. At my second Doctors visit, I had an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound done, and both of them came back completely normal. I have now scheduled an upcoming obgyn appointment, but cannot be seen until 03/09/2021.

                                                Beginning the day after my shot, I experienced engorging in my left breast. My breast was swollen, hard, and painful to touch. I?m currently breastfeeding my 7 month old, and I wasn?t able to get much milk out. I haven?t had an issue with engorgement since my baby was first born and my milk came in. Since this was unusual, I think it?s related to the vaccine. The engorging only lasted the day after my shot, and it went away that evening (lasted about 12 hours).

                                                I got the usual arm pain at injection site the night after getting the vaccine. 24 hours later, I had really bad diarrhea (possibly connected) but nothing else yet. 2 days after, i woke up with the normal fatigue, slight headache, and nausea from upset stomach. But what I did not expect was that 2nd night I got my period a week early and super heavy (I&#39;m on birth control and haven&#39;t had my period, except for some spotting, in years). I spoke to some friends and a few of them suprisingly also reported extra heavy menstrual cycles or feeling like they were PMSing around 48 hours after. I couldn&#39;t find much online except for a bunch of random people complaining about the same thing, and no study or source of significance to back it. I&#39;m wondering if this something they even looked out for? There seems to be a pretty strong correlation with certain people around my age just from asking around. And I don&#39;t think anyone who I spoke to even realized it could be connected until I mentioned it. It was just shocking and significant to me because I&#39;m on set pills that I didn&#39;t miss, with no menstrual cycle issues, and I haven&#39;t bled more than spotting in years until this. It lessened the next day, and lessened again today since that symptom started.

                                                I experienced a miscarriage that started with bleeding on 3/13 and was confirmed by ongoing hcg level tests starting on 3/17. I passed a lot of blood and blood tissue in an intense event on 3/16. I did not know I was pregnant at the time and was estimated to be around 9-10 weeks (due date around October 2021) based on hcg levels. I was also breastfeeding at the time of my vaccine. I was advised to go to the emergency room if certain conditions occurred including extreme pain -- I opted to go to Urgent Care that evening to get checked out and to get a blood hcg test. Urgent care was unable to do the blood test and they recommended I call my provider the next day or go to the Emergency Department if certain symptoms occurred.

Some looked like large blood clots, while others looks like they might contain tissue almost like what you would expect in the event of a miscarriage.

Symptoms the second time were not as prevalent as the first time but still noticeable.

The next day I had extreme cramping that lasted longer than usual. My periods are consistent with pain &#43; the general time frame for cramps is usually a few hours on the first day of bleeding. However, I experienced intense cramping and pain in my ovaries, and lower back for three full days. While there was not heavier bleeding, there was more pain in the ovaries and uterus.

I usually bleed very lightly, and I have consistently since having the Mirena IUD inserted 3 years ago.  This past period (began 4/21 and still bleeding) started last Wednesday and was very heavy from the start. I bled through 3 normal tampons in the span of an hour; I even bled through onto my clothes.  This never happens for me. I was also passing large clots, some of them were around the diameter of a golf ball.  I also had stronger cramps than normal, and when I would cramp I would feel nauseous, which is also different.

Right and left armpits had multiple (6&#43; each side) protruding lymph nodes, one node on the right side was very large. Lymph nodes in chest, jaw and groin were also swollen.  The lymph node swelling lasted the entire menstrual cycle (about 6 days) and then went back to normal. I drank 100 oz of water on day the node swelling reduced which I account for the reduced swelling but note it also recovered at the end of menstrual cycle.

I ended up going to urgent care after, as I immediately developed: a sudden cold rush sensation in my chest, a spinning room, a puffy/ numb face and a slowing of speech and confusion/ forgetfulness of basic facts (my address etc). The doctor said that my vitals were fine (no anaphylactic shock) . One day later, my face muscles are feeling a bit sluggish (moreso on my left side) along with what felt puffy in my face from my cheeks to my chin (although didn?t look puffy). 3 days after the vaccine I called 911, Because I was getting numbness and heaviness on the left side of my face as well as in my left arm. Alongside this sensation, I started to feel what seemed to be me period cramps, even though I just finished my period. Paramedics came and checked my vitals, which were fine. 4 days after the shot I was getting heavy gobs of vaginal pale yellow discharge.

                                                The next day after I received the Pfizer vaccine I started feeling sick and lightheaded it had a headache. I think nothing of it and then my menstrual cycle started early and it started off being heavier than usual. Then I notice when I went to wipe myself or use the bathroom blood clots was falling out. Being that I work in the medical field I know like if is not bigger than 1/4 there&#39;s nothing to really worry about. So as the day went on and the following days I noticed that the blood clots kept on getting bigger and bigger and coming faster and faster. At this point I started getting concerned, that&#39;s when I decided to go to the hospital. At the emergency room at Hospital  they really didn&#39;t do nothing for me but gave me an ultrasound and gave me some birth control told me to follow up with my OBGYN. But I already made an appointment with OBGYN cuz I just feel like if something was going on and I can&#39;t get in to see them till June 30th. They did give me some birth control and tell me your help with the bleeding and for me to take some ferrous sulfate. They said they&#39;d never heard of this reaction before. So I went on May 1st to get my second vaccine. Before I received it, I talked to doctor there and they told me it would be fine for me to get it. Now my symptoms and reactions are starting all over. I&#39;m so concerned about what&#39;s going on with my body. I just need somebody to explain to me what&#39;s going on. I cannot afford another hospital ER bill again.

                                                I am on hormonal birth control and I always start my period 3 days into the placebo pills. This month (2 weeks after the second dose) my period started before I finished the hormones. About 3 days before they were done. I also had noticibly more cramping and the bleeding was light but a very dark brown. I haven&#39;t done anything for it yet. I am monitoring it to see if it gets better or worse. I believe that maybe the vaccine did something to my hormones because the morning after Vax #2 my breasts and nipples were sore.

                                                Started bleeding profusely as if having period but an extreme version. It was 2 weeks prior to my scheduled period and my period is very regular and always arrives on time. Bleeding lasted for several days. I don&#39;t know if this will have lasting effects on my cycle or fertility going forward.

I am very consistent in my cycle and receive my period every 28 days. I am now on day 30 and still have not received it. Irregular menstrual cycles should be reported as a possible side effect.

                                                I immediately started menstruation 5 days earlier than expected less than 1 hour after receiving the 2nd dose of this vaccine. Next I noticed my vision was slightly blurry and I was becoming lethargic. Within 12 hours I had a low grade fever, heart palpitations, and severe night sweats. By 24 hours I felt out of breath if I walked more than 10 feet away and I got extremely dizzy and felt faint if I walked too far. My period lasted 2 days longer than it should have and was heavier than normal. It is now 12 days later and I still feel fatigued, anxious, dizzy, and my hormones feel off. I definitely do not feel right. I get nauseous from the dizziness even though I have been drinking a gallon of water a day and not exercising. I am a very active person and I have been forced to be extremely inactive to keep all of these symptoms at bay.

                                                I am 33 and trying to conceive, and I religiously track my menstrual cycle (periods, ovulation, tested hormone levels, and symptoms leading up to and following both).  I have a 28-29 day cycle and it is as regular and consistent as the sun rising every day.  In the days leading up to my period, I always experience tell-tale signs that my period is coming (specifically, back &amp; leg cramping, breast pain &amp; tenderness, and increased emotionalism/weepiness).  I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 3/30/21.  My period started on 4/16/21 following a normal/standard 28-day cycle. It was lighter and shorter than normal, but I ovulated at the expected time following that period, and it did not seem particularly unusual in any way. I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/22/21. Since that time, I have not gotten a period, nor have I experienced ANY of the premenstrual symptoms that I have experienced before every single period in the last 20&#43; years. I?m now on day 34 of my cycle, I have not had a period, and I am not pregnant.  As I desperately search for answers on the internet, the CDC and other health authorities consistently say there is ?no evidence? that covid vaccines have any impact on menstrual cycles, despite tens of thousands of women with anecdotal evidence. This is infuriating and completely unacceptable. I NEVER would have been vaccinated had I known it would affect my cycles. It may be temporary, it may not affect fertility directly, but i have zero chance of conceiving this month, because there is no way to track and time my cycle. I am 33, desperately trying to conceive, and not getting any younger.  To not tell women this prior to getting the vaccine, and to ignore it and deny it is even a problem, is absolutely criminal.

                                                I was not pregnant at the time of my first vaccine- I first tested positive on April 24, about 2.5 weeks after my first vaccine. This is my first pregnancy. Estimated date of delivery is December 31, 2021.   On May 3, I began spotting. I had an ultrasound where pregnancy was confirmed. On May 6 I began bleeding- I had another ultrasound that confirmed a subchorionic hematoma (SCH). Due to the level of bleeding and size of the SCH, as well as low progesterone and somewhat slow rising HCG levels (though not dangerously low), I was told to prepare for miscarriage. At a follow up appointment on May 13, one day after my second Pfizer vaccine, the ultrasound showed normal embryonic development and a heartbeat! Follow up appointment on May 20 showed continued normal development, as well as a collapsed and smaller SCH. I continue to have some light cramping and spotting.  I do not have any reason to suspect that this even was a result of the vaccine- but as it (and my positive pregnancy test) took place during the vaccination process, I wanted to report.

My menstrual cycle started a few days early (which isn&#39;t necessarily unusual) but the bleeding was so heavy.  I had a myomectomy 2 years ago and prior to that surgery, I had extremely heavy and painful menses.  I experienced very similar symptoms after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  I can only attribute this to the vaccine because I have not had those symptoms since then.

                                                Just over 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine, I experienced an irregular menstrual cycle, characterized as shortened 19 day cycle, arriving 1 week earlier than anticipated. For the past 3 years, all cycles have been 25-27 days without any irregularity. Period characterized by heavy bleeding, which has continued as bright red bleeding several days beyond typical length of period.  Consulted with Fertility specialist and Fertility RN via telehealth platforms. Immediately following the vaccine on May 17, I did experience potentially abnormal symptoms (minor bleeding) at the end of my cycle. While trying to conceive, abnormal menstrual cycles and anovulation represent a significant lost opportunity to conceive.

                                                Strong irregular menstrual period bleeding, severe abdominal cramping, severe bloating. I treated it as though it was my typical menstrual cycle, taking ibuprofen 800 mg every 6 hours. My cycles are usually mild and regular, every 28 days. It had been less than 2 weeks since my last one. I did some research and found a bunch of other women who experienced the same thing. Still going through it currently, in quite a bit of pain.

I began spotting blood on 3/7/2021 and miscarried an approximately 7 week old embryo. I had a D &amp; C procedure to remove the baby that stopped growing weeks before ( I was 14 weeks and 1 day into my pregnancy before the miscarriage).Due date was sept 4th 2021.

VERY SEVERE mental health issues, sadness, hopelessness, irritibility that I do not normally experience with PMS normally. I also am extremely regular with my menstruation and have tracked my period for years, and it is always consistent. as of 4/5 still having very heavy bleeding and clotting, some cramping. bleeding is showing no signs of letting up and my period expected start date is around 4/13. I almost didn&#39;t want to say anything because it could be chalked up to hormones or stress but this has not happened to me before, and the emotional state I was in was very bad, not even taking into account the bleeding. I am a very pro science and pro data person so I was hesitant to mention anything at all, but feel like IF this is related this could be a huge risk for folks who have a history of depression and anxiety or post partum conditions. The best way I can describe it was deep hopelessness, something I had not felt since having post partum depression when my daughter was born, 7 years ago.

                                                Started bleeding from what I assume is an early period?2 weeks early?within just hours after the vaccine. The blood is heavier than usual. I haven?t had an early period in over 5 years, since giving birth to my son. The blood is brighter and different from my typical period blood.  Concerned about what this means for my reproductive health. If worsens, will be calling my gynecologist.

Miscarriage occurred in the week following the second vaccine. Exact date that the heartbeat stopped is not able to be determined but there was a heartbeat 3/3. I got the vaccine 3/4.

I also had sharp pains in the side of my breast on the same side that I received the vaccine on.

After my second shot about a week and a half later I started to have a period again, which my other one had just ended a week prior.

                                                It started with a very painful headache about 8 hours in. Then chills.   Overnight, I experienced the worst period cramps of my life. I could actually feel my uterus repeatedly, violently contracting when I placed my hand on my pelvis. Very heavy bleeding. Along with other muscle spasms in my legs and arms.   Most of Friday I was glued to the bed. Any movement was exhausting. The only way I could get any rest from the chills was with an electric blanket at max heat. I was trying to hydrate but then I always had to pee really bad and when I went to the bathroom not much came out.   Around 9pm on Friday, shortly after I took some ibuprofen, the chills turned into sweats. I was finally able to eat a little something and was able to pee. 12 hours of sleep later I was fine.   Day 4 I still have pain in my arm at the injection site but it lasted 4 days with the first shot as well.

                                                I received the vaccine and was unknowingly pregnant. My first shot was on 1/6/2021 and my second shot was on 1/27/2021. I conceived on  1/25/2021. I ended up miscarrying the child and when they sent it in for testing it had 2 abnormal chromosomes. One of which they said is very rare and they have no idea how or why the baby had this. I was told that the vaccine was supposed to be safe for pregnant people but with no family history of anything like this happening and no history of any children being born with mutations I believe this happened from the vaccine. Possibly caused by the spike in temperature I experienced after the second shot. I should have been due to deliver 10/2021.

During this time, I did not test positive for pregnancy. There were no other variables, no other medication changes, diet or exercise changes. After several tests, my doctors decided this was most likely a side effect of the vaccination I had received.

My mom is also experiencing period like cramps after her second dose and she went through menopause years ago.

ALSO, I experienced an enlarged and painful lymph node in my collar bone area which began a couple days after my vaccine dose and finally resolved as of 4/19/2021.

                                                My first 24 hours included sore arm, feeling hot with no fever, joint pain, and achiness. On 3/31/21, I began to experience extreme heartburn almost to the point of vomiting. I had a very sensitive stomach/reaction to food until Saturday 4/3/21.  I was not able to eat a lot and felt generally unwell. In addition, my menstrual cycle began Sunday 4/25/21 when it was not set to begin until Tuesday 4/27/21, I have not yet seen if it&#39;s heavier than normal.

Period started a week early on 4/22 and is still going on. Usually done within 5 days and not nearly as heavy with clots like this. ER suggested I report a possible correlation between that and the vaccine as they have seen it with other patients as well. ER doctor medicated with birth control hormones to slow down bleeding.

                                                4 1/2 hours following vaccination, I began experiencing anticipated common side effects (sore injection site, fatigue). I finished working remotely without issue at 17:00, and noticed that I felt unusually warm and my face was flushed. Took my temperature and was running a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Minor side effects presented over the course of the evening and by 22:15, I had a headache and muscles and joints were painful. Next morning (4/17/21) I began my menstrual cycle. I immediately noticed it was significantly heavier, thicker and a bright red color. It was not anything I had ever experienced before, and was a little uneasy. The rate at which I was having to change tampons was overwhelming, but I had a feeling it had possibly to due with receiving my second dose. The cycle continued in this manner for another 3 days, which is also not typical for me, as it usually lasts a full week.

                                                On April 12, shortly after I got my second Pfizer shot, I started my period. It was very early by several weeks, and only a week since my previous period ended, which is why I made note of it and have kept a record.  For the first week it was fairly light and mostly spotting. After a week, it progressed and became more like a normal period in terms of the amount of blood I was seeing. By April 23rd I started noticing a lot more blood clots in my period than usual--ordinarily I&#39;ll see one or two each time I get my period, but there were about five days in a row when I noticed multiple blood clots. The clots stopped around April 28th, but as of today (May 3rd) my period is still ongoing, making it exactly three weeks long, and more unless it suddenly stops today.  For the most part the blood has been red and I haven&#39;t noticed any other unusual discharge. I have noticed the past few days that the blood is more brown, like old blood.  I have not experienced bad cramps or stomach upset during this very long period--I had the same level of menstrual cramping/stomach upset that I am accustomed to over the first couple of days, but nothing since then. I have felt bloated and tired the entire time, however. I have also experienced a really low mood for these few weeks, though I can&#39;t be certain if this is worse than I usually experience on my period, because it may just be because it&#39;s lasting so long that it feels worse.

My first period after my first shot was so heavy i was having to change my pad and tampon 3-5 times in a day.  After 7 days of heavy bleeding, I started passing large blood clots along with the bleeding.  I would pass a large blood clot roughly once an hour.  I got the second vaccination on the 11th day of this bleeding.  After 14 days, the period stopped only to start again after one day.  I am currently on the 16th day of bleeding.  There is also intense cramping associated with the blood clots.

Lymph nodes swollen throughout body.  Later in the date the injection site swelled, became red.  It has been itching  continuously for the last 3 weeks.  Also, since the vaccine when I&#39;ve been bitten by mosquitos, the bite becomes highly inflamed and sore to the touch.  Almost like a chicken pox.  Digestive issues also started, with diarrhea nearly every day since the first dose.    I missed my period, with my menstrual cycle being delayed two weeks.  Once it did come, it was much heavier than normal.  My lymph nodes are still swollen, especially in my groin area.  I am due for my second dose tomorrow, but don&#39;t know if I should still get it with the adverse symptoms of my first dose still very much present and affecting me.

Spotting is not a normal occurrence in my menstrual cycle.  April 28 was day 23 of my cycle.  My cycles are usually around 35-45 days long.  The spotting started out as brown/pink.  It was light for the first few days.   I have been spotting every day since getting the vaccine.  It has progressively gotten heavier and requires pads.   It is red and there is also  dark brown blood.  I have been bleeding for 8 days.  It is ongoing and has not stopped.

                                                I continued to have my period since the vaccine. I was on day 6 or 7 of period when I received the second COVID 19 vaccine.  I am currently on week 3 with continued abnormal uterine bleeding. I have only had a day or two break twice during the last 3 weeks but every time, my period restarts. Currently still bleeding and waiting to see an OB-GYN specialist. I have always had regular monthly periods prior to the vaccine.  I am a physician myself. I completed pregnancy test and it is negative. Waiting on further studies and evaluation.

                                                Worst back and spinal pain of my life beginning about 10 hours after injection, lasting approximately 24 hours. Felt like labor contractions limited to my spine. Every nerve felt as if it was on fire. Accompanied by racing heartbeat, extreme chills, and fever.  Pain began in neck, moved to both shoulders, down the spine, and into pelvis. Finished with intense headache and a fever of 104.1. Once fever broke, back pain subsided. Two days later I am left with utter exhaustion. Tylenol was administered at 4 hour intervals and only took the edge off the pain.

                                                My menstrual period, which started on the day of my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, was unusually painful and was accompanied by diarrhea.  A month later, my next period is once again more painful than usual. In a normal month, I would only experience 1?2 days of painful cramps that require Ibuprofen. However, I am now on my 4th day of painful cramps. I completely understand that there is a chance these aberrant periods are unrelated to the vaccine, but hearing about other women&#39;s experiences prompted me to report. I also experienced the normal side effects of the 2nd dose (obtained on 4/27/21 at the same pharmacy), including body aches, chills, and a mild fever starting ~12 h after the vaccine administration and ending by ~30 h post-vaccine. I also had a very sore left arm and sore swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit for 3?4 days following the administration of the second dose.

                                                One day after shot started to experience light cramping. Cramping continued, then had slight break through bleeding start on 5/10 and 5/11. On 5/12 menstrual  cycle began while on birth control-not supposed to have started for another week. Bleeding is intense and cramping pain increased. This also happened after the first dose but I didn&#39;t think too much of it at the time. It&#39;s happened again after 2nd dose.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for herself. A 34-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Apr2021 12:00 at 34 years old (Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Anemia, Depression, Chronic Dry Eye, penicillin allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lifitegrast (XIIDRA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and experienced drug allergy. An hour after the vaccine on 03Apr2021, patient&#39;s fingers were red and swollen (like after exercise on a hot day) and she was itchy all over her body. No symptoms for almost 4 days--then she started feeling intermittently dizzy/lightheaded, feverish every night (chills and hot flashes) for the next 4 nights. She got a wracking cough and was short of breath (couldn&#39;t climb a single flight of stairs without needing to lie down for several minutes). She was also extremely exhausted-- slept 20 hours in a single day. After multiple telemedicine and in-person appointments, a trip to urgent care, and a chest x-ray and CT, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with antibiotics, vitamin D, and two inhalers. She missed her period, had an elevated d-dimer, and her white blood cell count dropped from 7.0 Thousand u/L to 3.6. She was incapacitated for 2 weeks-- the sickest she had ever been in her life. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient performed Nasal Swab, negative on 11Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken for pneumonia. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Around the third day after the vaccine I had a slight fever and a migraine, that is when I went to seek care about the migraine and was prescribed Tylenol and ibuprofen .  After taking my medicine and resting for a few days since my job gave us a week off for receiving the vaccine they symptoms subsided. A few weeks later, I noticed that I didn&#39;t receive my monthly which should have shown up around the last week of each month. So when I went to my doctor for an appointment they gave me a blood test to check and make sure that I was not pregnant and the results came back negative.

The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. There were no concomitant medications (other medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination: no). Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), administered in the left arm, on 20Dec2021 at 10:00 (lot number not reported), at age 34 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported, &#34;My second dose of the vaccine was 10Jan2021. I conceived around 24Jan2021.

                                                At onset of monthly menstrual cycle, my PMS was much more severe than normal, and included severe pelvic pain, severe breast pain, migraine headache lasting three days, back pain, fatigue, nausea, and heavy menstrual bleeding. I have an IUD and I normally only experience spotting for 2-3 days during my cycle, so heavy bleeding is not normal for me.

                                                At 1:30pm on Monday 5/31 I started to feel cramps in my pelvic area. I had gotten my period 2 days early, and was bleeding heavier than normal and had surprising diarrhea. I took 600mg of Advil and texted a friend at 2:10 that: &#34;the womanly cramps are ripping up my insides and making me so sick.&#34; Still I though this was an incredibly painful but normal mensural cycle. By 2:45 when the Advil normally would have kicked in and made the cramping almost disappear, I had gotten much worse. I was spending the day with a friend who is an internal medicine doctor and so she monitored me closely. I had extreme chills and was very cold to the touch but was profosely sweating. I was unable to drink or eat anything due to the nausea. Sharp and constant pain radiated from my mid-pelvic area down to my knees and up to my chest. On a fairly consistent bases my legs contorted in involuntary cramping.    I felt like I was bleeding heavily (turns out I was not) and we attempted to go to the bathroom. I just the act of gently standing up I fainted and my friend caught me, gently returning me to the ground. When I became conscious she had my legs up and we went to the ER.

                                                I am a woman who has PCOS. My cycle is extremely inconsistent and never last more than a day maybe once every year or 2. Two weeks after my 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine I started my menstral cycle , experiencing cramps, discomfort, pressure in my uterus, blood clots daily, and so far it?s been for 8 days. I am not alarmed yet because I understand this might be natural but I am documenting this because it is out of the ordinary in my unique case.   I also experienced what seemed like a stomach flu for about 2 days On the 6th and 7th of June. Experiencing diarrhea, nausea, no fever, but heavy fatigue. I no longer feel sick but my period is still active.

Her cycle has been about 10 days longer with heavier flow since the first vaccine dose.

                                                I was approximately six weeks pregnant at time of my first vaccine. At subsequent OB visit three weeks later I had miscarried. It may not be related to the vaccine at all, but given this is a new vaccine and not studied in pregnant women I thought it was best to report it.

There were no complications with the miscarriage.

                                                1 week after first dose I got a red bumpy rash on back of elbows and inner thighs. Did teledoc visit and got prescribed steroid cream.  Dr said probably vaccine reaction. Was supposed to start menstrual cycle on 03/02/2021 and have yet to have any cycle at all. Brought up to Dr. and he didn?t have time to address it at that visit. It is abnormal for me to miss a cycle, I am surgically sterilized with no Fallopian tubes. Pregnancy not a possibility.

I started another period about 2 weeks after that one finished. There was about 3 weeks between that one and my next one. I have an IUD and have not had a true period since having it placed in April 2019. I have no reason to believe that my IUD is out of place, but it will be checked at my next OB appointment next month. I did speak with the OB office over the phone.

                                                Heavy period started a day after receiving the second covid-19 vaccination shot. I have an IUD and have not had a period other than light spotting for almost 5 years.  This lasted ~48 hours. It was an unexpected side effect. Reporting this after reading some articles on the subject that recommended reporting to VAERS to support in aggregating women?s experiences in case there is more that can be learned about why this happens.

                                                I felt mild symptoms the day after the vaccine (sore arm, headache, slight fever).  Otherwise I felt fine.  When I got my period three weeks after the vaccine, it was by far the worst period I&#39;ve had in years.  I have had terrible cramps for four days (even though I stopped bleeding on the third day).  I couldn&#39;t stand up straight for two days because the cramps were so bad and I had to stay in bed most of the time.  My period was heavier than normal with really big clots.  My digestion has been really impacted during this time, too.  Usually during my period, my digestion is very fast and my bowels clean out, but I&#39;ve been super constipated this time.  I also am having hot flashes.  The cramps are terrible.  None of the remedies I typically use for menstrual cramps are doing anything.  I track my cycle and am very aware of my body and what my periods are like and this has been absolutely unlike anything before.  I haven&#39;t had a period this bad since I was a teenager.  It actually felt a lot like my period was in reverse.  I didn&#39;t have normal PMS before I started - usually I have slightly cramps for a couple days in advance, as well as get emotional, constipated, backache.  The day that I started my period is the day that the horrible cramps started.  And once the bleeding ended and the cramps continued, I started to have the weird PMS symptoms - breast pain, back ache, moody, etc.

This is especially surprising given that I am on birth control pills to regulate my period due to PCOS and never experience early periods while on this medication.

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

After getting the shot I?ve had 3 separate instances of heavy spotting that lasted 2-3 days over the past month.  In addition, the shot seemed to affect my arthritis. The next day I woke up and pretty bad inflammation in almost every joint for almost a week. I?ve been recovering from long-covid since last December and had mostly recovered at time of 1st shot. I noticed since then a re-emergence of the fatigue and breathing issues. The re-emergence was not horrible or life threatening but very noticeable. I had a follow-up breathing test yesterday (05/20/2021) and there was a decline from the previous breathing test taken in March.

                                                severe breast pain, breast tissue formed into a large lump, menstruation began early - I took the first shot right before my menstruation and that night plus the following night I experienced the feeling of my breast being stabbed over and over. A few days later I found a large lump ontop of my breast over the nipple area. I went to a obgyn doctor who felt the lump and concluded it was probably breast tissue but wanted to re-check after the second Covid shot which I will get on the 15th of June.

                                                Prior to the vaccination I had a normal pregnancy. This was my first pregnancy. . No issues with me or fetus. I did receive the flu vaccine in the fall of 2020 but no other vaccines or medications than those previously reported. On 4/23/2021 I began experiencing a small amount of bloody discharge which continued for 10 days. I was evaluated in OB triage on 5/5 by exam, blood work and ultrasound. All tests came back normal and the pathology from discharge was blood and mucus. The discharge continued until 2 weeks later on 5/19 when it became brighter red. I was evaluated by OB triage again by exam and blood work with normal results. Cervix showed no signs of labor and I was not dilated. On 5/20 I began leaking amniotic fluid and my water broke. My son was born at 30 weeks and 3 days (due date 7/26/2021). He is in NICU as of this report but doing as well as could be expected.

                                                3 days after I received a first doze of Pfizer vaccine on May 13, I found out that I was pregnant, about 5 weeks. I consulted with my OBGYN and also called CDC phone number to consult regarding getting the 2nd doze, and both encouraged me to get the 2nd doze. My bloodwork showed low levels of progestrerone, so I was prescribed it to support the pregnancy.  My 2nd doze was on June 3, and on the next day after the vaccination I&#39;ve experienced strong vatigue, headache, and overall low-grade fever achy sensations.  On the 4th day after getting vaccinated with my 2nd doze, I got a terrible migrain that lasted for 48 hours; I was unable to keep any food or fluids in, and actually lost 7.5 lbs over the period of 2 days. A couple of days after that, I had a similar migraine that lasted by 24 hours, and I lost another 3 lbs.   Today, June 16, I came in for my 1st 10-week sonogram, only to find out that I had a Blighted Ovum Miscarriage. This is make it my 3rd pregnancy and my 3rd miscarrige. My OBGYN has ordered some blood tests, and we&#39;re trying to get as much information about the possible cause on our end.  In the meantime, I felt obligated to share my story in case the vaccine had any hand in this...  I get the flu shot every year, and I am pro vaccination. I&#39;ve been tested negative for COVID-19; prior to getting teh vcaccine I also checked for anti-bodies, and the result was negative as well.

                                                I just had my second shot yesterday morning. For the first dose, I didn&#39;t have any of the typical side effects other than sore arm. On June 4th, I started having vaginal bleeding. I called the on call triage and the bleeding was significant enough to go to ER. Was there and almost had a DNC at that point because the doctor felt the bleeding was so significant. But there was a wait in ER,  had an ultrasound, by that time bleeding slowed down and I went home with the caveat that if the bleeding returned to go to ER again. The doctor&#39;s were saying that a miscarriage was going to happen....so we were taking it day by day. 10 days later, I started bleeding again and then I miscarried on Tuesday of this week.  I started cramping at 1;:00 in the morning and felt the water break and then started bleeding heavily again at 03:00 in morning. Follow up with OB&#39;s on June 7th.  And I went to ER and once we got there and they checked the ultrasound and they couldn&#39;t see the baby any more and they had me go in to a D&amp;E.    Pregnancy - 3rd pregnancy - one live birth (my son); the first pregnancy was an elective abortion; Estimated date of delivery was going  to be December 1 (I was 15 weeks)

I&#39;m specifically reporting the second vaccine dose because of how abnormal menstruation was.  The second does I menstruated starting the day after I received my vaccine for 6 days (normal length of cycle and bleeding quantity). 7 days after stopping menstruating I seemed to menstruate again for 1 day (medium quantity of bleeding). Bleeding stopped for an additional 5 days. I then started menstruating again for 13 days.  My normal cycle lasts 7 days on average. I very rarely menstruate every month (usually it&#39;s every 2 months or more) and I&#39;ve never before menstruated twice within a month.  I also experience swollen lymph nodes in my underarm on the left side of my body (same side as injection site) the day after my vaccine.

After my second shot I should have gotten my period a week later, but it skipped with no bleeding at all.  When it finally did come it was one of the longest and heaviest periods since I had given birth 2 years prior.   Then when I started the pill after that period I continued to have breakthrough bleeding the entire month of that pill pack.  I?ve been on this pill since I was 15 and had never experienced this.

The nurse on call advised me to go to the ER. I went to ER, they ran an ultra sound and all kinds of test, they said everything looked good they thought it was a Fibroid. They discharged me, and that night at 11:30pm I had a very big and fast bleed around a cup of blood and went back to the ER. That time I went to hospital because it was closer. Again they did an ultrasound and thought it was a Fibroid. I ended up seeing my OB GYN 2/8/21, she said she didn&#39;t think it was a Fibroid and sent me to get an ultrasound on 2/12/21. At that point after the bleed I had 4 days of spotting. When I went to the ultrasound they said I had a partial placenta abruption and my cervex has shortened. Since then everything has been fine.

Prior to this most recent miscarriage I had 3 previous miscarriages and 1 live birth (1 living child).  To be clear, I do not blame the vaccine for the miscarriage, the chromosomes of the embryo were determined before I got my first Covid vaccine.

                                                Menstruation: I received my vaccine late night March 30 and was fatigued and slept most of the next afternoon and through the night. I began my period on April 1, which is around the usual time. Everything seemed fine for that first week (flow, discomfort levels, mood, etc.). but I still haven&#39;t stopped bleeding (as of April 15), which is completely abnormal; today marks two straight weeks of menstruating. Within this second week, there is significantly more cramping and back pain than usual, and my flow is very heavy with frequent large, thick clots passing in the blood, some globules the size of quarters or even half-dollars (though amorphously shaped). I go back for my second dose on April 22, and have a scheduled doctor&#39;s appointment on April 28.

                                                I&#39;ve always been very aware of my menstrual cycle as my body gives significant signs. My cycle has always been regular, with only a maximum of three days or less difference. Interestingly, a day after my first vaccine dose, I told those around me the symptoms were very similar to when I&#39;m about to menstruate but worse.   Tonight after about a week, very oddly, my cycle started 10 days early. Additionally, the color also looks different from what it looks like normally. It is usually ranges between dark red and brighter red but today, it has a notable purple tinge to it.   After an internet search, there is article where it seems other women are also experiencing significant shifts in their cycles. And as I&#39;m not one who normally pays much attention to health changes, this was significant enough for me to feel incentivized to report this. It is also quite troubling and is increasing a bit of anxiety on how the second dose may impact the hormones. I really hope there are better studies on how the vaccine can affect hormones as it can cause havoc with the body.

                                                The day after receiving my first vaccine, I began to develop a headache and fatigued. I was unable to move my left arm much higher than an inch or two. My arm pain got better after 24 hours, but the headache and fatigue persisted. I felt well enough to work on April 12, 13 and 14 and went outside my home on the 12, 14 and 15, interacting with other people while masked. On April 16, the extreme fatigue set in. I could not get out of bed. EXTREME. That entire weekend I stayed in bed with the chills and also developed nasal congestion that has persisted to the time of this writing (April 23). On April 19, I started spotting and started my period (old blood) two weeks early. That has for the most part subsided to the level of my usual discharge, though it is a bit heavier than normal.  Also on April 19, the sore throat and chest pain started. I went for a COVID test today. Negative result. Chest pain is similar in location and scope to when I suffered with pericarditis years ago.  Took a sick day off of work. Fatigue getting better, but very very wiped out by the end of the day. Brain is foggy.  April 20 - virtual visit with my primary doctor to discuss symptoms. Chest pain continually getting worse, harder to take a deep breath, like when the doctor asks to &#34;take a deep breath and hold it,&#34; that really hurts. Can breathe regularly fine. But just sitting on the couch I&#39;m in pain. Laying down hurts the most. Get bloodwork, chest x-ray and covid test done. All normal.   April 22 - Chest pain continues to get worse. Starting to cough. Go to Urgent Care  at request of primary care doctor. Another covid test done, xray taken, flu swab., EKG. All normal. They send me to emergency room at  Hospital additonal assessment. EKG, ultrasound of heart and lungs, bloodwork done, all normal. They send me home on ibuprofin and tell me to follow up with my cardiologist. They believe it to be presumptive pericarditis.

Four hours after I started having stomach pains that were sharp and burning, they would come in waves. Injection site started to be warm, firm, and hurt a lot. Ten hours after vaccination I started feeling more stomach pains as well as bloating, lower back/hipside pains, mid upperback discomfort below ribcage and 99.1 fever with chills. 12 Hours after vaccination I continued to feel bloating, stomach discomfort, chills, but also headache and increased heart rate and over all unwell feelings. Throughout night from midnight until 3:30 am I would wake up with increased heart rate and feeling hot and stomach bloating and discomfort. Heart rate would range from 82-100 bpm resting and fever never went past 100 degrees with one does of 500 mg tylenol. The next morning I continued to have stomach discomfort in upper stomach right under ribcage on both sides, mild bloating, nausae, on and off side and mid back under ribcage discomfort, and 99.2 degree fever with no medication. A week later my period started (on time) but a lot heavier than normal, with larger clots and headache/neck pain and extreme fatigue.

It was accompanied by much more intense pain and cramping, as well as intense suicidal ideation. That period ended after a very heavy bleeding of 4 days. I got the second shot just before my 37th birthday and the very next day felt terrible. My entire body hurt in a way I have never experienced before. My feet hurt, my hips, extreme fatigue. That continues in varying severity. I started spotting again on April 19th, which continues until I started another period on April 23rd which just ended yesterday, the 26th. I am still very fatigued and have been dealing with extreme suicidal thoughts and uncontrollable crying.

I developed chills, a 102 F fever, and my skin hurt. My arm also hurt very badly and I had trouble moving it. The reason for reporting, is I also had some odd side effects I&#39;m not seeing reported. I also experienced extreme vaginal dryness 24-48 hours after the vaccination. I use the Nuva Ring and it actually stuck to the inside of me. It was very painful. I also started my period two weeks early. The vaginal dryness continues while I had my period. My period lasted 6 days. On the 5th day of my period the vaginal dryness diminished. It was very odd having vaginal dryness while I had my period. Fortunately that is gone and I have recovered.

                                                Vaginal bleeding.  Light spotting the day after vaccine which continued into the next day as well as the wound day which was heavier bleeding.   On day 13 of cycle on the day of vaccination.  Mid cycle spotting/bleeding is highly unusual for me.

                                                My period started around the time it was supposed to after the first does on March 18. The blood flow began on March 30th and was more heavier than normal with abnormally large sized blood clots passing. The flow was extra heavy for about 2-3 days, then light for one day, and only spotting (some residual blood when wiping) for four days. Right now my period is due to begin and it is slightly late and I just had the second shot on Monday.

                                                I experienced extreme abdominal pain, syncopal episode and collapse on 3/30/21, and was taken to the hospital ER. The pain subsided in a few hours and was determined by the hospital doctor and my primary care doctor to be extreme ovulation pain, which I had never experienced before.   I received my 2nd COVID Pfizer vaccine on 4/7/21.  My menstrual period was then 1 week late, beginning 4/22/21, with four full days of extreme menstrual/abdominal cramps. The pain level and duration was at least twice that of my regular cycle pain.

Everything was fine the first day but by the afternoon of day 2 I was bleeding extremely heavy and several very large blood clots past in a matter of minutes. I called consulting nurse who told me to go to the ER immediately. I then went to the ER for treatment. They did some tests and sent me home and told me to watch my symptoms closely for the next few days. This was last night and I have no change today. I&#39;m still bleeding very heavily and passing large clots. I have never in my life experienced a period of this nature.

I started my period 5/10/21. 8 days early. Exactly 14 days from my second shot. This means I ovulated on the day of my second dose. My cycles was 22 days. There is no explanation for this other than the shot made me ovulate early.  This is terrifying. I could have become unintentionally pregnant.  I am on day 3 of this period and it is by far the heaviest bleeding I have ever experienced in my life.

Nine days after the first Pfizer dose I had a heavy period. I had the second dose on 5/6/2021 and had started a light period the next day. It lasted for five days, stopped for three and I&#39;m now bleeding again. It started on 5/15/21 and is now 5/20/21..  After the first dose I also had body aches, fever and chills which cleared up after three days.

I let the facility know but at the time they thought maybe it was just anxiety so I stayed for about an hour near the facility just in case and then went directly to my doctors office.  Chest tightness and tachycardia. It stopped for 5 days and on 5th day my pulse was 122 and tightness in my heart became a regular symptom .At worst my pulse was 133. It should be in the low 80?s.   A month later  I still get some tightness in my heart area / chest . My D Dimer is double what it should be and my blood was so thick 3 weeks post vaccine it took 6-8 sticks to get blood from me which is not normal for me.   I also had a lot muscle pain throughout body the first week after vaccine , some headache , a worse than normal period but the heart reaction has been the most concerning.

                                                Approximately 10 days after second Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine dose, I had an extremely heavy period unlike any period I?ve ever had. I had to stay home for several days because of how unusually heavy it was. The period also lasted much longer than my normal period. I was so worried about the intensity of this cycle that I called my GYN and went in for a visit. She performed a Pap smear, blood test, and ultrasound of my ovaries and uterus. Everything came back normal and my GYN said the cause of my abnormally heavy period was unknown. It wasn?t until I saw a news report of other women having changes in their cycles that I thought what I experienced might be related to the Covid vaccine.

I was barely making it through the work day. That continued for another week but then began getting worse. The low energy and tiredness got significantly worse the week of 3/8. It had gotten to a point that I was starting to miss work. Also, I had menstrual spotting that started right around the date of vaccination. This lasted about 3 weeks. It lasted from about 2/22-3/12. I was taking ibuprofen and a topical patch (salonpas) for the joint pain. This helped a little.

I had a hormonal IUD that came out over the course of the menstrual cycle. In 01/2020, I had surgery in regards to my endometriosis and things were normal until this. Between the orilissa and the IUD with help with maintaining a normal cycle so this was very abnormal. I went to the doctor who did an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed uterine polyps that were not there back on February and that my IUD was out of place.  I had anemia from such a heavy menstrual cycle. The fatigue had gotten worse. The joint pain continued as well but was on the back burner with respect to the fatigue and menstrual cycle.

                                                I had uterine cramping the next morning 6/12 I woke up to it. Later that evening I started to experience heart palpations only when I laid down. Pain in the left arm beyond the injection site, entire left arm and left chest around where my heart is located. I had break through bleeding not related to my mensural cycle that lasted for a day, it was moderate and not anything severe. Extreme fatigue, all of which I was surprised. Also at one point experienced pain in my left scapula and that was really it. But the symptoms lasted I would say a little over a week. So I went to the Doctor, a Hematologist because I have sickle cell disease and Beta Thalassemia.

I had to fully lay down and couldn?t carry my 15lb son. I also had marked breast tenderness greater on the side of the injection. My son seemed to have trouble staying latched (?due to tiredness from my direct warmth), and had increased fussiness.

                                                1:45 driving home, started to notice weird feeling like I had an allergy shot. 2:30 I got home and breathing was aggravated. 2 puffs of inhaler, sat down and waited. Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

                                                First shot: 7 hours after my first dose I experienced low fever 100.2 that last 2 days as well as chills. Severe pain in my left arm that subsided in about 24 hours. In addition , the first 48 hours I couldn&#39;t sleep. Slept 3 hours those nights despite feeling extremely tired. Brain fog and severe fatigue persisted for a full 7 days after the first shot.   Second shot: 12 hours after my second dose, around 10 pm that night sudden onset of fever, this time higher, rose to 101. Severe chills, nausea, diarrhea. These severe, flu-like symptoms lasted a little over 24 hours and then improved significantly. However, the stomach pains continued and the next morning (so about 24 hours after the second shot), I had heavy vaginal bleeding and cramping. This happened 21 days into my cycle and is highly abnormal for me. My cycle is regular and runs between 28 and 31 days, usually on the longer side. I track my periods, in the last 3 years it&#39;s never been 21 days and I&#39;ve never had sudden onset of heavy bleeding like this, it always starts lighter and intensifies. Heavy bleeding continues as I&#39;m writing this report. This is much heavier than usual for the full 6 days so far and seems to be getting heavier, not lighter as I would expect it to by day 6/7 certainly.

I?m also having some nerve pain in the arm that was previously injured (left arm) and it?s falling asleep at night and worsening of that arm pain/weakness even though I?ve been resting it for two weeks. I?m also having scalp pain at the hair roots at the top of my head. My breasts are also very sore and enlarged, with lumps in my right breast which started after my first dose but have been progressively worse. I haven?t gotten my period, it?s over 40 days late.

Overall it has not stopped. Prior to the Covid shot, my periods were very normal and on time every 5 weeks.

                                                After getting vaccinated on 3/3/21 and 3/24/21, I missed a menstrual period.  I had my doctor complete a whole bunch of tests and nothing came back to explain the missed menstrual cycle.  I am not pregnant, my blood and urine samples confirmed.  There is no other changes to my health that would affect my menstrual cycle.

Hours later I experienced heavy lower back pressure that I attributed to my period so did yoga and stretched for relief. In the following days, when I would be nearing the end of my period (and should have only light bleeding), I  have since continued to experience an extremely heavy flow with what feels like moderate menstrual cramping with no change in these side effects.

Pain over ovaries/uterus lasting for 1 week starting 1 day after vaccine.  On 4/14 I began my first menstrual cycle after the vaccine. On 4/17 I experienced heavier than normal bleeding, bloating and cramping. With this was extreme abnormal mood swings, severe depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, insomnia lasting severely for 3 days. I called my psychologist, spoke to the nurse at my clinic and many others because it was too much to handle. I have never experienced this to this degree in my life. Since 4/19 the mood swings and mood changes have mellowed but are still present today along with low back pain, cramping, bleeding and extreme exhaustion. I have been bleeding for 12 days. I usually bleed for 6-8 days. I usually only experience PMS for 1-2 days.

                                                I have had a prolonged period and then it started again halfway through the cycle  I have been on Yaz birth control for almost 10 years. My period is always very regular, starting on Tuesday and ending on Friday. It is always also light. This month it started as regular on April 6 (same day as first dose of Pfizer vaccine) but did not end until the following Wednesday, April 14. It was heavier than normal. Then my period started again on April 22 and is still on-going (today is April 27). I am not stressed in any way, not about the vaccine or any other life circumstances, I am not sick, I have not had anything else different in my life other than taking the Covid Pfizer vaccine on April 6. I am not pregnant. Nothing else is weird with my body. I did just get the 2nd Covid Pfizer vaccine shot about 30 minutes ago and felt that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the inconvenience of this very odd period cycle, but I definitely wanted to report it to help the data and to help other women who may be going through the same thing.  I spoke with my primary care provider who wasn&#39;t able to find any data about it in the Pfizer vaccine side effects list, because it wasn&#39;t looked at when the initial studies were done. He referred me to an OB/GYN but that appointment isn&#39;t for another couple of weeks.

My OBGYN verified I had a negative pregnancy test.

Then by the next morning, 4/18, I had a big red painful rash/inflammation on my left upper arm, and felt horrible exhausted no energy. The rash and symptoms lasted for about 3 days, then the rash, pain, and exhaustion went away.   Then the next symptom I had was in regards to my monthly period cycle. It was very late, and ended up coming 5 days after schedule, and I had extremely bad cramping before my period actually came. Which is not typical for me.

                                                Within minutes of getting administered the shot, my entire body started to sweat, and I got very intense nausea and period cramps that was 8/10 on pain scale. I was moaning and crying and didn&#39;t know what to do. After they came to check on me about 15 minutes later, I asked if I could take Advil and they said I could so I did. I also told them I felt like I was going to throw up, so they gave me this bin, and I threw up twice.  I was supposed to get my period later that day or the next day, but it hadn&#39;t started yet and I felt completely fine when I first got there before I got the shot. But it was almost instantaneous after the shot that I had the sweating, nausea, and period cramps that made me feel like I couldn&#39;t walk or talk because I was in so much pain. I kept wanting to be crouched down and also to have my head down. The nurse kept asking me what I needed, and I didn&#39;t know, I just kept saying, &#34;I don&#39;t feel good, I don&#39;t feel good.&#34; I eventually asked to go to the bathroom because I thought that might help even though I didn&#39;t actually have to go. They took me to the bathroom where I kept moaning and crying and felt so awful. Only a couple times did the pain subside for about 5 seconds but then came right back. I think it was probably an hour of this when they called the paramedics to take me to the emergency room. But as soon as they arrived to the women&#39;s bathroom in the mall where we were, the pain finally subsided. They still wanted to take me to the ER, but I convinced them not to because I was feeling better and worried about the bill I would receive and dealing with all the insurance stuff. They eventually agreed to let me stay in my car 30 more minutes while being monitored. The nurses were all very nice and gave me juice and snacks to help the nausea, and then they scheduled my next appointment at the hospital and told me I should come with someone next time. When I got home I noticed my arm was sore, but I knew that was normal so wasn&#39;t too worried about it. However it&#39;s now been sore almost three weeks, and I can&#39;t move it certain directions, which is super frustrating because I&#39;ve been pursuing dance outside of my day job and hadn&#39;t gotten an injury from that all year, but now all of a sudden I can&#39;t move my arm a lot of ways and it&#39;s affected me being able to take class and do choreography, and also regular household things. I can&#39;t reach with my left arm to grab things, and I can&#39;t ever tense the muscle in my upper left arm / shoulder, and if it tenses by accident (i.e. I go to grab something that&#39;s falling or see a bug), pain shoots through. And now I have read about vaccines causing shoulder injuries, and I&#39;m feeling quite frustrated, which is what led me to find this vaccine report site, and is why I am probably going to cancel my second dose appointment.

                                                The event started on Tuesday, April 20-- the day after my first dose of Pfizer vaccine. My menstrual cycle began two days early (I typically have a regular cycle) and have experienced spotting continuously since ovulation. My period was heavier than usual and I experienced symptoms that were longer in duration, greater in intensity and/or that I do not typically experience during menstruation.  Abdominal cramps were worse and lasted longer into my cycle by a few days. I also experienced breast pain over several days, which is not a symptom I typically experience at all. Spotting occurred at, or shortly after, ovulation and has not ceased (I am currently on day 15 of my cycle; spotting since day 11). This is also not typical for me. I have also experienced more headaches than usual in the past two weeks.

                                                After getting my first Pfizer shot on 3/17, menstruation was delayed by a few days.  It was lighter than normal but lasted a typical 5 days.  I was off my period for 5 days, then it started again and continued for 4 weeks.  Period was light but more than spotting.  It ended and now am late for a regular cycle.  In the two weeks after my first dose of the vaccine, I had several dizzy spells (felt like vertigo with a pounding pressure in my chest) but no other symptoms.  I got the second vaccine in early April.  In mid-April, I started wearing a heart monitor due to the chest pressure and dizziness.  I had several episodes of bradycardia and heart pauses (for up to 7 seconds).  This may have started prior to the first vaccine, but was worse in mid-to-late April.  I received a pacemaker April 30.

This was my third pregnancy. I became pregnant in March with positive tests on 4/19, 4/20, and 4/21. I had the Covid vaccine 4/21 and by 4/23 was suddenly in pain and bleeding, which continued for six days, after which my body began to recover. Additionally, I began to suffer breathing trouble, waking in the night, heart pounding (no nightmares or fears) and gasping. Was prescribed two inhalers to recover.

And now it has been 6.5 weeks since that period with no spotting or period.

A 37-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON); levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN); cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY); fluticasone propionate (FLONASE ALLERGY RELIEF), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 04Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number: EN6206) for COVID-19 immunization. On 28Apr2021 at 14:30, the patient experienced heavy bleeding including passing a blood clot with her first cycle after my second dose. The have NEVER bleed like this except for when she was having a miscarriage or postpartum after giving birth to her daughters. She usually can go all day with the same pad and soaked through a pad and her underwear was completely bloody in 3 hours (it was so bad I discarded the underwear). When she got on the toilet it kept gushing out and that was when she passed a clot. After that the bleeding slowed down. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient did not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

                                                First dose (administered 4/16/2021) resulted in an extremely sore arm at the injection site. Soreness lasted for about 4 days.  Second dose (administered 5/7/2021) resulted in an extremely sore arm at the injection site. Soreness lasted about 7 days. Within about 24-26 hours after the injection I felt very sick. I had chills, body aches, and a headache. Symptoms lasted about 24 hours. My menstrual cycle has also been delayed. I have always had very regular cycles for 25 years, but at the time of this submission I&#39;m about 4 days later than usual and my cycle has not started yet. (My husband had a vasectomy approximately 3.5 years ago, so pregnancy is unlikely.)

My sinuses and breathing passages swelled. The swelling went down gradually within 24 hours or so, but since then my lips and the area surrounding them have remained numb and it hasn&#39;t gone away. Hurts a bit to smile. I kept waiting for it to end so I could report what happened as far as duration, but it hasn&#39;t ended. I&#39;m slightly angry about this and also recognize it is what it is.  I regret getting this vaccine for sure though knowing it was a rushed process!  I called my doctor today and have an appointment next week to discuss my allergies and reactions in general.  Other reactions that happened but not sure if they are related -- intense, long lasting menstrual cramps post shot (just way more than usual) and blood for several days in my bowl movements. Those two items have subsided.

A 37-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 4:00 pm (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There are no patient history and concomitant medications. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Patient is healthy. She hasn&#39;t had vaccines since she was a child. Patient experienced unexpected menstrual period from 13Apr2021 and ongoing. Caller thought she was having a side effect to the COVID vaccine. She was having unexpected vaginal bleeding. She got the Pfizer COVID vaccine, first dose. Caller declined email. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. This was the first dose. She got the first dose on 07Apr2021, and then started bleeding the 13Apr2021. She thought it was gone last night, but then this morning it is more like a menstrual period. She had her period for 6 days, and it ended 4 days ago. Her period ended. She has never had unexpected bleeding. Her period was always on time and normal. She was pretty sure it was another period. It was weird because she felt like her breast were sensitive and more larger like when she got her period. She was confused for 2 days because she didn&#39;t understand why she felt like that. Then, she started bleeding. She scheduled her second dose. She has misplaced the card with the NDC/lot/expiration. She only has her receipt. She would like to know the ingredients of the vaccine. No emergency room and physician office visit. But she was going to the doctor Friday to talk to her. No investigation assessment. No relevant tests. The event outcome for unexpected menstrual period was not recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Normally during my period, I have one or two days of heavy bleeding, and one or two days of feeling more tired than usual. This time, I had two days of heavy bleeding. What was unusual was that the second day was extremely heavy, and I was extremely fatigued. I had to change my pads more frequently than usual, and saw multiple small blood clots in the toilet which is unusual for me. For about one and a half days I felt extremely fatigued and lightheaded, and for a short time nauseous, all of which is not normal for me. Also unusual was that I had a tight feeling in my calf muscles, similar to feeling swollen, but they looked normal. The fatigue was so bad that I had to call a sick day at work; something I never have to do because of my period. The fatigue lasted for several more days.

This  37- year-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Apr2021 at 12:00 (as reported) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included magnesium, calcium, vitamin D3, and probiotics from unknown dates for unspecified indications and omega 3 from an unknown date to two weeks prior to the second shot for an unknown indication. The patient did not have any known allergies. The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 03Apr2021 at 12:00 (as reported) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. On 05May2021 at 09:00 (as reported), the patient experienced first day very bad dull headache in middle of brain, second day sweaty hands. She also experienced drop in blood sugar, and gas bloating. She was due to get her menstrual cycle 13May2021 or a day or two prior in schedule. A few days after the second dose she had acne on her cheeks, little red zits with no heads. She never had those before. Two weeks after the second dose her injection site hurt similar to the second day or that second dose. It was her right arm this time where she got the second dose. It was on and off for 3 to 4 days. She had mild nose bleeds that started in the right nostril mainly in the morning. She had done nothing different including no changes to the environment. It lasted about a week. Now (on an unspecified date) her period was late and she had weird cramping. She was not sexually active; no risk of pregnancy. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcomes of headache, sweaty hands, drop in blood sugar, gas bloating, acne, zits, injection site hurt, nose bleeds, period was late, and cramping were recovering with lasting effects. It was also reported that since the vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Stopped after 7 daysTwo days after second vaccine, extreme bleeding for 3 full weeks so heavy; received dose1 and dose 2 on 08Apr2021; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 37-years-old female patient (not pregnant at time of vaccination) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Apr2021 13:00 at the age of 37-years-old(Batch/Lot Number: EW0179) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Leg Left on 08Apr2021 at the age of 37-years-old (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included covid-19 from an unknown date, Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. IUD from an unknown date, having little to no period with IUD. Concomitant medication included bupropion hydrochloride (BUPROPION) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient stated despite having little to no period with IUD, two days (as reported) post first vaccine onset of early, heavy bleeding on 01May2021 08:00. Stopped after 7 days. Two days (as reported) after second vaccine, extreme bleeding for 3 full weeks so heavy that her body expelled her IUD. Sought treatment from OBGYN. Had to take four progesterone pills a day for four days to get bleeding to stop and was still taking them 6 weeks after vaccine. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event bleeding included progesterone and scheduled uterine ablation. The outcome of the event heavy bleeding was resolving.

                                                Symptoms, most severe to least:  Seizure (non-epileptic):   3:05-3-45pm, May 12th, 2021 2:55-3:25am, May 15th, 2021 Approx 1-2pm, May 27th, 2021 4:45-5:20, June 6th, 2021  These are a half-hour&#43; of jerking (arms and legs) many times a minute, back arching, muscle locks, and muscle spasms. I retain consciousness and control between jerks, usually, though they are very painful and exhausting.   Note: I do have a medical history of Tourette?s, so these non-epileptic seizures are not new to me, and are generally manageable at home with hydration and safety practices unless they last more than a few hours. But I hadn?t had any in a couple years prior to the shot, as they are far more rare than they were a decade ago.  Weakness (cannot walk or stand unsupported, cannot lift heavy (and sometimes even light) objects, wobbly legs, shaky arms, etc.) 2:50pm, May 12th to present  This weakness rapidly increased from wobbly legs in the waiting room to unable to walk on my own or stand unsupported. It was extremely bad the first few days, then from May 17th seemed to slowly get a bit better day by day as I could walk a few steps and lift a jug of milk, then relapsed and has varied in terms of how extreme it is day by day. Currently I am using a walker to get around the house, except on days where I am too weak for that and have to stay mostly in bed.   Weakness on evening of Jun 1st was so bad that my head felt like a bowling ball I was trying to balance, and I could not hold my head up unassisted as it would fall forward, backward, or to the side. I went to bed early (7:30 about) and in the morning I could move my head again normally.  Lots of falls and partial falls (Often body ?locks down? after a fall and I cannot move my legs, and sometimes arms, to get up again unassisted, so I?ve been on the floor 5&#43; minutes.) Most falls from standing or walking position, but a few have been from sitting or kneeling. Some of these feel like legs or back giving out due to weakness, others feel like my legs or back just stopped working right.  Dizzines:  2:45pm, May 12th to Evening May 14th  It?s been on/off since, but has mostly cleared up.  Severe Fatigue: 3:00pm, May 12th to present Very tired, need a lot of extra sleep, hard to focus on things. Even climbing stairs or walking a bit with the walker can be exhausting and I need a long break of sitting to recuperate. Some days am so weak and tired I have to stay in bed, and can?t get much done. Pain: May 12th to present. It increases with activity and sometimes at night in back/right hip/left wrist especially. Left wrist is the most severe in persistence ? it will often buckle in pain if I try to support myself with it or catch myself from a fall with it. Pain in my right leg was also so bad the night of the 13th it was difficult to sleep. My spine, left wrist, and right hip/pelvis seem to have the worst on/off pain, though my back and legs often ache a lot in the early morning.  ?Glitchy? muscles: May 12th to present, worsening. Goes along with the weakness, but it feels like a muscle (especially legs) will glitch out and not work right. This slowly got worse for about a week after the shot, and has been pretty bad since. While sometimes the glitching causes my legs to buckle or I?ll drop something because my hand releases, it more commonly is just weird things like my legs and feet turning sideways or pointing weird.  Minor to moderate stabby headache:  2:50pm 12th to present, intermittent, managed by Tylenol. It was worse the first week after, but now seems to be every few days.  Earaches:  ~May 17th  to present. On and off, often accompany headaches - every few days. Both ears, sometimes just right.   Sore arm: From injection around 2:40pm May 12th to morning of the 14th There are spots in the upper left arm which are still sore when pressed. As mentioned under the pain section, my left wrist still hurts immensely when weight is put on it.  Minor Fever (estimate 99-100 degrees max) and/or Hot/Cold flashes:  Had chills and low fevers? It seemed on and off for a few days after the vaccine, so more than just recorded.   Night of the 12th, broke around 2am on the 13th Night of the 14th, broke around 2:45am on the 15th Afternoon of the 15th, broke around 6pm  June 9th, some of the day on and off   Abdominal Cramps &amp; nasuea: 12th-14th (not on period or pregnant at that time.)  Bowl issues: Mild Diarrhea for a couple of weeks after the shot. It also was more difficult to go pee/empty my bladder, as muscles seemed week and it could take 20 minutes to empty my bladder incrementally. I also had some minor leaking. This cleared up, though, no current bowl issues.  Shortness of breath:  Mild shortness of breath after the shot for a couple days where I could not speak at extra volume, read aloud or talk for a length of time, or take ?deep? breaths. This has mostly resolved though sometimes I will briefly get a little short of breath.  Muscle twitching and jerks: Since childhood. Since May 12th it has been worse than in the past few years, though. Started calming down a bit about June 10th.  Brain fog: For about a month after the shot, it was really hard to focus or keep on top of things. It got to the point my kids would literally move my head towards them and say, &#34;mommy, you aren&#39;t listening!&#34; to get my attention, and my sister and others also complained that I wasn&#39;t focusing on them. It was really hard to manage paperwork and arranging doctors as well.

I started to feel more emotional, I had a harder time to cope with everything around me, very hormonal. Started seeing a therapist May 4th, 2021. Around mid-May, I started feeling cramping, menstrual spotting in between periods which caused me to go through a spiral and seek a therapist. I&#39;m feeling better now physically.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

                                                7 days after my first Pfizer COVID vaccine, I developed mastitis. It began in the morning with mild generalized muscle and joint pain and progressed to moderate to severe joint pain, a fever of 102 degrees, and localized redness and swelling of the left breast over the course of 12 hours. Treatment with Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 14 days was initiated within 12 hours of onset. The systemic symptoms resolved within 24 hours of treatment onset and the breast redness and swelling resolved within 72 hours.   While I am aware that an infectious mastitis is likely unrelated to the vaccine, I opted to report this incident because I have breastfed 3 children and have never had mastitis prior to this event  and because of the limited information available on this vaccine in lactating women.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscularly on the left arm, on 07Jan2021 10:30, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer. Concomitant medication included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID). The patient previously took hydromorphone (DILAUDID) and metaxalone (SKELAXIN) and experienced allergies to both. The vaccine was given at the hospital. The patient stated that her menstrual cycle has been off and then it restarted with brown clotting old blood on 09Jan2021 (also reported as 24Jan2021); her period was not due for another 10 days. She added that her cycles have never been off, and she has never had issues with her menstrual cycles or any female problems. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit on 27Jan2021. Unspecified treatment was received for the adverse event. The outcome of the adverse event was unknown. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and have not been COVID tested post vaccination.

Patient miscarried at 12 weeks after receiving the second dose of vaccine. Dilation and curettage performed. Outcome was recovered with sequel. Nasal Swab COVID tested negative post vaccination on 18Feb2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The limited information provided precludes a full clinical assessment of the case. Considering the product-event temporal relationship, a causal association between the reported &#39;miscarried&#39; and the administration of bnt162b2 cannot be completely excluded. Case will be reassessed once with additional information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

After both shots I felt a great hormonal shift and got my period two days after. It was not due either time. I also ovulated heavily between both shots. Totally unusual for me. My cycle is now totally messed up.   *First Shot: Felt hormonal and got my period two days after (it was not due for a couple of weeks and I&#39;m usually pretty regular). *Just days after my period ended I ovulated heavily for days. Also very unusual and off schedule.  *Second Shot only two and a half weeks after the first shot and sure enough two days later I am having a heavy period again.

                                                I was about 4.5 weeks pregnant with the first dose of the vaccine; and 7.5 weeks with the second dose.  After the first dose, my hcg beta hormone level wasn&#39;t rising as fast as it should (ie. it wasn&#39;t doubling to tripling every 2 days) so I had to continue to get blood drawn to monitor it.  Then it had one big rise after 1.5 weeks; but soon after, I started spotting lightly daily.  After about a week of daily light spotting, I started heavily bleeding (like a menstrual period) on 3/25 (one day before my second dose).  I went for a sonogram and it was confirmed that the fetus had no heartbeat. We waited a few days after the second does to redo the sonogram but the bleeding had continued and the second sonogram showed no fetus-- meaning I had a miscarriage where the fetus was naturally eliminated through the bleeding.  I am being followed on a weekly basis for blood draws by my obgyn office to ensure that my hcg hormone level falls to 0.

My cycle was supposed to start 3/31 and I still haven?t had it as of 4/8 today. I have taken 4 pregnancy tests that are negative. This is very unusual for me. My only other side effects were sore arm, metallic taste and canker sores for three days after my first dose and the same only about 12-18 hours after my second. I want to know why my period disappeared, should women have smaller doses? How many ovulating women took part in these studies?

The patient medical history included five weeks postpartum; concomitant medications were not reported. On 19Mar2021 the patient experienced bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery that was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. These events required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and were described as follows: patient was five weeks postpartum and was exclusively breastfeeding the newborn. Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

                                                After receiving the second injection in my left arm on Thursday (4/1/21) afternoon, I noticed painful swelling had developed in my (L) armpit lymph node on Friday (4/2/21). Naproxen sodium taken orally (1-2x/day) &amp; CBD oil lightly applied to area (2-3x/day) helped to lessen pain. Swelling began to dissipate daily &amp; was undetectable by Sunday. On either Sunday (4/4/21) or Monday (4/5/21), I noticed some slight menstrual breakthrough bleeding. It was not the correct time in my cycle for menstruation and spotting is highly irregular - I have never experienced this. At first, I thought this was completely random &amp; unattributed to receiving the vaccine but saw on social media that many other women had experienced these effects after their shot. They also spoke of increased pain and heavy bleeding. As I haven&#39;t yet had my period again, I cannot comment on my experience at this time, but I am still experiencing the light breakthrough bleeding. I also noticed some slight fatigue through Monday evening (4/5/21).

                                                On the day of the vaccine, I started my period early.  The flow appears to be normal however, the day after I got the vaccine I had some of the worst cramps I have ever gotten in my life. I have only had very mild cramps, if any, over the last year or more. And I only remember more serve cramps once or twice over the last 4&#43; years. They were so bad I had to stop what I was doing, go home take 1000mg of tylenol and lay down. The pain only started to subside about 1 hr after I tool the tylenol and had a heat pack on my abdomen. The pain started to come back 2 hrs after I took the tylenol. I eventually feel asleep. I appear to be much better this morning but can still feel some tension in my abdomen. Have not taken any meds.  My period does vary some. Over the last 9 months (not including the one that just recently started) I average 25.44 days in between. Going back 9 months , time in between in days: 27, 25, 22, 24, 24, 28, 23, 30, 26. This last one that started the day I got the vaccine was only 19 days from the last one.

                                                Heavy menstrual bleeding lasting one day. Of note, patient has had most recent Mirena IUD inserted in spring of 2020 and has not had a menstrual period at all with IUD inserted prior to this. IUD placement was confirmed by patient after episode. In addition, patient experienced a similar episode of vaginal bleeding several days after first Pfizer dose three weeks prior. Timing of effect coupled with patient&#39;s typical lack of menstrual periods is highly suggestive of vaccine correlation.

                                                The issue is continued abnormal mensuration.  I had my usual mensuration, 5 days prior to vaccination, Monday, March 29, through Friday, April 2.  My period had completed by the morning of April 3.  I had my first vaccine shot at approximately 10:30am April 3, 2021.  On Monday, April 5, I began slightly menstruating mid-afternoon, increasing into the day and evening, continuing through the day Wednesday, April 7.  Approximately 1-2 tablespoons per 12-hour period (I use a mensural cup, and as a result can track the same).  Period was gone Thursday, April 8 and thereafter, until Monday April 12.  On Monday, April 12, once again began menstruating in the evening, continued through Tuesday, April 13, and into today, April 14, 2021.  Yesterday and today, it is enough that a mensural cup is necessary.  The April 5 through April 7, and April 12 through today, April 14 (and possibly beyond) is abnormal mensuration for my cycle.  My mensuration occurs for approximately 5 days and full cycle length is typically 21-25 days.  I do not have break through bleeding between mensuration.  I am not on hormonal birth control and have not been for approximately 2.5 years.  Mensuration has been the same cycle as noted above during that 2.5 year period (with one exception when the cycle was 40 days, but still no breakthrough bleeding).

                                                I am hearing reports of women experiencing their menstrual cycles being effected and I received the vaccine on day 5 of my cycle.  I was spotting on day 6, which may have been normal, but on day 9 I believe I ovulated  (5-7 days early for me) and have been spotting since then (very abnormal for me).  I have not yet started my period to say that it has been effected, but I am very aware of my body, so I thought I would report so that if someone wants to watch the effects of someone who believes the vaccine will cause my period to start early and may possibly be heavier as others have reported I am happy to share my experiences.

                                                Extreme menstrual-type cramping but no period (period was due that weekend) after vaccination. Cycle stalled for 22 days and I continued to have some PMS symptoms (migraine). The vaccine caused some sort of immune response that stopped my period that month. I have not had a cycle interruption like that since my 20s. I do have PCOS, but PCOS cycle interruptions usually don&#39;t have normal PMS symptoms and then suddenly stop. I took two pregnancy tests during that time a week apart and both were negative.

I was vaccinated Monday afternoon and by Tuesday night I started bleeding.  To put it into perspective I generally use 1 panty liner a day of the usually 2 maybe 2 days I lightly spot.  But I have been using 6 or so panty liners a day since then and it&#39;s Thursday night.  So this is highly irregular for my regularity.   I aldo expelled blood clots which hasn&#39;t happened since I had the IUD placed.  I thought it should be reported.

I have experienced 1 clogged duct at a time in the past, but this was at least 4 separate clogs that reached across my breast in a band. This is the worst breast duct clog I have ever experienced and caused a significant temporary decrease in my milk production! Please encourage nursing parents to get their vaccines in their thighs! - On 4/18 I notice itching on my back and breast. My husband checked and took pictures and I had vesicles/ blisters. I saw my doctor for a telemedicine visit on 4/19 and was started on high dose acyclovir for herpes zoster/ shingles.  - I have had shingles in the past and this is a much more severe outbreak!

My period is very regular since I&#39;m on birth control, but my period started a couple days early after getting the vaccine. It started about 6 days after my vaccine.

My menstrual cycles are entirely controlled via estradiol patches (changed 2 times a week) and a Mirena intrauterine device. Approximately 19 hours post-vaccine, I began off-cycle, irregular bleeding from my vagina. The bleeding was light (did not fill a tampon) and lasted approximately 24 hours. I experienced NO other symptoms that I typically experience with withdrawal bleeding (e.g., cramping, lower back pain, headache).  This off-cycle menstrual bleeding was in addition to chills, fever (101.0ºF), severe headache, fatigue, and generalized body aches that I experienced beginning 4 hours post-vaccine and lasted through hour 47 post-vaccine.

I got my vaccine on April 7th, and my previous period ended April 3rd.   Even worse than that is the headaches. I have started to get headaches that come and go throughout the day about two days after the vaccine. They are mood changing in their pain and intensity. Right and front spots of the head. Radiating little globes of pain. It hasn&#39;t stopped and I actually haven&#39;t got my second vaccine due to this, as I heard side effects are worse with the second dose. I can&#39;t have these headaches be worse. I don&#39;t know when they will happen, it occurs several times a day, and lasts anywhere from 30 min to several hours.

                                                Exceptionally heavy period, very unusual for me... both in terms of amount of blood and solid matter passed. Event remains in effect... I never have more than a single day of heavy flow and I&#39;m several days in, still soaking pad after pad. I hope that researchers start to take some of the period-related changes occurring in women post-vaccine seriously, as I&#39;d like to know what&#39;s going on.  I have not yet alerted the healthcare provider listed, but I will be doing so within a few days if this volume doesn&#39;t decrease and will let her know regardless the next time I have a well-visit or otherwise touch base.

I was scheduled to have it on May 6/7 and I still haven&#39;t gotten it. 2 years ago after my second child, I had a tubal litigation. A few months ago my husband also had a vasectomy so there is no way I am pregnant. Also on November 1, 2020, I tested positive for COVID-19. During this time I was late a few days for my period. I am about 7 days late and I do not have any spotting or cramping.

I have never been one to get horrible cramps and when I do they are not bad and come and go, but my last two cycles, my cramps lasted about 4 days when it usually only about the first and second day of my cycle.  Something is definitely not right and this all started after my first shot. I refuse to get the second as I?m afraid it?s effecting woman?s reproductive system.  I am not the only one out of my group of vaccinated friends to have this happen to after being inoculated.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 09Apr2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7533; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) (38-year-old) at first dose, single in upper arm left; on 30Apr2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) (38-year-old) at second dose, single in upper arm left for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications (other products) were reported as no. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on the same day, no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient&#39;s mother told her to get the vaccine. The patient experienced her normal menstrual cycle, two days before her first dose of vaccine, and bleeding has not stopped, and continued after second vaccine on 07Apr2021. She had 4 or 5 days where the bleeding was light last week, but then on Sunday, it came back with a vengeance. Her normal menstrual cycle was usually 3 light days and her periods were not like she is experiencing now. She had had moderate to heavy bleeding for 3 weeks until 17Apr2021, the next week it was lighter, and than the bleeding got heavier again on 24Apr2021. No family medical history related to the event. No investigation assessment. No emergency room and physician office visit. No relevant test. The outcome of the event was not resolved.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I also still have a sore right arm, it is also weak and does not have full range if motion. I had no issues with the first shot in my left arm. It was only after the second shot that was in my right arm.

                                                Initial side effects were as expected. Sore arm and feeling like I had a mild flu the next day. Very sore mid back pain, headache, chills and a fever of 101.   I am now 6 days late for my period ( neg pregnancy test). This never happens. I am like clockwork. I had not received any warning about this side effect but I came across a Reddit forum where other women were reporting menstrual problems after the vaccine also. This needs to be listed as a side effect. And it needs to be studied further in case it impacts fertility.

A 39-year-old female nurse reported that she received first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number EL0142), into the left arm on 28Dec2020 at 07:30 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis and allergies to Keflex ASA. Concomitant drugs were none. At the time of vaccination the patient was pregnant, her last menstrual date was on 20Nov2020, gestational period 6. The patient reported that on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 PM she had miscarriage 11 days post vaccine. The patient was seen at Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. At the time of reporting the patient was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded for reported miscarriage.  However, information is limited, and miscarriage is multifactorial event.  In the general population, the estimated background risk of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15% to 20%. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I found out I was pregnant on the 8th. I had  a normal ultrasound and a heartbeat at the end of January (the 29th) and February 8, there was no heartbeat anymore. I miscarried.  This was my fifth pregnancy. I had one other  miscarriage. I had a pregnancy where I had twins and one of the twins miscarried. So I have miscarried three babies. The expected date of delivery for this pregnancy was September 13, 2021.

I didn&#39;t see much of it so I left but it kept on going for the next couple of days then on the following Sunday I ended up going to the urgent care &amp; they sent me to the Emergency room from there. On march 1st I had a miscarriage I was 6 weeks pregnant, There was some questions when I found out I was pregnant to see if I was going to have some issues or not.

This 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route in the right arm, on 25Feb2021 at 17:30 (at the age of 39-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route in the right arm, on 19Mar2021 at 17:30 (at the age of 39-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination and the last menstrual date was 02Sep2020. Gestational period 5 weeks and delivery date 19Nov2021. Relevant medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis. Past drug history included allergy to amoxicillin and omeprazole. Relevant concomitant medications included ascorbic acid, betacarotene, calcium sulfate, colecalciferol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous fumarate, folic acid, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, thiamine mononitrate, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRENATAL VITAMINS). No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed. On 21Mar2021 (at 14:00), the patient had miscarriage. The event required physician office visit. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. She was recovering from the event.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pending the limited information on clinical course, the company does not attribute the event miscarriage to BNT162B2. The detailed document of pregnancy, relevant risk factors, status of Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis are missing for a medically meaningful assessment.

However the reason this is odd for me was the first day of my last period was on 4/1/21, nine days prior to my 2nd COVID vaccine. As a 39 year old whose had periods since I was 14, I&#39;ve NEVER had this happen. I have had irregular periods in the past, but it&#39;s always been late, never back to back like this was. It seems odd to me that a vaccine would have this effect, but I wanted to report it because it was very bizarre for me and the only thing that was different was the vaccine.

                                                One week after my first vaccine (and 9 days prior to my regular period), I started spotting bright red blood. I spotted  until my period started. Heaviness was less than a period but more than I think a pantyliner could have handled. Additionally, I had excruciating cramps the day my period did start. I realize the increased pain may have been psychological, but the bleeding was not. I am 39 and I have NEVER had anything like the bleeding I had after my vaccine.

Then by the time I got home my entire left side was numb and tingly - myleft eye was blurry, my left jaw felt funny, my left hip and leg were numb making it hard to walk and balance. This went away by the next morning (thank goodness).   But I still had a Very sore Arm and some tingling in that arm.   I also had intense pain and swelling in my arm pit starting day 3 thru 6 (now),  this is pretty serious swelling  in that area - my left arm pit, shoulder, even my left breast is swollen and very tender to move or touch.  I have also gotten random chills  a couple times a day that last for an hour or so, and I have had random nausea (about once or twice a day for an hour or two).  Finally overall fatigue for the past 6 days.

                                                I received the vaccine on Sunday, May 2, 2021 around 12 noon. On Monday, May 3, 2021 around 6pm, I started to get horrendous and unusual menstrual cramping and heavy bleeding. I hoped the cramping would stop but it continued to the point that I felt I may have to go to urgent care. I took 4 ibuprofen and did no feel any relief until almost 10pm. I was extremely concerned about the cramping and heavy bleeding, both of which are unusual for me. I woke up on Tuesday, May 4, 2021, and the cramping has subsided but the heavy bleeding continues.

                                                Both times the vaccine seemed to cause heavy menstrual bleeding which is completely abnormal for me. This time around, after the second dose, I started getting bad cramps the night I received the vaccine and when I went to the bathroom several small blood clots came out. My period was supposed to start on May 5th so it started earlier and I?m a 28 day cycle kind of person.  I was awakened by worse cramps around 5am the morning after on 5/4/21. I had heavy bleeding and some more blood clots. I am not a heavy bleeder normally and I also rarely ever get cramps. This seems to be directly related to receiving the vaccine. I have had regular periods my whole life and haven?t had cramps and heavy bleeding since I was a early adulthood. In addition to the menstrual symptoms I had a pretty bad headache, nausea and significant fatigue following both vaccinations. I also had a slight fever although my body temperature runs lower than average so my fever was not alarmingly high, just higher than usual for me.

I contacted my doctor via the online message system and advised her of the spotting. She instructed me to rest and take fluids.  - Second adverse event on 09/13/21 (17 weeks, 3 days pregnant)- I woke up with a swollen right eye, which was crusted shut with mucus. My first thought was that it was either debris in my eye or pink eye. I made an appointment with the eye doctor and he said that it&#39;s likely a stye forming and to use a warm compress.  - Third adverse event on 09/16/21 (17 weeks, 6 days pregnant) - I tried using the bathroom to pass a stool and was finding myself a bit constipated (which hasn&#39;t been uncommon in this pregnancy). I experienced enough bleeding to have blood in the toilet and continuous blood while wiping. I went immediately to the ER for treatment.

A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of  BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 10Apr2021 at 15:30 (at the age of 39-years-old)  as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. The patient had not received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Historical vaccinations included the first dose of  bnt162b2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown) on 20Mar2021 at 15:45 (at the age of 39 years old) as a single dose in the right arm. The patient previously took celecoxib (CELEXA) and experienced drug hypersensitivity and morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was 16Feb2021. She reported that she became pregnant while taking bnt162b2.  The patient was due to deliver on 23Nov2021.

The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded.

                                                New menstruation patterns. Specifically, very heavy menstruation (large glob of blood) that soaked through a tampon in an hour (not typical for me) and soaked my pants without cramping. What came out looked like a large blood clot (similar to a miscarriage). Later, my period suddenly stopped which is also highly unusual. After looking at medical journals and information reported from doctors, I am not the only female with post-menstruation issues after the COVID vaccine.

I was close to my due date so I thought nothing of it. This shot, I got my period a week early and a few days before that, I had some severe and acute pain around my clitoris and some light brown/tan/yellow discharge. I&#39;d never had anything like it in my life.

                                                I had submitted my initial side effects after my first shot but just to put all of it this in one place I am going to include them again along with the latter. One hour after getting my 1st vaccine shot (03/12/21) I began to experience hot flashes, which I had never before experienced. They lasted for 10 days. They began hourly and started tapering off as the days went on. I keep track of my cycle and received the vaccine the day before I was supposed to ovulate. I am 39 years old, healthy, and have always had a regular period. I should have gotten my period 2 weeks after (around 3/26/21). It did not come until 04/14/21. It was much heavier, more painful and lasted a little longer than what I am typically used to. I figured it was just a month and it would get back on schedule. It is now  May 22nd and once again my period is not here. I had a 26-27 day cycle prior to the vaccine so this is highly abnormal for me and concerning since there is no information as to how long this could go on for. I am not under any kind of unusual stress or going through any life changes. It has to be associated with my first shot. It&#39;s the only thing that is a variable in this time frame.

Concomitant medications included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA) taken to prevent bleeding; buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR); omeprazole; cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (FLEXERIL); and naproxen, start and stop dates were not reported. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and experienced allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. On 12Feb2021, the patient experienced immediate (very much unwanted) menstruation despite Depo-Provera to prevent bleeding. This was following both the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccine. No treatment was given for the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

With this period it was heavy days 1-8, lighter on days 9-14, and now on Day 15 it&#39;s started over with horrific cramps. The longest periods I&#39;ve ever had before were for 8 days as a teenager. This is far outside of anything I&#39;ve ever experienced before. Also I previously submitted a record of me getting diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, so I continue to experience terrible side effects of this vaccine.

                                                On 1/21/21, approximately 59 hours after I received the Pfizer\BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine #2 without any immediate adverse events, I woke up in the middle of the night with subjective fevers, sweats, chills,  generalized weakness with dizziness and feeling faint, nausea, diarrhea, and severe pelvic/lower abdominal pain (though I was also in the process of starting my menstrual cycle).  I also vaguely noticed an erythematous rash on my chest and abdomen at that time.  I took a dose of ondansetron for nausea and acetaminophen for pain.  Later that morning (1/21/21), I continued to have generalized weakness, subjective fevers and chills, extreme fatigue, nausea, and a morbilliform-type rash most prominently on my torso (chest, abdomen, back) and some areas of my upper arms and thighs, as well as bright red and hyperemic palms and soles that had a prickly sensation throughout.  I no longer had abdominal pain, but did have significant polyarthritis with difficulty moving my joints without pain.  This included my knees, elbows, ankles, wrists, as well as fingers/hands especially.  My fingers and toes felt very swollen and I had trouble putting my normal enclosed shoes on.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol during this time for symptom control.  Later I added diphenhydramine, loratadine, and famotidine.  These symptoms waxed and waned in intensity for at least 8 days with continued spread of rash, extreme fatigue, ongoing joint pain, and subjective fevers.  The only measured fever was on 1/23/21 when I had access to a thermometer - my oral temperature was 100.7F if I recall correctly.  I never had any respiratory symptoms. On 1/29/21 I saw Hospital Allergist Dr in order to participate in a research study on adverse vaccine reactions; I did not have a formally documented medical appointment with her for my medical records.  By that time, my energy level was slowly improving and I was able to return to work.  My arthritis symptoms had nearly fully resolved, however, my rash had gone from not particularly bothersome to very diffusely pruritic.  I began to take cetirizine for symptoms instead of loratidine. In addition, the skin along my L palm began to slough and peel off, most notably in the webspaces between my thumb and index finger bilaterally and the tip of my L thumb and L ring finger.  These areas of my palm had the most notable peeling and sloughing around 2/2/21 and by 2/7/21 my R palm was also peeling in similar fashion to the L.  On 2/11/21, I noticed that the skin along my L sole, particularly between all five digits had begun to peel quite markedly; large connected pieces of skin were sloughing off.  The sloughing on the L foot spread from between the toes and the ball of the foot to the arch and then the heel over several days.  On 2/14/21, the R foot/sole began having the same findings, with large amounts of sloughing first between the toes and then extending to the ball of the foot, arch, and ultimately the heel.  Some sort of foot/sole peeling continued through the final week of February 2021 and into early March.

                                                Roughly 16 hours after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination I began experiencing abdominal cramping that I would normally associate with menstrual like cramping. The reason I found this to be abnormal is that I underwent an ablation procedure more than seven years ago and have rarely if ever experienced abdominal cramping since that time. Approximately two weeks after the injection I experienced what I could consider an abnormal menstrual cycle with bleeding that lasted four to five days. I found this to be strange considering I&#39;ve not experienced any such menstrual cycle since undergoing the ablation more than seven years ago. Since the ablation procedure I could count the number of times, on one hand, when I&#39;ve experienced any type of bleeding and those instances have produced such an insignificant amount of blood that I could not justify even wearing a tampon. In those handful of situations I spotted for 2-4 hours maximum. Fast forward two more weeks and here I am having a menstrual cycle and bleeding enough to wear a tampon.

                                                Second Vaccine Location: Pharmacy. On 6/2/21 (day after 2nd dose) I vomited repeatedly throughout the day, a total of 4 times between 9am and 5pm and was unable to keep any water or Tylenol down at all. I had a strong headache the entire day, which also brought with mental fatigue and overwhelm - I couldn&#39;t even manage to watch tv I was so ill, it was hard to concentrate, think or even focus my eyes. Around 5pm, feeling severely dehydrated and realizing the urgent cares would be closing soon I scheduled a telehealth dr. appt. with assistance. (I couldn&#39;t sit up or focus long before being overcome with nausea, and it was very hard to think.)The telehealth dr. prescribed me anti nausea medicine - Ondansetron, orally disintegrating tablet, 4mg. Told me to attempt drinking 1tsp water every 10 min. after having the medicine. After taking this medicine and also a dissolving form of tylenol you could put on your tongue, and waiting another hour I was able to begin taking sips of water and sit up. I was able to drink more water over the next few hours and finally some cold plain cereal. I thought I was finally in the clear, however I was surprised that I continued to feel nauseous the next two days and continued to need to take the medicine prescribed (from 6/2 - 6/4). My stomach was so upset from nausea and also I had cramps from beginning my menstrual cycle, but I continued to have stomach aches for the following two days (6/2-6/5). I wondered if it was a side effect from the vaccine or the anti nausea medicine. I also experienced constipation 6/2-6/12, (up to the day of writing this) something I never have an issue with. While I could say it might be related to the medicine, I don&#39;t understand why it would continue so long. It has improved somewhat gradually. What was most surprising to me after all of this is I then began to experience having a stutter when speaking, approximately once a day every day since returning to work through June 8th. (6/4 - 6/8). While this might seem minor, I have not ever experienced this in my life, so four times in four days is markedly unusual.

I am not sure if I will continue to bleed if my cycle comes on again?.now I am currently 7 days late for it to start.

This non-pregnant 39-year-old female patient received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME; lot number EN6206) via an unspecified route of administration on 04May2021 (at the age of 39-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and had not received any other vaccines in the four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that she had &#34;struck periods&#34; for long duration &#34;(15)&#34; and gap between monthly periods had reduced from 25 days to 10 days. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. No treatment was received for the events.

Ovulated 10 days later than normal in next cycle.   I had been keeping track because we were trying to get pregnant. My periods are always very regular. I became pregnant with EDD 10/31/21 and suffered miscarriage on 3/21/21. Genetic screening from fetal tissue showed digynic triploidy. I do not necessarily think vaccine caused miscarriage however I am just stating what happened with my cycle immediately prior to getting pregnant.
