                                                About an hour after receiving my first dose I had a sore arm but just a normal amount for any vaccine. The next morning I woke up and felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I had an immobilizing migraine, full body aches, I could hardly eat and get out of bed, I also had a mild fever and mild cough. That only lasted about a day and a half.  I didn?t find it necessary to seek medical attention and just took some ibuprofen to help ease symptoms. After both doses I noticed some light spotting the two days after.  Also I did just have a baby in November but I am not breastfeeding. I work in a Pharmacy and they got me the vaccine before I returned from maternity leave.

                                                I ended up starting my period April 20, 2020 (same day I got the vaccine) and it was the heaviest cycle I&#39;ve had in years. I went through several tampons in a day for about a week til my period abruptly stopped on April 26, 2020.  It started about 2 hours after the vaccination. I usually don&#39;t cramp but I was having problems sleeping because of how bad it got. I was also more bloated than my usual cycles. I dealt with extreme fatigue, I slept a lot that week and I did the bare minimum that week at work (which is unusual for me).  I also don&#39;t usually have mood swings but I felt like my hormones were a bit intense to the point I kept snapping at people even though I like to think of myself as level-headed.

                                                My last period started Tuesday Feb 2nd and did not stop until 14 days later, more than double my usual menstrual cycle. It seemed pretty normal and painless, but then on 8th day I was surprised to find myself still bleeding . It was a darker color around then, but then became brighter and I noticed myself passing clots when I went to the restroom that were loose, but about the size of a quarter or half dollar. I did not bleed through any menstrual pads, but the return of bright red after it being a darker red that im used to at the end of a period had me concerned. I was in slight discomfort around my uterus/bowels and I couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s my body recovering from the vaccine, or something else.  I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 2/11/21 (Pfizer) and stayed home from work as I had a fever/headache/chills (this was not unexpected to me, my coworkers had the same symptoms).  Family medical history: grandmother (dad&#39;s mom) in remission from stage 4 uterine cancer about 5 years ago. Mom had endometriosis at 45 and had a hysterectomy.

Unsure if this is related to vaccination at all but patient has been very regular every other cycle and that is the only change this month so wanted to report in case their are any other similar reports.

I&#39;ve never taken any feminine birth control and have always had a very, very regular and reliable period. But this go around I was experience heavy bleeding and cramps right away rather than a few days in. Even now after five days, I my period would normally be tapering off and the blood would be changing to light pink in color. Yet, I&#39;m still experiencing bright red blood.

                                                Within 7 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started what I thought was my second period of the month. I had just finished a period 12 days earlier. I am usually 35 - 42 days between periods so this was VERY unusual for me. I had my normal period pre-vaccine Jan 4 - 9 then 7 hours after the vaccine started bleeding again from the 21-25 of January. Then again on Feb 4 - 9. I got my second vaccine while bleeding. Then again started to bleed on Feb 21 - 25. I had a doctors appointment at the end of February. I got an annual gyno exam as well as a ton of bloodwork was taken to check everything out. I was told to continue to monitor the bleeding and if it didn&#39;t stop we would do a pelvic ultrasound. Well, it didn&#39;t stop so we did and it came back normal. I had a mostly normal March with light bleeding. I thought perhaps it was getting better but no. I have had two periods in April. In fact still bleeding on round two and this is my 6th day bleeding. Periods or irregular bleeding was April 12-17 and then again on April 24 - 29 (still happening and it&#39;s the 29th). This is very scary to me as no doctors can help.

Approximately 36-48 hours after the fever began, my period started, and I had severe cramps, blood clots, and bleeding that were notably abnormal for me. I am on birth control and have very minor, if any, withdrawal bleeding.

I also began shedding from my vagina small clumps of skin, maybe the size of a pea. I started my period about a week later and experienced much heavier flow than normal in a much shorter period of time.  My second dose was received on 01/20/21 at 10am at the same facility. The day after I began similar feelings of cramping and experienced very heavy, opaque white discharge from my vagina with a couple of pea sized clumps of what looked like my vaginal wall the day or two after, but then none at all. I continued to see this odd discharge until today (01/31/21).  Neither experience was at all painful, but it was very alarming.

                                                I am unsure if this is related but thought I should report it because it was highly unusual, but: My menstrual cycle began at around 12:30am on 03-19-2021. There was some bad cramping as is usual for me in the first 24 hours. I was able to function normally enough until about 9P (on 03-19-2021),  at which time I began experiencing debilitating cramps and muscle spasms that made it difficult to walk or move. I felt lightheaded and like I was going to pass out (which has never happened related to my period before). I got in bed and this persisted until moving at all brought me to tears. I have not been in this much pain from cramps and muscle spasms in over a decade.  And never this prolonged and intense. I was unable to sleep until about 4:30am, managed to sleep for a few hours, had to see, and now I&#39;m here filling this out before I attempt to go back to sleep.  My pain at the moment is high, but similar to what a normal &#34;first day of cycle and it&#39;s bad&#34; day would be for me.  Before this, though, was 8 hours straight of some of the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life.  I felt it important for me to make a formal report in the event that adverse effects surrounding menstruation were common for others and in case this does not subside. I am thinking it will like the initial muscle aches after receiving the shot.

                                                Early miscarriage; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health care professional (Patient). A 30-year-old female patient (pregnant, last menstrual date 19Jan2021, Delivery date: 26Oct2021, Gestational period 4 weeks) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9269), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 19Feb2021 at 15:15 at the age of 30 years old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history included rheumatoid arthritis. There were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included prenatal vitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient received other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced early miscarriage on 01Mar2021. No treatment was received in response to the adverse event. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, patient was not tested for COVID-19. The patient was recovering from the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pending the limited information on clinical course, the company does not attribute the event early miscarriage to BNT162B2. The detailed document of pregnancy, relevant risk factors, status of rheumatoid arthritis are missing for a medically meaningful assessment.

                                                Vaginal bleeding/irregular bleeding; bloody noses; spotting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).  This  30-years-old female patient received at hospital bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1  administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as SINGLE DOSE, and dose 2 on 07Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) administered in Arm Left  as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination 30 years. Medical history included ongoing spotting (she has had her tubes tied in the past /She continued to have spotting even after the period was over). The patient got 1st dose on 17Feb2021 and developed Vaginal bleeding, bloody noses.  She said she was having a period every 2 weeks, and &#34;spotting&#34; every other day. The she got 2nd dose on 07Mar2021, and experienced nose is bleeding and vaginal bleeding again.Then it was added she completed both; and keeps having irregular bleeding. she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination 17Feb2021 at an unknown time in the left arm. On that day she noticed irregular bleeding, spotting. Mentioned she has had her tubes tied in the past and so she called her gynecologist who made an appointment for her. Then she got her regular period two weeks later to she cancelled that appointment. She continued to have spotting even after the period was over. She mentioned this to her gynecologist twice and he said to wait and see. She received the second dose 07Mar2021 at 16:50 PM in the left arm. She noticed today on 10Mar2021 she was having vaginal bleeding and spotting with bright red blood and also a nose bleed. Mentioned she also noticed blood with sex. She was concerned and plans to contact her HCP next because her brother had osteosarcoma at 16 years old  and she has a cousin who had thrombocytopenia. Seriousness criteria provided -Other medically important conditions. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it is unlikely  that the reported &#34;vaginal bleeding, spotting with bright red blood and nose bleed&#34; were due to bnt162b2.  These are probably intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed of additional information is received.

                                                I had my first dose of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine on the 5th of April, 2021 at 1pm. I had sore arm and was fatigued which was expected. However, the day I had my vaccine was also the day my menstrual cycle started and just to assure myself I informed the pharmacist and asked if that was okay and they said it shouldn?t be a concern.   I was doing fine until toward the end of day 3. I was expecting my period to stop as it always does on 3rd day  but I started bleeding heavier that day there after. It didn?t worry me much until I started discharging huge blood clots  as big as an apple 2 times every after 30 mins from that moment.   I rushed to the ER later that night(still bleeding heavily with blood clots every now and then) but I was not admitted since my vitals and the blood counts were normal at that moment.   I went back home  and hoped the bleeding would stop but again with on pain or fever what so ever I kept bleeding all day. This is my 5th day of bleeding. Then on Sunday morning, I still kept bleeding heavy and I was too weak that I went back to the ER again.   This time , (day 6) I got admitted because I have had lost a lot of blood and I needed blood transfusion. My HB dropped from 11.3 to 6.7 and it went further down to 5 something. I got 3 units of blood transfusion in the ER. They did ultrasound, CT scans(with and without contrast) and still couldn?t figure out the cause of the bleeding. My uterus showed no problems but my body was not even responding to Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. So the doctor proceeded with an angiogram and did an emergency uterine artery Embolization to stop the blood supply to the uterus. The bleeding stopped there after and I started regaining my vitals.  However, the cause of the bleeding still remains unknown.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (04Jan2021), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital.  Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome.  Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), famotidine (PEPCID), ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (CILIQUE) for birth control and multivitamin. It was stated that the patient got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. On 17Dec2020, she developed severe abdominal pain radiating to her upper and her middle back with pretty bad nausea, fatigue and headache. It was also mentioned that the patient had stomach cramps. These continued all the way until like Christmas. And then on the 19Dec2020, she actually got her menstrual cycle though she was not due to start that till that week. So, it came like almost two and a half weeks early (which was super weird as for her). The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX); famotidine and hyoscyamine for like stomach cramping. She also took that as well, acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). It was mentioned that the symptoms stopped on 26Dec2020 then she sinus infection right after in Dec 2020. Outcome of the event of sinus infection was unknown while the remaining events recovered on 26Dec2020. The patient stated that the she don&#39;t think that sinus infection was correlated at all but all other symptoms were happening right after the vaccine (reported as related).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event sinus infection is likely intercurrent and is unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                Extremely early menstrual cycle. My period ended 2/23 one week before I was vaccinated and started again 2 days after vaccination. My periods are regular (between 27-29 days) so this is very irregular and concerning. No other changes has occurred in my life to cause such a drastic cycle change. I am only on day 2 of my period but so far it looks like any other day two so I&#39;m assuming it will run the full 5 day course.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

I went to urgent care and was prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding to no avail. I then proceeded to go to urgent care again because the bleeding had not stopped. At my second Doctors visit, I had an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound done, and both of them came back completely normal. I have now scheduled an upcoming obgyn appointment, but cannot be seen until 03/09/2021.

                                                Beginning the day after my shot, I experienced engorging in my left breast. My breast was swollen, hard, and painful to touch. I?m currently breastfeeding my 7 month old, and I wasn?t able to get much milk out. I haven?t had an issue with engorgement since my baby was first born and my milk came in. Since this was unusual, I think it?s related to the vaccine. The engorging only lasted the day after my shot, and it went away that evening (lasted about 12 hours).

                                                I got the usual arm pain at injection site the night after getting the vaccine. 24 hours later, I had really bad diarrhea (possibly connected) but nothing else yet. 2 days after, i woke up with the normal fatigue, slight headache, and nausea from upset stomach. But what I did not expect was that 2nd night I got my period a week early and super heavy (I&#39;m on birth control and haven&#39;t had my period, except for some spotting, in years). I spoke to some friends and a few of them suprisingly also reported extra heavy menstrual cycles or feeling like they were PMSing around 48 hours after. I couldn&#39;t find much online except for a bunch of random people complaining about the same thing, and no study or source of significance to back it. I&#39;m wondering if this something they even looked out for? There seems to be a pretty strong correlation with certain people around my age just from asking around. And I don&#39;t think anyone who I spoke to even realized it could be connected until I mentioned it. It was just shocking and significant to me because I&#39;m on set pills that I didn&#39;t miss, with no menstrual cycle issues, and I haven&#39;t bled more than spotting in years until this. It lessened the next day, and lessened again today since that symptom started.

I had no other signs or symptoms of miscarriage or illness.  Pregnancy history - I do not have any other children yet.

I previously had 4 healthy pregnancies and 4 living children (now 5 pregnancies and 4 living children).  I conceived on 12/18/2020 the day after I received my 1st covid vaccine. I began spotting blood on 3/7/2021 and miscarried an approximately 7 week old embryo. I had a D &amp; C procedure to remove the baby that stopped growing weeks before ( I was 14 weeks and 1 day into my pregnancy before the miscarriage).Due date was sept 4th 2021.

                                                I received the vaccine and was unknowingly pregnant. My first shot was on 1/6/2021 and my second shot was on 1/27/2021. I conceived on  1/25/2021. I ended up miscarrying the child and when they sent it in for testing it had 2 abnormal chromosomes. One of which they said is very rare and they have no idea how or why the baby had this. I was told that the vaccine was supposed to be safe for pregnant people but with no family history of anything like this happening and no history of any children being born with mutations I believe this happened from the vaccine. Possibly caused by the spike in temperature I experienced after the second shot. I should have been due to deliver 10/2021.

Spotting is not a normal occurrence in my menstrual cycle.  April 28 was day 23 of my cycle.  My cycles are usually around 35-45 days long.  The spotting started out as brown/pink.  It was light for the first few days.   I have been spotting every day since getting the vaccine.  It has progressively gotten heavier and requires pads.   It is red and there is also  dark brown blood.  I have been bleeding for 8 days.  It is ongoing and has not stopped.

It may not be related to the vaccine at all, but given this is a new vaccine and not studied in pregnant women I thought it was best to report it.

                                                Miscarriage: LMP  11/17/20, diagnosis of MAB on 1/26/21. Chromosomal testing of the embryo determined cause of miscarriage to be trisomy 12.  Prior to this most recent miscarriage I had 3 previous miscarriages and 1 live birth (1 living child).  To be clear, I do not blame the vaccine for the miscarriage, the chromosomes of the embryo were determined before I got my first Covid vaccine.

After my miscarriage I was under heavy medication.

This increased to chills, a temp of 101f (baseline 97.8), and myalgias/fatigue so severe Going to the restroom felt like running a marathon (which I have done). I had to fully lay down and couldn?t carry my 15lb son. I also had marked breast tenderness greater on the side of the injection. My son seemed to have trouble staying latched (?due to tiredness from my direct warmth), and had increased fussiness.  I have never had more than a mild local injection reaction w tenderness with any other vaccine

Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

                                                7 days after my first Pfizer COVID vaccine, I developed mastitis. It began in the morning with mild generalized muscle and joint pain and progressed to moderate to severe joint pain, a fever of 102 degrees, and localized redness and swelling of the left breast over the course of 12 hours. Treatment with Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 14 days was initiated within 12 hours of onset. The systemic symptoms resolved within 24 hours of treatment onset and the breast redness and swelling resolved within 72 hours.   While I am aware that an infectious mastitis is likely unrelated to the vaccine, I opted to report this incident because I have breastfed 3 children and have never had mastitis prior to this event  and because of the limited information available on this vaccine in lactating women.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscularly on the left arm, on 07Jan2021 10:30, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer. Concomitant medication included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID). The patient previously took hydromorphone (DILAUDID) and metaxalone (SKELAXIN) and experienced allergies to both. The vaccine was given at the hospital. The patient stated that her menstrual cycle has been off and then it restarted with brown clotting old blood on 09Jan2021 (also reported as 24Jan2021); her period was not due for another 10 days. She added that her cycles have never been off, and she has never had issues with her menstrual cycles or any female problems. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit on 27Jan2021. Unspecified treatment was received for the adverse event. The outcome of the adverse event was unknown. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and have not been COVID tested post vaccination.

The patient medical history included five weeks postpartum; concomitant medications were not reported. On 19Mar2021 the patient experienced bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery that was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. These events required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and were described as follows: patient was five weeks postpartum and was exclusively breastfeeding the newborn. Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

A 39-year-old female nurse reported that she received first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number EL0142), into the left arm on 28Dec2020 at 07:30 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis and allergies to Keflex ASA. Concomitant drugs were none. At the time of vaccination the patient was pregnant, her last menstrual date was on 20Nov2020, gestational period 6. The patient reported that on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 PM she had miscarriage 11 days post vaccine. The patient was seen at Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. At the time of reporting the patient was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded for reported miscarriage.  However, information is limited, and miscarriage is multifactorial event.  In the general population, the estimated background risk of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15% to 20%. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This was my fifth pregnancy. I had one other  miscarriage. I had a pregnancy where I had twins and one of the twins miscarried. So I have miscarried three babies. The expected date of delivery for this pregnancy was September 13, 2021.

This 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route in the right arm, on 25Feb2021 at 17:30 (at the age of 39-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route in the right arm, on 19Mar2021 at 17:30 (at the age of 39-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination and the last menstrual date was 02Sep2020. Gestational period 5 weeks and delivery date 19Nov2021. Relevant medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis. Past drug history included allergy to amoxicillin and omeprazole.
