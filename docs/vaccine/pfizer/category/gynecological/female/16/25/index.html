Now still having trouble falling asleep but only a few hours past when she would normally fall asleep.  Her normal period ended on April 26th,  she received her second shot on May 1st her period came back again on May 6th unexpectedly. Instead of just blood flow it seems to be tissue??  in the mix as well and heavier than usual.

After receiving the COVID vaccine, pt experienced severe cramps and began her menstrual cycle with heavy flow. This is a manageable adverse reaction, but important to consider when administering COVID vaccines to female pts and how they might interfere with fertility, menstruation, and hormones.

This is NOT how I usually experience my period. Many people I&#39;ve spoken to have said that after receiving the Pfizer shot, their period was heavier and earlier than normal. This information should have been included in the warnings, as this seems to be an EXTREMELY common side effect to people who mensurate.

The bleeding was very clotted and seemed somewhat abnormal; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer. A 20-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 20 years). The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that after 3 years of not having her period, she suddenly started bleeding heavily and having menstrual cramps. The bleeding was very clotted and seemed somewhat abnormal. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab: negative on an unspecified date. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                started bleeding, period symptoms, and it has progressed much worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 21-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 29Mar2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included birth control. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA shot) taken for birth control. Within an hour of receiving, patient started bleeding, period symptoms at 04:00 PM on 29Mar2021, and it has progressed much worse. This makes patient question the integrity of her birth control, a depo shot once every 3 months. Patient visited doctor or other healthcare professional office for the event. No treatment received. It was unknown if patient had covid prior vaccination. No other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not test covid post vaccination. Outcome of the event was recovering.    Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications that the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 09Feb2021 08:30 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

Extreme muscle tightness in left calf. Ultrasound done on calf came back negative. Full brain/spinal cord scan done to detect demyelination of nerves - MRI came back normal. EMG done on left leg to check for peripheral nerve damage - EMG came back normal. Almost 8 weeks post 2nd dose and still experiencing muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms, specifically in legs through feet. Hands and feet &#34;fall asleep&#34;/go numb very frequently, even when the extremities are not restricted in any way. No medication or other treatment given for symptoms. Extremely heavy and painful menstrual cycle this month (1 month after 2nd vaccine, Apr2021), which is extremely abnormal for patient. Events were assessed as serious with criteria of Disabling/Incapacitating. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Three days after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began menstruating 5 days ahead of schedule. My period has been regular for years now so it was unusual for it to begin so early, it has also continued longer than usual. Typically my periods last 5 days at most, but this one is still continuing on day 8. Other than the unusual timing and long duration, there does not seem to be anything concerning about it but I felt I should report it incase this turns out to be a significant side effect of the vaccine.
