She was tested for active COVID-29 infection via nasal swab PCR and tested positive. Upon presentation labs were drawn and her platelet count was found to be 8 on 5/15. Repeat labs were drawn that day to confirm low platelet count and confirmed diagnosis and thrombocytopenia secondary to an immune reaction to the vaccine was suspected. She was admitted and was started on tranexamic acid, medroxyprogesterone, dexamethasone and IV immunoglobulin (Ig) to help treat low platelet count and vaginal bleeding. As of writing, she is still admitted and her most recent platelet count on 5/17 was 16.

After that period ended, she got her period again on June 7th with incredibly heavy bleeding and painful cramping (the cramping was so bad it had her up all night June 8th).  The second period is a total surprise given the she is taking her birth control regularly.  Also the heavy bleeding and extreme cramping is not normal for her on her birth control.

About 30 minutes to an hour later I started having mild stomach cramps similar to menstrual cramps. I later found out I had menstrual bleeding (about 2:30 PM). This was unnatural for me because I have an IUD and have had it for 9 months, so I haven&#39;t been getting PMS like cramps or my cycle for the past few months.

Approximately 3-4 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she started a very heavy menstrual period and is still experiencing it. It is precisely the type of menstrual bleeding that resulted in the Nexplanon being prescribed.

When I came back to my room around 12 pm I noticed I had started my period which is highly unlikely it would happen on its own as I?ve had my iud for over a year and it has completely stopped my period until the day I received my vaccine.

What is unusual about it is that, according to my birth control pill schedule, I was not expecting to get my period until at least six days later. This may or may not have been a direct effect of the vaccine, but I though that I should report it just in case.

Starting yesterday, I noticed I wasn&#39;t feeling well and today I have some menstrual bleeding. I am on continuous birth control and have not had spotting in a very long time. I have not missed a pill to cause this. I saw the vaccine has caused changes in menstrual cycles so I think this is likely what happened. I wanted to report it as I am on continuous norethindrone and still have had a change in my cycle-or lack thereof. I am also experiencing light menstrual cramps. I&#39;m hoping it won&#39;t be anything more than spotting.

A 19-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 19 years of age), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included contraception from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LARIN FE) taken for contraception, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that the patient received her first dose of Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine 09Mar2021. She mentioned that almost immediately afterward she had breakthrough bleeding and now she has a &#34;full blown period&#34; even though she was on the pill.  She wanted to know whether this has been reported, and if she should be concerned. She added that she got the Covid vaccine on Tuesday 9Mar2021, and since then she has been having a lot of menstrual spotting, she was not supposed to get her period for another week or two. This started almost immediately after she got the vaccine about an hour or two after on the same day. She was unsure if this could be a side effect of the vaccine. Stated it had progressively gotten worse and was now a full blown period. Stated she does not typically have any breakthrough bleeding. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                My period was so much heavier than normal and so much more painful. I was unable to go to school or do any work. This is NOT how I usually experience my period. Many people I&#39;ve spoken to have said that after receiving the Pfizer shot, their period was heavier and earlier than normal. This information should have been included in the warnings, as this seems to be an EXTREMELY common side effect to people who mensurate. Please start including female-specific health outcomes in your research.

I then starting feeling severe cramping like menstrual cramps so I used a heating pad and fell back asleep. I woke up later the same day (4/24) and my period had started a few days earlier than expected. My last few cycles have started at the same time. My main concern were the severe cramps I had this morning as I have not had anything that serious before.

                                                My Dysmenorrhea was a huge issue for me until I started taking Norethindrone, which fixed the issue.  However when I got the Covid vaccine my Dysmenorrhea returned. I vomited and had severe cramping. My cramping used to be two days. On Norethindrone I had no cramps or vomiting, I didn&#39;t even have a flow during my menstrual cycle anymore. After the vaccine, I vomited, had cramps for 4 or 5 days, (so worse than before). I have continued to have spotty breakthrough  bleeding on and off for three weeks, which is much longer than it has ever been.  I&#39;m concerned about what will happen with the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                I had a sore arm the first day after the shot. Two days after I woke up from my sleep with very bad chills and a 102 fever at 11:30 pm. After two hours, the chills stopped but my fever was still at 102. I went back to sleep at 3:00 am and woke up without a fever but still felt very tired and groggy for the next two days. Also, am not sure if it is related, but I am usually very regular on my menstrual cycle, but was 20 days late after getting the first vaccine. I know this because I track my menstrual cycle. Also, when my period did finally come, it was the most painful period that I have had in a while. The cramping was very painful and I bled very heavily.  Although, I got my second shot on the 27th of May and had no symptoms. I also, to my knowledge, did not have covid prior to getting either shot.

Pain was worse every time I inhaled. My breast on the right side swelled up and became red splotchy and hot. Had fever symptoms for 2 to 3 days afterwards. The excruciating pain in my chest and rib cage subsided within 6 to 8 hours. However the swelling in my right breast and redness did not subside for about three days.

                                                After first shot I just had soreness in my arm.  Before my second shot on 5/13 I had gotten my period 5/3. It had been tappering off by the time I had my second covid shot. When I had received my second vaccination I had zero symptoms except for a sore arm. Thought it would be the same as the first vaccine. Except that I had had my period for over a month now and my suspicions are due to the vaccine. I had to call my OBGYN about it and they also didn&#39;t know what to do. They suggested getting off of my pill for a week and see if it would &#34;reset&#34; anything but instead my body was reacting the same as it did when I was on my birth control. Yes, I have been on my birth control this entire time which is why it is so abnormal. The bleeding is not crazy heavy but enough to wear I would need a tampon some weeks and it likes to disappear and then reappear so I never know whether it is fully over or not. I have read other women having these issues but it only lasting a total of 2 weeks and mine has been happening since 5/13.

                                                Heavy menstrual period occurred right after shot was administered. My cycle is usually regular, I was not supposed to have a period for two weeks. Nothing else would have affected it (no birth control, no chance of pregnancy).

I am not under any extra stress, nothing major in my life has changed, I have not been ill, and my diet has not changed. There is no possible way I am currently pregnant.

                                                I felt severe arm pain after the injection.  About 12 hours later I had a fever of 100.1 and went to bed.  At 1 am I went to the restroom and passed a good deal of blood as I am on my period.  I got up and then fell to the floor.  Then I went to my parents bedroom and fell again.  I drank two bottles of water and took Tylenol at that point and after about two hours I felt better and went to sleep.  I also twisted my ankle when I fell the first time.  I have never fainted nor have I had such severe cramps or passed so much blood associated with a period.

                                                started bleeding, period symptoms, and it has progressed much worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 21-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 29Mar2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included birth control. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA shot) taken for birth control. Within an hour of receiving, patient started bleeding, period symptoms at 04:00 PM on 29Mar2021, and it has progressed much worse. This makes patient question the integrity of her birth control, a depo shot once every 3 months. Patient visited doctor or other healthcare professional office for the event. No treatment received. It was unknown if patient had covid prior vaccination. No other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not test covid post vaccination. Outcome of the event was recovering.    Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had a menstrual flow on 12/30/2020 and 12/31/2020 that was heavier than I?ve ever experienced. This was particularly abnormal because I had already had my period from 12/08/2020 through 12/18/2020. The length of which isn?t abnormal because they are usually long but light, due to utilizing my birth control to have only a single period every three months. Then, it seemingly disappeared until 01/06/2021 and 01/07/2021 when I experienced some spotting, but then on 01/08/2021 I had a normal amount of flow for a regular period that appeared to stop before I woke up on 01/10/2021. As of today 02/13/2021 I have yet to experience more bleeding.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.

I felt as though it was necessary to report because my doctors have no idea what is causing this, and nothing else could be affecting it. I have been bleeding for 2 weeks now (starting April 5), with clots around 5&#34;. I had a full CBC in January and found nothing abnormal that could explain this, including no history of extended bleeding (historical max of 7 days).

No temperature measured except the 16th when temperature fluctuations measured between 94-98 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day (fluctuating fairly quickly with multiple degree differences within minutes of each other, thermometer was correct when compared with a second thermometer&#39;s readings)  Migraines all day Tuesday (13th of April) and Wednesday (14th of April) with severe nausea worsening at night, stayed laying or sitting down to keep from throwing up. Period (menstruation) started this day as well, and bleeding was heavier than normal with severe cramps which I never experience. Migraines are also never experienced as a symptom of menstruation. Migraines continued until Monday April 19th but were much lighter and without nausea or stomach cramping. Period ends today (April 21rst), the blood having been heavy the entire time.   Outcome: I am still getting headaches but nothing as severe as before and am able to go about normal life again.   Treatment: Did not see any professionals for symptoms. Took Ibuprofen for pain on Saturday and Sunday (and avoided pain killers at all before that for fear of that possibly being dangerous and complicating things if my condition had worsened and I needed to seek medical care). Saturday and Sunday I only took 1 dose each day. I did take coffee to try to help with the migraines Saturday and Sunday as well and that with the Ibuprofen helped a little bit.

I have also been experiencing a much lighter than usual menstrual cycle. A few days following my vaccination I was also experiencing pain in my left lung (this has since subsided).

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                4/30 - Five minutes after the vaccine, I passed out. I felt uncontrollably shaky and my vision went white. I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

                                                About three days after vaccine, I started bleeding and getting blood clots. I went to ER to make sure I wasn&#39;t miscarrying. I wasn&#39;t that day. Everything looked okay. Baby was measuring much smaller than it should be. I kept bleeding lightly for a couple of days. Tuesday I was bleeding heavily - I went to ER again. Hormone levels - were going up but not as they should be. From Tuesday - Friday, I didn&#39;t bleed. I started bleeding on Saturday again. And I&#39;m still bleeding. I called my OB today and she is going to call me back in the morning to let me know what to do. I was last seen on Friday at ER again.   Pregnancy History - One other pregnancy - carried twins fine. Estimated date of delivery for this pregnancy - January 17, 2022.

Symptoms began roughly 3.5 hours after second dose and are still continuing in waves nearly 8 hours later. I have had my menstrual cycle for nearly 15 years and have never experienced anything like this. Recently I had a well-women?s check-up/PAP and results were normal, so no reason to suspect any health issues that may suddenly cause this. I have tried applying heat, taking a magnesium supplement, and massaging my stomach to no avail.

                                                I didn&#39;t experience any symptoms other than soreness at the injection site in the 48 hours I got the vaccine on Wednesday, March 10, until Friday, March 26, where I had serious period cramps on top of fatigue, headache, fever, and chills.  In the 24 hours since the first symptom was identified, the headache and the chills disappeared, leaving a little bit of fatigue and fluctuating fever.   The last I checked, I have a 100.3 degree Fahrenheit fever.  I check my temperature every hour or so.

I wear an Ava watch that tracks my cycle, and based on the data from this month ovulation did not occur. I believe that the shot does affect cycles and fertility as I asked two of my friends that have experienced similar symptoms.

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

                                                I had a severe headache with sensitivity to light, a very sore arm, and fatigue the day after the second shot. Fatigue continued for several days.   take combination estradiol birth control on a 28 day cycle with 7 placebo pills, and have for 9 years. Normally I begin withdrawal bleeds 1-2 days after I start the placebo pills, and have one day of moderate-light bleeding with cramping, and two days of light bleeding with occasional spotting the fourth day.   The first menstrual cycle I had about a week after the second shot, this was not the case. The withdrawal bleeding began several days late (day 4 or 5 of the placebo week) and was extremely light, only lasting for one day. I took a pregnancy.  I had a severe headache with sensitivity to light, a very sore arm, and fatigue the day after the second shot. Fatigue continued for several days.  More significantly, I take combination estradiol birth control on a 28 day cycle with 7 placebo pills, and have for 9 years. Normally I begin withdrawal bleeds 1-2 days after I start the placebo pills, and have one day of moderate-light bleeding with cramping, and two days of light bleeding with occasional spotting the fourth day.   The first menstrual cycle I had about a week after the second shot, this was not the case. The withdrawal bleeding began several days late (day 4 or 5 of the placebo week) and was extremely light, only lasting for one day. I took a pregnancy test which was negative. A week later, I began to experience breast soreness, lasting up through the next withdrawal bleeding cycle; I took a second pregnancy test just before the second placebo week. In the next placebo pill week, I experienced 5 days of heavy bleeding, the first two of which presented with severe cramping, which has not happened in many years.

My cycles are between 35 and 40 days, so this was strange. I had the copper IUD put in in December so my body is still adjusting and I have very heavy periods.  I have recently started my normal period afterward. The only change otherwise was receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer.

A 24-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 02Mar2021 08:30 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications that the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 09Feb2021 08:30 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Pins and needles/numbness in left leg through foot began about 3 hours after 2nd dose (from 02Mar2021 12:00). Extreme muscle tightness in left calf. Ultrasound done on calf came back negative. Full brain/spinal cord scan done to detect demyelination of nerves - MRI came back normal. EMG done on left leg to check for peripheral nerve damage - EMG came back normal. Almost 8 weeks post 2nd dose and still experiencing muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms, specifically in legs through feet. Hands and feet &#34;fall asleep&#34;/go numb very frequently, even when the extremities are not restricted in any way. No medication or other treatment given for symptoms. Extremely heavy and painful menstrual cycle this month (1 month after 2nd vaccine, Apr2021), which is extremely abnormal for patient. Events were assessed as serious with criteria of Disabling/Incapacitating. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Three days after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began menstruating 5 days ahead of schedule. My period has been regular for years now so it was unusual for it to begin so early, it has also continued longer than usual. Typically my periods last 5 days at most, but this one is still continuing on day 8. Other than the unusual timing and long duration, there does not seem to be anything concerning about it but I felt I should report it incase this turns out to be a significant side effect of the vaccine.

The consistency of the blood was much thinner than what I generally experience during my period. On the second day after, I am currently experiencing occasional pain in my genital area. This is embarrassing for me to write but I know others who have experienced similar side effects. For this reason, I feel the need to voice this side effect.

It was shocking because I have not had anything that would cause it except for the vaccine. My body feels healthy otherwise.

                                                The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was taken on March 15th at 8:30. Within a week I started feeling weak joints, headaches followed by a sharp pain on the occipital lobe. I started my period for the second time that month, which was odd because it never happened to me before. I went to work that week, but by Friday (March 30th) I was not able to handle the pain so after work I went to the doctor and they took blood to see if there was anything going on. The result came back the following day and everything was normal. I was given medicine (muscle relaxers) for the occipital pain, but it was not enough. At that time I was not sure what was the cause of it, I thought it was a bad flu, but I didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that it was because of the vaccine, because a week had passed by, so I thought it was impossible. The doctor asked for me to take an X-Ray for the occipital pain, so I did (March 30th) and it resulted in everything being fine. She also recommended for me to get an abdominal ultrasound to see if my uterus was fine due to the second period. I currently took the second Pfizer dose in the same location, but this time around I felt all of these symptoms within 3 hours of the vaccination. I started feeling lightheaded and dazed, my joints started feeling weak, my mouth and tongue started feeling sensitive (fever blisters and sensitive to anything that is acidic, spicy, etc).  I have not visited the doctor this time around because the pain is tolerable. I have noticed in increase of joint pain as the days go by.

So far I am on day 3 of this period and had to change my cup 4 times throughout the night where I usually only need to change it once or twice. As I am very anemic this is concerning.

                                                Extreme change in menstrual cycle. I got cramps the same day as the vaccine, more than a week early, which has never happened before in my life. I have already had my period for over 9 days, and it is not done yet, which is already much longer than normal. Stronger cramps and stronger flow. It also started differently than normal, with light bleeding for days at the beginning. I also felt much stronger depression than I have ever felt in my life before. It was overwhelming. I was about to change my birth control method before I put the two together because the pain, flow, and depression were so bad it was unbearable. I was unable to work. I did not report these symptoms on my follow-up survey that I received every day for a week after because I did not know it was connected to the vaccine. I feel so relieved to understand what is going on.

RN recommended rest, light meals such as soup and lots of fluids and to continue to monitor herself and if these sx continue to make an appt with her PCP for further evaluation. She was agreeable.

Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.

Pt went to a Drs office for a physical, a pap smear and HPV testing. Results came back normal. Ob/gyn prescribed birth control pill to regulate periods taken daily. Since beginning birth control, spotting was still consistent, every day. Pt was prescribed a different form of  hormonal birth control pill  which pt has not began yet.
