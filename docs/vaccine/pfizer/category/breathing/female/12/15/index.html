About 2 minutes after receiving the shot she lost consciousness and pharmacy staff called 911 for EMTs. She regained consciousness approximately 1 minute later; stated she was a little short of breath. Pharmacist asked her to state her name (was coherent and aware) and asked her to take a breath normally; she was able to do so and could breathe normally with no difficulty. Her father laid her on the floor because she was still light-headed, but could breathe normally. EMT arrived very shortly after and began taking her pulse, checking her pulse-ox, and blood pressure. Pulse was on lower end, blood pressure was around 80/50, pulse ox normal. She was taken to ER per her father&#39;s request for further examination.

                                                6/12 - patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Worsened gradually with difficulty swallowing. 6/16 - presented to ED. Patient also reported rash in right lower extremity that is pruritic, 2 episodes of non-bloody non-bilious emesis daily since Saturday, intermittent chest pain and dyspnea, myalgias, diarrhea, generalized abdominal pain, and neck pain. Concern for infectious mononucleosis with lymphadenitis. Prescribed Augmentin and discharged home. 6/17 - returned to ED due to worsening rash (no longer pruritic) and diarrhea. Continued fever and neck pain. Hypotensive requiring 3L bolus and norepi. Large volume diarrhea. Mild AKI that resolved with fluid resuscitation. Treated broadly with antibiotics for toxic shock syndrome but rash was not consistent and cultures were negative, so eventually narrowed to ampicillin-sulbactam. Neck pain and swelling improved, but fever persisted through 6/19. Transferred to the floor on 6/20 and gradually improved without further intervention. Antibiotics were continued to target possible tonsillitis/lymphadenitis, but course did not seem to be truly responding to these antibiotics. CRP continued to increase despite antibiotics. Patient&#39;s presentation seemed most consistent with MIS-C; she also met criteria for incomplete KD with fever, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy and lab abnormalities, but this was felt less likely and she was not treated with IVIG or any other anti-inflammatories. Patient eventually improved and was discharged home 6/24.

                                                Patient reported having difficulty breathing about 5-10 minutes after COVID-a9 vaccine administration. She took her mask off to allow for easier breathing and was given water and 25 mg benadryl. She sat for about 30 minutes and began to feel better. Patient&#39;s dad stated that she often gets worked up when getting a vaccine and is anxious about the possible side effects she may experience. Patient and father left. We called them about 1 hour later and spoke with father who said she is feeling better and thinks it was all self-induced.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                The day after my daughter received her vaccine, she began to feel congested and tired. This was on Sunday, May 23. We got up for school on Monday, May 24, but she was complaining about a really bad sore throat. The school nurse called and I picked her up from school because she was also getting more congested. She began to cough and sneeze constantly and took a long nap. When she woke, she was saying that she was getting short of breath and it felt like her heart was racing, even though she was just sitting. The next day her throat felt better, but the congestion was the same - still coughing and sneezing but her shortness of breath started getting more obvious. I emailed her pediatrician to ask about bringing her in, and they said to report this to the CDC and bring her if if she&#39;s not better in the next few days. Today is Wednesday, May 26 and she is still congested, short of breath and overall feels lousy. She is coughing up lots of mucus - greenish and thick. Yuck. I just gave her one pill of a mucus reducer to see if that would help. My biggest worry is about the shortness of breath because that is exactly what I experienced after my first dose of the vaccine. Mine was Moderna and I have seen dr&#39;s about it - and actually ended up in the hospital, but they do not believe it to be connected to the vaccine. I will contact them and let them know about my daughter&#39;s shortness of breath and perhaps they will think differently. Oh, she&#39;s had a slight fever of 99 F on occasions during this.

                                                feelings of throat closing 10 minutes after vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician and consumer via Medical Information. A 13-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), intramuscularly on 13May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0179) as the 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was the public health department. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient experienced feelings of throat closing 10 minutes after vaccine on 13May2021 at 11:45. The adverse event (AE) did result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was further reported that the throat felt like it was closing 5-10 minutes after administration and they got medical advise 30 minutes after the shot. All vitals were normal and no other symptoms. Diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) was administered. Symptoms resolved within 2 hours. The patient recovered from the event on 13May2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine and known the potential for severe allergic reactions after vaccination, a causal relationship between event &#34;throat felt like it was closing 5-10 minutes after administration&#34; and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She also had a headache and troubles breathing. She had belly pain, as well. On Wednesday, around lunch break she called me to pick her up, she had troubles breathing and headache and feeling blah. Also on the first evening,  Her arm was hurting and her left body side was hurting. (Wednesday this got a little bitter but she still had pain on her front left side -- especially her left leg.)  I took her to primary care and he prescribed Prednisone.  Prednisone started then. On Thursday, she still had troubles breathing and she stayed home from school. On Friday, it was okay for her to go to school.

                                                On 05-22-2021, participant&#39;s mother states her daughter pain started at about 1:00AM. I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

This progressed over the next several hours to the next morning to include swelling of the face and neck, tightness of the throat and chest, and progression of the rash to involve all of the arms, chest, and legs. The rash was a fine maculopapular rash that was itchy. Over the next 3 days the symptoms did not progress further, but they also did not subside. On day 7 after the 2nd dose, she was placed on a Medrol Dose pack. The swelling of the face and sensation of tight throat began to ease by the next day. After completion of the steroid regimen, her skin is dry and flaky with mild tightness in the skin of the face. However, most of the rash has gone and the tightness in the throat is absent.

She said her throat felt swollen.  A couple hours after a double dose of benadryl and ice packs she began to improve.   4th day she was much better. We spoke with her allergist over the phone, and he said it was reasonable to chalk the reaction up to extra stress on her body due to the vaccine/her bodies response to the vaccine. We only did half her peanut dose. 5th day she was normal.

                                                Patient is a 13-year-old who was transferred from another hospital for chest pain in the setting of Covid vaccination.   She received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, June 29.  On Wednesday she developed fatigue chest pain shortness of breath weakness, nausea and mild abdominal pain.  She also had a fever to 102.5 Fahrenheit.  mom is a nurse and took her pulse and felt that it was 30 and fast.  She then took 1 with her home equipment it was in the 120s.  She called her neighbor who took her pulse and it was in the 130s.  She then transferred her to another Hospital for further care at hospital her vital sinus evaluation was a temperature of 37.4 pulse 119 respiratory rate is 15 blood pressure 106/62 satting 98% on room air.  On exam she was well appearing with tenderness to palpation of sternum heart rate normal rate and rhythm lungs clear bilaterally and abdominal exam benign. they obtain CBC with white count of 4.8 hemoglobin 12.9 Camm that was unremarkable LFTs are within normal limits troponin that was negative BNP 223 with a normal upper limit of 125 ESR 2 D-dimer 0.697 with upper limit of normal 0.5 and a CRP of 9 with upper limit of normal of 8.1.  UA bland. She was given Toradol for chest pain EKG with sinus tachycardia .  She was given 1/2 L normal saline bolus ondansetron Toradol and started on maintenance IV fluids of D5 NS.  She was then transferred to another hospital for further care .    Upon arrival here she notes improvement in her energy level and all of her pain except for her chest pain.  She describes it as a pressure on top of her chest that is right in the center and is worse with movement and deep breaths.   Of note she had a appendectomy a few years ago that was complicated by surgeons making the bowel and then required her to have a bowel resection.  She has no dietary restrictions and eats by mouth, no GI complications in the long-term.     PMH: as above  PSH: No significant past surgical history  FH: Reviewed and noncontributory to current presentation  SH: Lives with caregivers   Meds: None  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Immunizations: UTD   Review of Systems       Constitutional:  fever, no chills, no sweats,  fatigue Skin: no rash, no lesions,  Eye: no redness ENMT: no ear pain, no sore throat, no congestion, no hoarseness  Respiratory: &#43; shortness of breath, no cough, no wheezing  Cardiovascular: &#43; chest pain, no palpitations,  Gastrointestinal: &#43; nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no GI bleeding  Genitourinary: no dysuria, no hematuria,  Musculoskeletal:  &#43; muscle pain,  Neurologic: no headache, no dizziness, no numbness, no weakness  Psychiatric: no sleeping problems,  Allergy/Immunologic: no recurrent infections,  Additional ROS info: All other systems of a 10 system review are negative.  Briefly, patient is presenting with chest pain, myalgias, and fever in setting of recent covid vaccine (2nd dose Pfizer 2 days ago).  Seen at an outside hospital where labs were notable for mildly elevated BNP and D-dimer, negative troponin, normal LFTs and chemistries.  Chest x-ray reportedly negative.  EKG with T wave inversions in V1 through V4 (read as nonspecific ST changes by their physician), but otherwise normal.  Given the possibility of post Covid vaccine myocarditis or PE, transferred for further management.  Patient states that after Toradol that she received the outside hospital all of her other symptoms have resolved but she continues to have chest pain.     My exam showed: Gen: tired but nontoxic appearing, no acute distress, alert and active; HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Chest: significant reproducible chest pain; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion, brisk radial pulses bilaterally; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: no rashes     Chest pain. Overall well appearing with normal exam with reproducible tenderness.  Given recent Covid vaccine, must consider myocarditis, although only mildly elevated BNP and negative troponin at the outside hospital are reassuring, especially given reproducible pain and reassuring EKG.  Symptoms then may represent musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or myositis related to vaccination.  Less likely pneumonia or pneumothorax, but possible.  Low suspicion for PE given lack of persistent tachycardia (tachycardia improved while in ED, currently HR 80s) or hypoxia. EKG obtained which showed T wave inversions in V1-V4 (normal for age).  Bedside ultrasound with normal global function and lack of pericardial effusion.  Labs obtained in BCH ED notable for negative BNP and troponin, along with reassuring lipase given abdominal pain.  Thus, unlikely to be true myocarditis, more likely musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or chest wall pain.  Cardiology will discuss with mom for reassurance.  Final Diagnosis  1. Chest pain R07.9 2. Fever R50.9 3. Fatigue R53.83 4. Shortness of breath R06.00  PLEASE NOTE:  Since the patient is not from here, we do not have access to her vaccination records and cannot supply lot number, etc.

Her skin color becamee gray, her lips turned blue. The seizure last approximately 20 seconds and when she came out of it she was able to breathe but said her throat felt funny, scratchy, smaller - but she was still able to breathe. She was nauseous, head hurt and was very disoriented for approximately 20-30 minutes. The pharmacist called 911. 911 arrived and took her blood, did a multitude to tests which all came out ok. We opted not to take her to the hospital as she was breathing ok, and her color was returning.

                                                Around 7PM on June 19th, she had chest pain and chest pressure. She also had a mild headache. She was taking a walk in the neighborhood and had to come home because she was experiencing shortness of breath and having difficulty breathing. She described it as an electric shock/shooting pain in her chest area, on both sides. I took her (the participant) to the ER. While at the ER, she started to feel experience pain and tingling in her left thigh. It would feel better if her leg was elevated. The leg pain subsided by the 20th. On the 21st, she was taken back to the ER because the chest pain and shortness of breath was not subsiding. They did another EKG which showed no abnormalities. Blood work came back with the same indication of virus/inflammation. They gave her a pain med (not sure of the exact name, but it is used for patients after surgery) and an IV. Also given a prescription for 27ml of ibuprofen with Tylenol in between. Two days later, on the 23rd, she had an appointment with the pediatrician. The doctor checked muscle tone and listened to her chest. My daughter gets fatigued by going up a single flight of stairs. Doctor referred her to a pediatric cardiologist. Later that night of the 23rd, she began to get a tingling sensation in her left arm that went down to her hands and lightheadedness. She was not able to move and had to lay down. Being upright made the pressure in her chest worse and she had to take shallow breaths. I took her to the ER. They did a chest x-ray that showed no abnormalities. Referred her for an echo cardiogram on the 24th. She was doing better after that until July 5th, when the pressure and pain started getting worse again. I took her to the pediatrician again and they referred her to rheumatologist on the 11th of July. The rheumatologist prescribed a steroid medication to calm her immune system. She said her immune system was activated and was inflamed, which is why she was experiencing the shortness of breath and pain. She prescribed her colchicine and Aleve. Since she has started to take the meds, she is doing better but she is still experiencing pressure at a lesser level. The pain is the same level that feels like static shock.

The patient waited in the facility for the standard 15 minutes when fainted (syncope). I rushed over within 10 seconds to turn the patient onto her back. I checked for a pulse and breathing. There was a faint pulse and breathing initially, which seemed to stabilize after about 2-3 minutes. She became conscious again after about 2 minutes of unconsciousness. Patient was diaphoretic with shallow and rapid breathing. EMT was called and arrived about 20 minutes later. Blood pressure read by the EMT: 105/56 about 30-40 minutes after the injection (20-25 minutes after the syncope). Patient was not given anything for treatment besides purified water. Patient was told to follow-up with primary care doctor for the second dose if required.

                                                Patient was administered the first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine per protocol and was seated for observation post administration.  She became faint.  Pharmacy staff  broke an ammonia inhalant to help the patient recover.  She responded quickly, but did require additional whiffs later.  When questioned, she stated that she was having no difficulty breathing, swelling in throat,  and no obvious rash.  She was accompanied by her mother, who  declined emergency medical care/911 assistance.  The patient was not wearing constrictive clothing, so no adjustments were necessary, but she did recline further in the chair.  She was also provided with cool, wet, paper towels for her forehead and neck.  When she was feeling better, she had a few sips of water.  Although offered a motorized cart to leave the store, she left with both parents walking with no assistance.  On 5/20/21 we reached out to the family and spoke with her father.  The patient did have a minor  headache the evening of her vaccine administration, which has resolved.  She does have a sore arm, which is a common side effect of the vaccine,  Her father has reached out to her pediatrician to see whether she should get the second dose or not.  He has not yet received a response.

                                                Pt received her 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine in the right arm at approximately 2:45 PM on May 29 at pharmacy. Pt was recommended to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting area after vaccination for observation, but she and mom opted to go shopping in the store. At approximately 3:37 PM, pt and mom came back to the pharmacy to tell me (the pharmacist) that she had hives and showed me red bumps on her left arm. I had the pt sit while mom went to go buy Benadryl. After 5 minutes, I checked on the pt. She had taken one dose of Benadryl and stated that she was dizzy and feeling itchy all over. After chatting with mom for 5-10 minutes, the pt stated that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening and were stabilizing. The pt then said she wanted to rest at home. I recommended she sit for a little longer, but mom stated she would keep a close eye on the pt and had an epipen at home. They then left the pharmacy. I followed up with mom on May 30th at approximately 4:00 PM to see how the pt was doing, and she stated that they were at the ER because the symptoms were not getting any better, and the pt &#34;felt like she was having an asthma attack.&#34; Pt&#39;s mom states that the pt is doing much better after receiving IV meds.

                                                Starting early morning  after vaccine, approximately 15 hours after vaccine, patient developed severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. Her fever was high throughout the day (often 102.8 even after Tylenol and Ibuprofen).  I am a physician and my husband is as well, we monitored her heart rate, oxygenation, temperature, and symptoms at home. We called her doctor and asked whether this could be myocarditis and whether we should go to the ER. She felt that we should just have her rest and monitor her vitals. I dosed her with two large doses of Ibuprofen (600 mg twice during the day), and by 6 pm on 6/4 her chest pain started to improve and her fever broke. The severe crushing chest pain lasted about 12 hours.

Pediatrician evaluated patient and ordered chest X-ray which was normal. Pediatrician referred us to ER for further evaluation. At the ER they did blood work, EKG, urinalysis. EKG was normal. Labs came back showing elevated D Dimer so they ordered a CT scan of her chest which came back normal. They also ordered a coagulation profile which came back normal. We were released from the ER and told to monitor if symptoms continued. She had no symptoms of shortness of breath or palpitations while at the ER. As of today she continues to have very short episodes of palpitations but has not had shortness of breath.

                                                Experienced lump formed in middle to base of throat and right cheek became swollen. Lump in throat was the size of a quarter but did not block her airway passage. Doctor checked her airway passage, heart, and pulse. Took one Zyrtec administered by mom, because she is allergic to Benadryl. The Zyrtec was given around 2:45 PM. After 10 minutes the lump in middle to base of her throat and right cheek did not reduce in size. She was able to drink water and her mom,  and gave her another Zyrtec pill. This is an emergency plan for provided by her allergy doctor. This was an emergency event for her with all of her known allergies. After 20 minutes, she began to feel the lump in her throat slowly decrease in size. She was being monitored by Dr. and a Nurse, and additional nurses on staff. Dr. continued to check her heart, airway passage, and pulse. As the lump continued to reduce in size after 45 minutes to 1 hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, she was able to get up and walk around with a pulse monitor on her finger to monitor her heart rate and breathing. She did not have any concerns while walking nor while sitting in the office and was being watched by the staff. In the very beginning after giving her the Zyrtec she need to keep her mask off to ensure her breathing stayed under control. We were able to leave  and did not need the EpiPen administered by staff nor by her mother. We were able to leave around 3:45PM. We received follow up calls from the Nurse at 4:54 PM and from Dr. around 5:30 PM to check on her. At 11:00 PM I did give her 1 Zyrtec before bed. I woke her up on June 17th at 6:15 AM and asked her to drink some water. After drinking water she noticed she had a lump in her throat. Her mom gave her another Zyrtec. She was watched closely  throughout the remaining week and was in contact with her doctors office. Patient also experienced pain in her throat due to all the swelling/inflammation. Since receiving the vaccine, patient has noticed an increased difficulty in wearing her mask. This did occur prior to receiving the vaccine.

She said she has her menstrual cycle and it has never been this bad. She said she didn&#39;t get it last month at all. Prior to this, she said her cycles were normal. She also had pain in her thighs and trouble breathing which resulted in her needing her rescue inhaler.  At this time she has been given ibuprofen and is resting with a heating pad. I as pts. mom am concerned that this may be related to vaccine.

                                                24 hours after vaccine, she had a fever of 106.  A week after, she began having breathing problems (no history) and chest pain.  Symptoms have continued still, and not getting better.  We have been to urgent care, ED, pediatrician, and going to cardiologist soon.  Now has 2 inhalers and OTC pain meds.  I firmly believe the problems are connected to covid vaccine.

                                                Received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday May 16,2021 at around 2:50 pm. At around 7:20 pm on May 16,2021 she stood up to walk to the bathroom. She began feeling nauseous when she stood up. While she was washing her hands, after going to the bathroom, she began to have difficulty with her vision. She describes white and blue dots obstructing her vision in both eyes. She also began to experience loud tinnitus. She described hearing multiple frequencies.  The problem with her vision and the tinnitus continued as she walked through our house to a couch where she laid down. The vision problem and tinnitus continued while she laid on the couch. Her breathing was rapid but she thinks this may have been due to the stress caused by her other symptoms. This episode lasted for several minutes and then the vision problem resolved. The tinnitus continued for several minutes after the vision problem resolved. The intensity of the tinnitus slowly decreased until it finally stopped. The following evening, she experienced tinnitus for a few minutes but it was less intense than it was the previous evening. She very rarely has experienced tinnitus in the past. She has very infrequently experienced brief episodes of orthostatic hypotension when she was dehydrated. When this event occurred, she felt like she was well hydrated. This event lasted much longer and she has never experienced this problem with her vision in the past.

A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23May2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to amoxicillin where it was a couple of times when she was little and she would get blotches and red; and has been vaping without her parents knowing. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON). On 23May2021, the patient experienced breathing reaction. The mother stated that her daughter took the vaccine, she was 15, she was aware of the normal side effect problems and heart problems as she has been hearing in the news, she was concerned because she just figured out her daughter has been vaping without her parents knowing. The mother stated that she was a family therapist, and many teens vape age 12-15, parents don&#39;t have a clue about vaping and the chemicals in the vape that can cause heart and lung problems. She was contacting Pfizer because she wants to make sure this was in the radar, because of side effects. They should consider asking these types of things prior to administering the product. The mother was concerned watching her daughters breathing reaction. Her daughter was better today. The mother was reading side effects on vaping and there was some link to heart and lung issues, some even have lead in the chemicals or nicotine. The mother stated that she has also realized, in general when people ask if they are taking medications, especially for women they don&#39;t say anything about taking pills, or combination of pills. Her daughter experienced a Breathing reaction after the first dose. She was better today, she took the shot on Sunday, she was tired and coughing on an unspecified date but was better now. Her main concern was the age group and the Heart problems for this group. Her First Dose was on 23May2021, she was worse yesterday but today she was better. The breathing reaction started on the 23rd. Yesterday her daughter was in bed all day. Her daughter has made no physician office visit or went to the emergency room because of this. Treatment: Not to her knowledge, Unknown for breathing reaction. The mother again stated that she just wanted to express he concerns with this age group. The patient was recovering from all events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

The morning after while taking their temperature, Maddison said she couldn&#39;t see anything then fell into my arms. Her pupils quickly dilated, she made gutteral sounds while shaking slightly then lost consciousness. I couldn&#39;t see her breathing for about 15 seconds and she was confused when she came to. She couldn&#39;t hear, see or speak during the episode. We took her to the emergency room where a chest xray and ekg came back clear.

She had some of the typical side effects the next day- a sore arm, flu-like body aches, a headache and fatigue. In the middle of the night Wed night/Thurs morning at 3AM she woke up with chest pain and difficulty breathing. In her words, her &#34;heart really hurts and it is hurts to breath.&#34; I gave her 1 (500 mg ) capsule of Tylenol. This was the first pain reliever she had received post shot. She also applied Frankincense oil over her heart. Patient was unable to go back to sleep for a few hours because it hurt too much. She did finally fall back asleep in the early morning hours. Yesterday (Thursday 6/10) she reported that she was feeling a lot better. Her heart was still a little painful but by today, Friday 6/11, she says she feels fine.  When I heard on the news about a number of other children between 12-15 who reported heart pain, I thought we should let you all know. I am a little worried that there might be some kind of long term complication for her heart.

                                                itching all over, even in her ears; feeling short of breath; Chest hurting; itching all over, even in her ears; skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s grandmother/Guardian). A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it. The blotchiness and chest pain resolved quickly, but the itchiness continued. Patient also complained of stomach pain, which occurred after patient&#39;s grandmother gave her a loratadine. The loratadine settled the itching down, but patient reported nausea the next morning and shortness of breath, as well. Patient received Claritin 24 Hr for the events as treatment. The outcome of the skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs and chest hurting was recovered on May-2021 and recovered for rest of the events in 2021  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.

She complained of the symptoms on Thursday morning and then we saw on the news that night that this was a newly discovered side effect for younger patients receiving the vaccine. She has not met with the doctor yet because she didn&#39;t want to miss final tests at school and the offices were closed for the weekend.  However, we have been monitoring her closely and had hoped it would disappear by now, but we will be seeking treatment tomorrow since it has not gotten worse, but it also hasn&#39;t improved after 4 days of rest.

                                                About an hour after receiving the 2nd vaccine, she developed a pain in the upper-mid sternal area.  She&#39;s not had any pain like this in the past.  The pain remained constant ever since it started, and there don&#39;t appear to be any alleviating factors such as position changes.  Deep inspiration makes it worse.  The pain radiates at times across the upper chest and down the back.  She&#39;s had some accompanying nausea.  She&#39;s also noticed feeling a little short of breath as the day progressed, which is not necessarily related to the pain.  She denies any palpitations or dizziness.  No near syncope or syncope.  The pain remained  a maximum intensity of 10/10. She therefore presented to the ER. Diagnostic studies including labs, EKG and a CT pulmonary angiogram were performed.  Troponin returned as elevated, but without EKG changes. She was transferred at the time to the Medical Center for admission. Echocardiogram was completed and normal. Vital signs remained normal. Troponin trended down. Pain improved and she was discharged home.

                                                My daughter received her second Pfizer vaccinations at 2:15 pm.  At 1230 at night she work up with stabbing chest pain in the center of her chest that lasted three hours.  She initially said her felt faint and couldn?t catch her breath as well as initial nausea.  Being an advanced healthcare professional, I spent five minutes of asking her questions:  did she eat something bad, did she feel like she needed and inhaler, did she need to use the restroom, checked her pulse (100bpm with palpitations), no resolve.  We live 5 minutes from hospital where we prefer to go, but my daughter didn?t think she could make the five minute ride there.  We went to ER that is around the block from us  and it was total chaos.  40 &#43; people in the waiting room to be seen. My daughter was visibly in distress, crying and couldn?t keep still because of the intense chest pain she rated a 10 out of 10.  Finally they did a 12 lead EKG.  The rolled us to the back of the waiting room.  After 15 minutes, I rolled back out to the front desk and no attention to her and her severe chest pain.  Finally I announced we were going to hospital.  The called back to us? ?Good Luck!? Got pt to hospital and the  immediately did EKG, lab work, chest x ray, urinalysis. The  chest pain became intermittent then final subsided.  The doctors ruled out pneumonia, No PE, EKG WNL, lab work fine.  The Doctor stated it was chest wall pain and gave us a NSAID prescription. I talked to my sister who is an nurse works in the vaccination clinics.  She said she has  had patients who have had bouts of pericarditis and pleurisy after the second shot.  That motivated me to google second dose Pfizer reaction in teens.  There is a rare side effect of myocarditis in the teen population after the second dose.  The publication date was June 4  the day before my daughters reaction.  I didn?t thinsk the ER physician was aware of the the possible rare side effect of myocarditis in teens.  I was happy with the care we did receive.

The following week she had a very heavy period that lasted longer than usual with severe cramps and occasional lightheaded/dizzy spells. After her cycle ended, she continued having  brief episodes of dizziness, usually when going from sitting to standing, usually resolved quickly (after a few minutes) with rest. Over the past two weeks, the episodes have become more frequent and intense, and over the past few days episodes also include s/s of seeing spots and having blurred vision with nausea, SOB, and palpitations/tachycardia. Tonight while at lacrosse practice, pt suddenly became dizzy and felt like she might pass out, became diaphoretic and pale.

                                                Two hours after the second dose of the vaccine my daughter developed a sore throat. The next day she felt better but her throat still hurt. On the fifth day she complained  that she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe so I took her to the ER. She was diagnosed with an Allergic reaction because her throat was swollen and she was prescribed some Prednisone. They gave her Benadryl and Steroids. It has been nine days and it seems to be a little better but her throat still hurts and she is very tired.

She said her throat felt tight and like it was closing and she could not take a deep breath. I told the patient to take sips of water but she said that wasn&#39;t helping.  Her throat still felt very tight and she couldn&#39;t breathe. I gave the patient 1 benadryl 25mg capsule. I continued to ask her to sip water and take deep breaths. After about 10-15 minutes she said she still felt like someone was choking her. I gave her another 25mg benadryl. The entire time the patient&#39;s mother was present and consented to provide Benadryl. After 10 more minutes, the patient said she still did not feel well, but did not want an Epi-Pen.  Another pharmacist called WellNow (in our parking lot) and they said the patient could go there to be monitored. WellNow said the patient was just tired and they did not administer any further medication.

When she woke up in the morning she had crampy pain in the epigastric abdominal area.  Pain is constant, worsened some with laying down and improved with sitting up.  She feels like she has some mild difficulty breathing when she is lying flat.  She has not been able to eat much because eating makes her feel like her stomach is going to explode.  She is barely keeping down much water due to pain. She denies any nausea or vomiting.

                                                At around 9:25 am on Thursday, June 17th, 2021, a fifteen-year-old patient walked into the vaccination site. She was accompanied by two guardians, along with 14 other minors. The minors came in for their 2nd shot of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines.  Patient signed all necessary consent forms and pre-vaccination checklist requirements with guardian and entered the vaccination section at approx. 9:38 am. The Pfizer vaccine was administered at 9:45 am.  Patient was one of the first minor patients of the group that complained of a severe headache to observation nurse. Observation nurse gave Gatorade to the patient and she took a sip of Gatorade and was calm afterward. One of the patient?s guardians instructed her to head back to the van with the rest of the group.  At approximately 10:33 am observation nurse notified charge nurse that another minor patient was having a reaction to the vaccine in the parking lot area.   One of our site specialists was the first to attend to patient. Site specialist stated that she saw the patient walking with one of her guardians in the parking lot and looked like she was about to faint.   Charge nurse hooked up patient to the pulse oximetry and called 911 at approx. 10:34 am. The patient?s O2 level was 83 with a pulse of 107. The charge nurse observed that the patient was under a lot of stress and was hyperventilating and unable to verbalize how she was feeling. Shortly after, the patient fainted due to hyperventilation. Observation nurse advised the patient to calm down and take deep breaths but the patient did not comply and continued rapid breathing. The patient started to vomit and made some gurgling sounds in her mouth and the charge nurse with the help of site specialist laid the patient on her left side. Shortly after, the patient stopped breathing.   Observation nurse administered the epi-pen on the patient?s right thigh. Immediately after administering the epi-pen, patient started to breathe again with an O2 level of 98 with a pulse of 110; but the patient was still unconscious and unresponsive. At approx. 10:36 am first responder paramedics arrived at the scene and took the patient to hospital for further evaluation.

A 15-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included no other illness. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously received Amoxicillin, Azithromicin, Cefdinir, Gardasil(Pf) and had allergy. The patient had Nausea that does not go away with Gardasil. She also received HPV vaccine previously and experienced nausea and the dizziness for a month. Reporter stated, &#34;she did not have any allergic &#39;condition&#39; (not clear) but she was allergic, she had always had a rash when she had this Amoxicillin this antibiotic. She was allergic to Penicillin.&#34; The patient had the COVID Pfizer Vaccine on 15May2021 and as soon as she had her first dose she started to feel nausea and dizziness and from there 5 days later she had, she felt a terrible headache, &#39;this heaviness&#39; (not clarified), headache, dizziness, palpitation. The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine.

This case pertains to patient 3 of 3. A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727; Expiry Date: 31Jul2021), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jun2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. On 17Jun2021, after 15 minutes of observation, the patient had a severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness and stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. On an unspecified date, the patient also had nausea and vomiting. The patient pulse ox (documented as provided by caller) went down to 83%, she had severe headache, nausea, vomiting and she was unconscious. When she was unconscious was when her pulse ox was 83% and she stopped breathing intermittently for 10 to 12 seconds at a time. Then she started breathing again but was not responsive after she received the epinephrine then her pulse ox steadily rose again but was not responsive. She was like this until EMS took her away. The reporter stated that the most severe case was for this particular patient. She had already been vaccinated and had already gone through the 15 minute observation. All these kids came in a bus together, but this patient was sitting in the vehicle after the observation when the guardian brought her back to the nurses saying that she was complaining of a severe headache and at that point she had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness. The nurses reported that it appeared that she stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. At that time they administered epi (epinephrine) and called EMS. Her pulse ox and her breathing improved after the administration of epi, however she remained unresponsive when she was on the way to the hospital with EMS. The patient was taken to the hospital and she did improve. This was the 2nd dose, she had the 1st dose and did not have a reaction to it. The seriousness of the events severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as medically significant. The reporter stated that it was very serious. This patient reaction was a little more intense than just an anxiety induced reaction. She says with a pulse ox of 83% if they had not intervened then this would of been life threatening. It is medically significant but if they had not intervened then it would have been life threatening especially when you&#39;re talking about gurgling and a pulse ox of 83%. The reporter tends to think that with that severe of a reaction, with the pulse ox that low and her being unresponsive, she believes that this was probably a true adverse event. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  The reported causality for the events severe headache, had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as related.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, dyspnea and headache and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                My daughter developed shortness of breath Sunday morning 6/27. She thought it was her asthma and took 2 doses of her rescue inhaler. That didn?t help and she said she had chest pain. We went to the emergency room at hospital. She was admitted for pericarditis and elevated troponin level.
