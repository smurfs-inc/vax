About 2 minutes after receiving the shot she lost consciousness and pharmacy staff called 911 for EMTs. She regained consciousness approximately 1 minute later; stated she was a little short of breath. Pharmacist asked her to state her name (was coherent and aware) and asked her to take a breath normally; she was able to do so and could breathe normally with no difficulty. Her father laid her on the floor because she was still light-headed, but could breathe normally. EMT arrived very shortly after and began taking her pulse, checking her pulse-ox, and blood pressure. Pulse was on lower end, blood pressure was around 80/50, pulse ox normal. She was taken to ER per her father&#39;s request for further examination.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                The day after my daughter received her vaccine, she began to feel congested and tired. This was on Sunday, May 23. We got up for school on Monday, May 24, but she was complaining about a really bad sore throat. The school nurse called and I picked her up from school because she was also getting more congested. She began to cough and sneeze constantly and took a long nap. When she woke, she was saying that she was getting short of breath and it felt like her heart was racing, even though she was just sitting. The next day her throat felt better, but the congestion was the same - still coughing and sneezing but her shortness of breath started getting more obvious. I emailed her pediatrician to ask about bringing her in, and they said to report this to the CDC and bring her if if she&#39;s not better in the next few days. Today is Wednesday, May 26 and she is still congested, short of breath and overall feels lousy. She is coughing up lots of mucus - greenish and thick. Yuck. I just gave her one pill of a mucus reducer to see if that would help. My biggest worry is about the shortness of breath because that is exactly what I experienced after my first dose of the vaccine. Mine was Moderna and I have seen dr&#39;s about it - and actually ended up in the hospital, but they do not believe it to be connected to the vaccine. I will contact them and let them know about my daughter&#39;s shortness of breath and perhaps they will think differently. Oh, she&#39;s had a slight fever of 99 F on occasions during this.

                                                feelings of throat closing 10 minutes after vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician and consumer via Medical Information. A 13-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), intramuscularly on 13May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0179) as the 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was the public health department. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient experienced feelings of throat closing 10 minutes after vaccine on 13May2021 at 11:45. The adverse event (AE) did result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was further reported that the throat felt like it was closing 5-10 minutes after administration and they got medical advise 30 minutes after the shot. All vitals were normal and no other symptoms. Diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) was administered. Symptoms resolved within 2 hours. The patient recovered from the event on 13May2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine and known the potential for severe allergic reactions after vaccination, a causal relationship between event &#34;throat felt like it was closing 5-10 minutes after administration&#34; and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She also had a headache and troubles breathing. She had belly pain, as well. On Wednesday, around lunch break she called me to pick her up, she had troubles breathing and headache and feeling blah. Also on the first evening,  Her arm was hurting and her left body side was hurting. (Wednesday this got a little bitter but she still had pain on her front left side -- especially her left leg.)  I took her to primary care and he prescribed Prednisone.  Prednisone started then. On Thursday, she still had troubles breathing and she stayed home from school. On Friday, it was okay for her to go to school.

I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

                                                Patient was administered the first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine per protocol and was seated for observation post administration.  She became faint.  Pharmacy staff  broke an ammonia inhalant to help the patient recover.  She responded quickly, but did require additional whiffs later.  When questioned, she stated that she was having no difficulty breathing, swelling in throat,  and no obvious rash.  She was accompanied by her mother, who  declined emergency medical care/911 assistance.  The patient was not wearing constrictive clothing, so no adjustments were necessary, but she did recline further in the chair.  She was also provided with cool, wet, paper towels for her forehead and neck.  When she was feeling better, she had a few sips of water.  Although offered a motorized cart to leave the store, she left with both parents walking with no assistance.  On 5/20/21 we reached out to the family and spoke with her father.  The patient did have a minor  headache the evening of her vaccine administration, which has resolved.  She does have a sore arm, which is a common side effect of the vaccine,  Her father has reached out to her pediatrician to see whether she should get the second dose or not.  He has not yet received a response.

                                                Pt received her 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine in the right arm at approximately 2:45 PM on May 29 at pharmacy. Pt was recommended to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting area after vaccination for observation, but she and mom opted to go shopping in the store. At approximately 3:37 PM, pt and mom came back to the pharmacy to tell me (the pharmacist) that she had hives and showed me red bumps on her left arm. I had the pt sit while mom went to go buy Benadryl. After 5 minutes, I checked on the pt. She had taken one dose of Benadryl and stated that she was dizzy and feeling itchy all over. After chatting with mom for 5-10 minutes, the pt stated that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening and were stabilizing. The pt then said she wanted to rest at home. I recommended she sit for a little longer, but mom stated she would keep a close eye on the pt and had an epipen at home. They then left the pharmacy. I followed up with mom on May 30th at approximately 4:00 PM to see how the pt was doing, and she stated that they were at the ER because the symptoms were not getting any better, and the pt &#34;felt like she was having an asthma attack.&#34; Pt&#39;s mom states that the pt is doing much better after receiving IV meds.

                                                Received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday May 16,2021 at around 2:50 pm. At around 7:20 pm on May 16,2021 she stood up to walk to the bathroom. She began feeling nauseous when she stood up. While she was washing her hands, after going to the bathroom, she began to have difficulty with her vision. She describes white and blue dots obstructing her vision in both eyes. She also began to experience loud tinnitus. She described hearing multiple frequencies.  The problem with her vision and the tinnitus continued as she walked through our house to a couch where she laid down. The vision problem and tinnitus continued while she laid on the couch. Her breathing was rapid but she thinks this may have been due to the stress caused by her other symptoms. This episode lasted for several minutes and then the vision problem resolved. The tinnitus continued for several minutes after the vision problem resolved. The intensity of the tinnitus slowly decreased until it finally stopped. The following evening, she experienced tinnitus for a few minutes but it was less intense than it was the previous evening. She very rarely has experienced tinnitus in the past. She has very infrequently experienced brief episodes of orthostatic hypotension when she was dehydrated. When this event occurred, she felt like she was well hydrated.

                                                tired; coughing; Breathing reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23May2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to amoxicillin where it was a couple of times when she was little and she would get blotches and red; and has been vaping without her parents knowing. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON). On 23May2021, the patient experienced breathing reaction. The mother stated that her daughter took the vaccine, she was 15, she was aware of the normal side effect problems and heart problems as she has been hearing in the news, she was concerned because she just figured out her daughter has been vaping without her parents knowing. The mother stated that she was a family therapist, and many teens vape age 12-15, parents don&#39;t have a clue about vaping and the chemicals in the vape that can cause heart and lung problems. She was contacting Pfizer because she wants to make sure this was in the radar, because of side effects. They should consider asking these types of things prior to administering the product. The mother was concerned watching her daughters breathing reaction. Her daughter was better today. The mother was reading side effects on vaping and there was some link to heart and lung issues, some even have lead in the chemicals or nicotine. The mother stated that she has also realized, in general when people ask if they are taking medications, especially for women they don&#39;t say anything about taking pills, or combination of pills. Her daughter experienced a Breathing reaction after the first dose. She was better today, she took the shot on Sunday, she was tired and coughing on an unspecified date but was better now. Her main concern was the age group and the Heart problems for this group. Her First Dose was on 23May2021, she was worse yesterday but today she was better. The breathing reaction started on the 23rd. Yesterday her daughter was in bed all day. Her daughter has made no physician office visit or went to the emergency room because of this. Treatment: Not to her knowledge, Unknown for breathing reaction. The mother again stated that she just wanted to express he concerns with this age group. The patient was recovering from all events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

The morning after while taking their temperature, Maddison said she couldn&#39;t see anything then fell into my arms. Her pupils quickly dilated, she made gutteral sounds while shaking slightly then lost consciousness. I couldn&#39;t see her breathing for about 15 seconds and she was confused when she came to. She couldn&#39;t hear, see or speak during the episode. We took her to the emergency room where a chest xray and ekg came back clear.

A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it. The blotchiness and chest pain resolved quickly, but the itchiness continued. Patient also complained of stomach pain, which occurred after patient&#39;s grandmother gave her a loratadine. The loratadine settled the itching down, but patient reported nausea the next morning and shortness of breath, as well. Patient received Claritin 24 Hr for the events as treatment. The outcome of the skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs and chest hurting was recovered on May-2021 and recovered for rest of the events in 2021  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.
