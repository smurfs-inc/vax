                                                Four hrs. after getting the vaccine.  My face started itching, could feel welts under the skin.  Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

                                                believed the heart rate might be a result of being nervous; Tightness of throat/throat tightness; Laboured breathing; Fast HR/high heart rate; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse, reporting for herself. A female patient of an unspecified age received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sensitivity to pollen, sensitivity to narcotics and allergic reactions to perfume, all from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received pneumonia vaccine and flu vaccine, both for immunization and experienced pain on the side. The patient also previously took cortisone to lower her immune system. It was reported that on 03Jan2021, the patient developed a slight reaction immediately after first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine which included tightness of throat along with laboured breathing with fast HR/heart rate was high (she believed it was greater than 80 BPM; her heart rate is usually in the 60&#39;s) which resolved after a few minutes. The nurse was going to give her Benadryl but did not as her signs and symptoms were resolving. She was asking for recommendations/clarifications on whether she should get the second dose given her reactions. She never had that type of reaction before. She had had sensitivity to pollen and narcotics. She read that she should not receive the second dose given her reactions but was asking for clarification. She would like to get the second dose and bought an Epi pen. Throat tightness and high heart rate didn&#39;t last for more than two minutes maximum. She visited websites and was directed not to get the second dose. She wanted to be 100% certain in regards to whether or not she should receive the second dose. Stated tightness in throat wasn&#39;t really that bad. She felt throat tightness previously when smelling perfume. Stated it wasn&#39;t anything to be frightened about. She also stated some websites said it does not matter and some websites said not to get the second dose. Also wanted to know if having the Epi Pen would help. She added that she explained reaction to the physician who advised her to get an Epi Pen for the second COVID Vaccine dose. She only had allergic reactions to pollen and perfume. Got the vaccine for Pneumonia and Flu. Did not get adverse reactions, but stated she only had pain on the side. Confirmed she has no NDC/Lot/Exp for the Pneumonia vaccine and Flu vaccine. She also got Coronavirus three months prior to receiving the COVID vaccine. She clarified that she diagnosed herself and it was the weirdest thing. She took cortisone to lower her immune system. Received first dose of COVID Vaccine on 03Jan2021. She wa due for second COVID Vaccine on 26Jan2021. She stated she is a psychologist with specialty in mental health. She believed the heart rate might be a result of being nervous. When she is nervous her heart rate goes up. Tightness of throat made her concerned. When asked about the indication, she stated that her husband works and the right thing to do was to be protected. She read she should have stopped taking Ibuprofen 10 days prior to the COVID Vaccine. She was not taking Ibuprofen any longer. Has no NDC/Lot/Exp for Ibuprofen at time of call. Confirmed she did not use the Epi Pen after the first dose of COVID Vaccine. She bought it for the second dose. The nurse who administered COVID Vaccine to the patient suggested she take Benadryl. By that time, she was feeling better. She stated it was questionable for half an hour. The outcome of the event Tightness of throat/throat tightness and fast HR/high heart rate was recovered on 03Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had medical history included sensitivity to pollen, sensitivity to narcotics and allergic reactions to perfume.  The reported events were likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and clinical course.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

Went back to bed.  6 am still hurt everywhere, short of breath (oxygen concentration at 90 and sometimes below--thankfully I had oxygen as I sleep with it).  Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

A 76-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number EL3247), intramuscular on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included COVID symptoms from 16Jan2021 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient with acute resp failure, COVID pneumonia, that developed symptoms 9 days prior to admit and ultimately received first vaccine 6 days prior to a admit, then shortly after progressed with other covid symptoms and was admitted on 25Jan2021. She decompensated while intp and was transferred to ICU for rising O2 needs, ultimately had to be intubated. Became hypotensive due to massive hamatoma 2&#39; bleeding into abd rectus muscle. Sx and IR consulted and did beside exploration of hematoma. Initially blood pressure responded but overnight continued with refractory hypotension. Maxed out vasopressin and levophed, hemodynamics deteriorated. The patient died on 02Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events death, COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal wall haematoma and abdominal wall haemorrhage cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pt passed soon after

Staff was notified as they were talking with her that  her voice sounded a little funny and thick. She also started to cough on a regular interval. As staff continued talking with her she stated her throat started to feel funny and tight. Staff notified other healthcare personal and moved her to the private  treatment area. She continued to complain of thick tongue and continued to speak different then her baseline. We elected to give 50 mg Benadryl IM. She was also placed on the ECG showing sinus rhythm with O2 stats of 100 % and her blood pressure was 149/61, After the Benadryl, she stated she started to fell somewhat better. After about 10 minutes her tongue started to swell again and when she turned her head to speak to a staff member her airway shut off due to swelling. Staff quickly turned her head back to forward she was able to breath again.  She advised that she needed to be transported and was going to get 0.3 epi IM in her left arm. She did state prior to Epi being given she was now also having trouble focusing visually. Dr arrive to assess her and agreed that she needed transported. EMS arrived and care was turned over to Huntertown EMS to transport the patient to Medical Center.

Called Covid line and spoke to a RN who recommended that I take Ibuprofen  and  not to take an antihistamine,  and  to contact my doctor in the morning.  Also to go to the ER if symptoms got worse I took Ibuprofen every 4 hours  over night and called  my  primary  care physician in the morning.  He sent me to the Urgent Care center since  the rash had persisted .  The Urgent Care  physician prescribed  Prednisone  and  Benadryl.  I  am taking antihistamines  and Ibuprofen  for relief of rash and  itching.  I will follow-up  doctor on Monday.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EW0158) via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder (Deltoid Right) on 11Apr2021 in the afternoon around 14:00 or 14:30 (at 76-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. None history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2 considered as suspect. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for sinus disorder for years as needed. She took it the day before the COVID19 injection. She hasn&#39;t taken it since before getting COVID19 injection. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She didn&#39;t have the ones on the paper. They didn&#39;t say she would have severe throwing up she almost had to call. She was choking on 12Apr2021. She was over it currently. She first threw up on Sunday evening and then was ok. On Sunday (11Apr2021 21:00) she only threw up once, but it was four intervals. Caller clarified an interval was where she would throw up then clean up and then throw up again. Then it was fine. On Monday (12Apr2021), in the evening around 9 PM she started to spin. She went to the bathroom and she was heaving and she couldn&#39;t say how many times she threw up. Her throat was so swollen and it felt like she was choking. Her throat was very raw. Her uvula was so swollen that is why she felt like she was choking. She was about to go the emergency room, but then looked it up. She did treatment that she saw online for 3 days. When she was gagging and coughing she looked up COVID19 Vaccine and it said that her throat would be swollen from severe throwing up. It made a lot of sense. She had all the symptoms listed online and it said it would get better in five days and if not seek treatment. It has gotten better. No visit for ER and Physician Office. Treatment received for all events. The outcomes of the events were resolving.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (lot number: EP7534) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), irritable bowel syndrome described as a condition where you&#39;re in the bathroom a lot, fibromyalgia, little depression, heartburn, upset stomach, heart fluttering issues, congestion spray (nasal congestion), and had part of a lung taken out. Family medical history included heart issues (dad and uncle). Concomitant medications included salbutamol (VENTOLINE [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma; venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) for little depression; pantoprazole for heartburn and upset stomach; fluticasone propionate (lot number: AA47468, expiration date: Aug2020) for congestion spray (nasal congestion); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for heart fluttering issues. The patient previously took SHINGRIX (also reported as shingles vaccine, for clarification) for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) on 25Feb2021 (age: 76 years) in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunization.

They were also taking blood every 4 hours (unknown results). The provided diagnosis was arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG (Mar2021). The events cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG, butterflies in the chest that went to quivering, A-Fib/Arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulted in emergency room visit and physician office visit and let to hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized from 2021 to an unknown date (also reported for 2 days, for clarification). It also gave her A-Fib, trouble breathing and now her heart rate is screwed up (Mar2021).

                                                she was hospitalized 2.5 days after having symptoms of a &#34;massive heart attack&#34; 2 days after the vaccine; blood clot; pain on the left side/pain so bad/ pain was so severe couldn&#39;t bent over and couldn&#39;t get up; pain was in the heart and underneath the rib; pain was in the heart and underneath the rib; had a little trouble breathing; broke out in a sweat; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell. She said she was tested the Friday before her nephew&#39;s funeral and was negative for the COVID-19 Virus. She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                One week post vaccine, caller&#39;s mother started to feel &#34;phlegm-y&#34;, coughing up clear phlegm.  The next day she was more lethargic, coughing.  Called her PCP, recommended Robitussin and Mucinex which she took.  Continued to feel worse.  No fever although she had cold sweats.  She felt a lot of GI pain, fullness, could not eat/drink.  Called PCP again by the 4th day of feeling bad.  Recommended Augmentin and she took 2 doses.  On 3/12 and 3/13, had difficulty breathing, coughing.  Called EMS on 3/14 and taken to hospital where she was treated for dehydration and pneumonia with a broad spectrum antibiotic and vancomycin, IV.  Given morphine for pain.  She tried to take a  GI cocktail which she felt like she was choking on. That evening on her BP bottomed out.  They continued to give IVFs to raise BP as fast as possible. She was unable to receive chest compressions due to aorta issue and her heart gave out and she stopped breathing on 3/14.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

She then reported shortness of breath that felt &#34;different&#34; than her usual shortness of breath so internal aid was called for. EMT staff assessed guest to find vital signs stable and able to speak full sentences. Guest reported feeling better at 12:15 and was moved by wheelchair to her ride to go home.

                                                March 12, 2021 - On Friday about 2pm, I started with a runny nose ? by Sunday afternoon it was like a faucet turned on ? running down my face. March 13 - Saturday morning, I started coughing c chest congestion, and had Phlegm rattling in my chest, started sneezing very frequently/ some diarrhea.  Otherwise, I felt fine. March 14 - Sunday morning, I started wheezing slightly, coughing more and sneezing frequently.  Felt fine.  Went shopping.  Nose ran so much in store, had to run to the store to get paper towels to catch it.  Later, when I carried a heavy bag of groceries from one car 12 feet to another, noticed I was very exhausted and had to rest about 15 minutes before driving home.  Wheezing more. Monday, March 15, I took my B/P meds at 1:00am and my blood pressure was way up x 4 (160?s/ 70?s) p58-64,  at 2:08am ? B/P was 183/92) so I took my PRN Clonidine and ate all the high Potassium foods I had in the house.   By 3:40am my B/P was 120/66 but went back up later with coughing.  I felt fine but tired. A little after 4am,  I carried a bag of apples and a bag of oranges up my stairs and was totally exhausted ? I felt the energy draining out of me, and so was out of breath I dropped the bags on the floor and  sat hyperventilating to get enough air in my lungs until I could breathe normally ? for 40 minutes -  it felt like fluid building in my lungs.  I started massaging my abdomen like crazy and coughing until it subsided ? considering whether I should go to E.R.  My breathing did get some better But I sure did not exert myself.  Just picking up my computer was taking my energy. Still coughing and getting rid of some phlegm.  This was very scary and I was on the verge of going to the E.R.   at 4:45am - I called the E.R. who said I probably could wait for a urgent care to open or talk to Dr.?s office.  My breathing was some better.  By 6:10am I was so tired I fell asleep.   At 10am my B/P was 138/77 p53.  Still very weak, coughing, wheezing, and trying to get rid of phlegm. I had no other symptoms.   I called my Dr. who got me in a urgent care in her building at 3pm.  That evening I started Postural Drainage which helped in getting rid of the phlegm.  I have continued that still. March 16 ? I ?chatted? my doctor to let her know all that was going on.  She scheduled me to see the Respiratory office in her building on the next day.  I was feeling much better ? little nasal dripping, lungs felt better,  March 17 ? Wednesday ? went to Respiratory appt but declined treatment because I felt so much better. More energy, better lungs than Tuesday, wheezing gone, less phlegm, still some coughing ? which is okay with me.  I think this is a severe enough reaction that I should not have the second dose ? which is known to be more severe than the first.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney ablation (ablation on the kidney cancer 5 years ago), kidney cancer, blood pressure, neuropathy, pain, had a urinary tract infection 19Dec2020 and they saw the cancer came back, radiologist read the CAT Scan and said the size of the tumor 1.5 to 2.4. Concomitant medications included acebutolol for blood pressure taking for years, diclofenac for neuropathy using for 10 years, oxycodone for pain taking 19 years; all ongoing, and oxycodone hydrochloride (OXYCONTIN) for pain. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Family Medical History was none. The caller stated that he was not sure if the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have given patient (his wife) COVID-19 or not. He also stated that when they received their vaccines the facility was very crowded as was the hospital when the wife was getting her blood work done so he was not sure when or where she contracted COVID-19. On 29Jan2021, patient was very busy running several errands including going to the hospital for bloodwork and a nuclear medicine injection as part of a work up for kidney ablation that the patient was supposed to have completed, patient was in the process of getting ready to have an ablation on her kidney and had the nuclear scan for her kidneys and then went to get a COVID test. After they got home, patient sat down at the computer and she started to act funny, kind of quiet and not talking which was unusual for her. So at about 1700PM the husband went in to ask her what kind of music she would like and he found her unconscious in the chair. He took her blood pressure and it was 60 over 4; with no heart rate; she was just barely breathing, he could tell by the way her mouth moved. He tried to breath for her, all of the sudden she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. He called (phone number provided) and they rushed her to the hospital, and the paramedics verified her heart was not beating and they started to do resuscitation. Then they finally pulled her out of the chair and put her on the floor and she started to breath. When they took her to the ambulance she was still not quite coherent; she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was taken to the hospital emergency room and stayed there for 12 hours and they monitored her with an EKG and only saw one spike for 6 seconds. They discharged her on 30Jan2021 afternoon and she has been totally normal 100 percent since then. Since she had been home she had been doing well and has had no other events. Added patient had never had a heart problem before. Caller stated that he was not sure if this event was related to her receiving the vaccine or not. Now they had to stay in quarantine 10 days until 08Feb2021 since the COVID test given at the hospital on 29Jan2021 night when she went in was positive. Patient was scheduled to received the second shot 18Feb2021. Outcome of events unconscious, no heart rate, pressure was 60 over 4 was recovered on 29Jan2021, events started to act funny and stopped breathing was recovered on 30Jan2021, outcome of other events was unknown. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, patient was taken to the ER and monitored for 12 hours but no admission. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

                                                Loss of voice; Asthma; her voice became extremely hoarse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included sore arm. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 (lot number: EN6198) on 23Feb2021 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn&#39;t tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn&#39;t want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn&#39;t used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn&#39;t want it to get worse. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination. The event hoarseness started on 18Mar2021 and loss of voice on 23Mar2021. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The outcome of the event hoarseness was not recovered, Loss of voice recovered on 13Apr2021 and asthma was unknown. The events hoarseness and loss of voice was reported as serious-medically significant.  Follow attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Hoarse voice and Loss of voice cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, NDC number of COVID Vaccine: 59267-1000-1; Expiry Date of COVID Vaccine: 31May2021), intramuscularly at Left Deltoid on 08Feb2021 10:30 (either 10:30AM or within that hour or prior) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety, panic disorder, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, additional Information for Other Conditions: She was oxygen Dependent, coeliac disease, allergy, Additional Information for Other Conditions: She had Medication, Environmental, and Food Allergies, central neuro hearing loss, vertigo, Allergic rhinitis, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Additional Information for Other Conditions: Esophageal Reflux, osteopenia, impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, claustrophobia, rheumatoid arthritis (she had arthritis for which she took Orencia for), history of coronary heart disease, diabetes, she would be a targeting patient, as she was an oncology patient with large granular lymphocytic leukemia she met criteria for the pandemic, as well as they put down that she was due for immunization. She had anaphylaxis to bees. With adhesive tapes she got dermatitis. With shellfish she got hives. She had a gluten sensitivity and with mango her mouth gets fuzzy. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s): her sisters had a few cancer. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received levofloxacin she had hives, with quinolones drug class she had hives, with thiopental she had hives and needed IV Decadron for it, with sertraline she has syncope, with Revatio she had an adverse event of joint and muscle pain, with ciprofloxacin she had tachycardia, with Enbrel it caused a drug induced pulmonary fibrosis granulomatosis, with Montelukast she had a headache and muscle pain, nitrofurantoin she had headache, with Symbicort it gave her hoarseness, she took Orencia for arthritis, she got the flu Vaccine in Sep2020. That was most recent. The patient had a grade 2 allergic reaction on 08Feb2021. The patient was watched after administering the vaccine on 08Feb2021 as she had background of multiple allergies and asthma. She was watched for 30 minutes in the oncology unit infusion suite. The reaction happened within 5 minutes of administration. Seriousness Criteria: Caller explained that this reaction was mild to moderate, there was a grade to intervene but at no point was she unstable, she did have a significant anxiety disorder, and so she was nervous about getting the vaccine. She was short of breathe, odd and flushed. She was physically stable, her vitals were stable and there was no angioedema. Reporter seriousness for grade 2 allergic reaction: Medically significant. The patient recovered, as a treatment they gave her IV Benadryl 50mg and IV fluids, she also had her own albuterol inhaler. In the pandemic, they are not doing nebulizers. The outcome of events allergic reaction, shortness of breath and flushed was recovered on 08Feb2021. Relatedness of drug to reaction(s)/event(s). Reaction assessed: Grade 2 allergic reaction; Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter. Method of assessment: Global Introspection. Drug result: Related. Causality: reporter stated that she did think the patient&#39;s base line anxiety played into the reaction she experienced, the reaction was aggravated by it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of grade 2 allergic reaction, short of breathe and flushed due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile. The patient&#39;s underlying allergic physique also predisposed the patient to developing the event. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                short of breath; nose bleed/lost a lot of blood/bleeding; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9263 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization, and eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); both via unspecified route of administration from unspecified date to 31Jan2021 at unknown dose and frequency for unspecified indication. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient had taken the first shot of the Pfizer shot on 26Jan2021 (Tuesday) and the patient seemed to managing it pretty well, she got short of breath one night (unspecified date) but in general, she felt okay. But several days later, 5 days later Sunday (31Jan2021), on Sunday morning she felt okay, what happened was she leaned a little bit, she bent down to wash her hands in the sink and she had a huge nose bleed, it was nothing like she ever had before, she was just wiping, spurting a lot of blood so this was 5 days. It was the morning of the 5th day and they had to call an ambulance to take her to the hospital and then she left the hospital. The patient had lost a lot of blood in the ambulance, they said they had never seen so much blood, they could not stop it, they kept giving her towels and the same thing in the hospital, in the emergency room. The patient was just bleeding over everywhere. The patient informed that for the last several years she has been having one baby aspirin and has been taking for the last few months or two, two or four Vascepa which was a fish oil supplement that can thin the blood but she has never had anything like this and they said go to her ENT, and she went up going ENT, and first time she went she would not take out the packing. The patient informed that it was too severe for her to take out the packing and, when she went back with her following time she took some of the packing and it started to bleed again and she cauterized it in a lot of places and you know would wait and do it again. And then she end up putting some kind of bandage that was going to help the blood clotting. Now, she has been subsequently going back to her and it was still in the very end of. The patient informed that she was still passing some very small blood clots, it has not even stopped. The patient informed that she was on 19 days passed already, since she had the bleed. The patient was very concerned. The patient informed that she was supposed to get her second vaccine in 2 to 3 days, Tuesday and she thought that this was the very bad experience that she had. The patient wanted to know if the aspirin and fish oil could have contributed to this, she stopped these as of 31Jan2021. The patient was talking to her daughter and her daughter has a friend whose mother lives in the same area and had her first Pfizer vaccine and had a small nose bleed right afterwards and then when she has second vaccine, she had another, a very bad. The patient informed that her daughter and a friend of hers said that a similar reaction occurred to her mother after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she had two small nasal bleeds and right afterwards, when she took the second vaccine she had a very big one, like hers, where she had to be taken to the hospital. The patient was concerned, she has been told that the response to the 2nd vaccine was stronger than the first. The patient further informed that she had no nose bleed like this before, like her husband was a physician, that she never had anything like this before, this was very serious kind of situation to happen, and this after the very first vaccine that she had. She had a very severe nosebleed, she had to go to the hospital to stop it. She was on a baby aspirin and some fish oil as well. The patient informed that she wasn&#39;t warned that this could thin her blood, that this was enough of a dose to do anything to create this deluge of bleeding.  The patient informed that she was few days out from getting her second shot and she had stopped the baby aspirin and the fish oil about three weeks ago. The patient informed that she was not going to take second. The patient wanted to know how long she was going to wait, how long she was going to test her antibody and see that she don&#39;t have any more antibodies and will go take the other brand vaccine. The patient added she was reporting that she had a terrible nosebleed and wanted to file a safety report. The patient wanted to know that if she choose not to get the 2nd vaccine, because of her worry of having this reaction again, how long would it be before she could get another vaccine; how long can she wait to get the second dose, or can she get a second dose from another manufacturer. The patient was requested to contact physician. The action taken in response to the events for eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA) and acetylsalicylic acid was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and plausible temporal association, the causality between the BNT162B2 and the event nosebleed cannot be excluded.  This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021191054 same reporter, similar drug/events, different patient

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy. Shoulder swelling started a couple day after the second shot, explained it was there or about around 13Feb2021. Her shoulder blade was puffy and tender. The swelling went into the arm and breast. Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached. That took a while to go away. The patient explained initially it was also there or about around 13Feb2021 when she noticed she was so fatigue and had the worse headache (Feb2021), she never got nauseous. Her shoulder was still swollen a week ago as of 09Apr2021. She went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and the chiropractor said shoulder was still a little swollen. She had terrible back pain in center of back on 18Feb2021. It was so much that she was afraid something else was going on. The patient stated the swelling it was ongoing up until a few days ago as of 09Apr2021. She still had puffiness around that area when went to chiropractor. For the back discomfort she went to chiropractor for adjustment. She was unsure when that discomfort went away. The achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles and legs until last week as of 09Apr2021 when she started to feel better. Her legs felt rubbery. Her muscles felt achy. She felt better as of 09Apr2021.

                                                Blood clot in lung; Shortness of breath; Felt tired; Slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6201), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right (also reported as &#34;injected intramuscularly in right arm&#34;) on 23Feb2021 13:00 (at the age of 79years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL8982) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 79years) for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (diagnosed prior to 10 years ago), respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities including diabetes, diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, and obesity (Little on the heavy side but she does not think she is obese); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure at 20 mg once daily, started at least 10 years ago. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that the patient had received the two doses, she had shortness of breath in the morning around 08:30 on 08Mar2021 and went to her doctor. They did blood work and she was put in the hospital because the doctor found out she had blood clots in her lungs (11Mar2021, 13:00). The patient was hospitalized for blood clot in lung from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021. She doesn&#39;t know if it came from the vaccine or not. She was sent home on Eliquis for 6 months to get blood clots from her lungs. She also has oxygen for when she needs it and mostly for when she is ambulatory. It was further clarified that when she went to her doctor&#39;s office, they did blood work. When they got results, they called her at home and told her that she had to call the ambulance and go the hospital in the ambulance, so she did; Ambulance to ER (hospital) on 11Mar2021. There was also a problem with the left ventricle of her heart (12 Mar2021 12:30). She stated whichever part pumps blood into the pulmonary vein, something is wrong there. She was going to have an echocardiogram to check that out again on 29Apr2021. She does not know the outcome of that yet until she gets that done. They gave her Eliquis as a blood thinner and oxygen.  She has not really needed the oxygen around the house.  But if she goes outside, she may. She took it to the grocery store with her and if she needed it, she used it.  She also had a headache after second dose on 24Feb2021 09:00. She felt tired on 24Feb2021 21:00 and stuff (as reported). The outcome of event blood clot in lung was unknown; the outcome of other events was recovering.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

                                                trouble breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 80-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249), by injection once to upper right arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for prevention. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced trouble breathing on 24Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. She got the vaccine shot last Thursday, later clarified as COVID vaccine, and she has read over the factual sheet given after the shot, she read it once quickly, will she be ok? She has difficulty breathing, one medication, she has that too, but not more often, with this she has been having it more often, she sleeps well during the night, it is just during the day. That was a severe reaction, two days ago or so, she can breathe sometime, but it&#39;s during the day, she read one dose effects say severe reaction, and it also says. she should have been given this paperwork before the vaccine, she didn&#39;t need it, she did not have an emergency, unless the second shot will be more helpful than one shot, after 3 weeks she gets another one. It says to call vaccine provider or healthcare professional if you have any effects that bother you or do not go away, how long do you wait until it doesn&#39;t go away? Why do they give the paperwork, why don&#39;t they give it at the doctor&#39;s office office before you set up an appointment to get vaccinated? Before so you can sit down and read the paperwork, she probably would not have gotten it, it says it is only only for emergency use for 16 and over, is this still a clinical trial, that information is not provided, and that burns her behind. She got the shot and 3 days later had the difficulty breathing, so she got it last Thursday, then started Sunday, Monday, into Tuesday, and it&#39;s just not. (caller did not complete sentence). Reporter email address declined. She hasn&#39;t told her doctor yet, provider&#39;s address and email address unknown. She thinks it started on Sunday, it wasn&#39;t yesterday, she thinks it was Sunday off and on, sometimes during day she can catch her breath, it may not be this or something, which is what she wants to find out, she is concerned with the idea this should not be sent out, she would not have gotten it. Has Pfizer received many calls about this, about the paperwork? It says it has not been approved, she would never have gotten it, it says only for emergencies, she doesn&#39;t have an emergency, this should have been given before the vaccination, it is probably still under clinical trial, but they are saying on TV everyone should be vaccinated, it is either up or down, yes or no, a see saw, yes they do something, then no, it&#39;s controversial, some part of paperwork says yes. Her breathing is not worse, this says it may go away in a few days, it says if it bothers you or does not go away, how long does she wait? It says severe reaction she doesn&#39;t understand, if it goes away, it doesn&#39;t bother her health, then goes away because of the vaccine inside, ok, once she got the vaccine, she had to stay in a room for 20 minutes or so, she had to stay in a room if she had a reaction. Her vaccine card says first dose, then says the hospital, she can&#39;t really read it, they write so quick. Says 11Feb2021 is her second dose She read in there, if you have an allergic reaction to other vaccines, she said no, this was her first reaction.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN9809; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic, asthma, allergy, sugar, and thyroid (disorder). The patient also stated that she has a lot of allergies. She was allergic to bees and allergic to bunch of things and many more things. She had her thyroid removed. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE, 100 ug) taken for thyroid (disorder), start and stop date were not reported; metformin (METFORMIN, 100 mg) taken for her sugar, start and stop date were not reported; hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, 12.5 pill), taken as diuretic, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported that she had a very bad reaction from the vaccine, which was 20 minutes her blood pressure went from normal to 190 and she started feeling her chest tight and couldn&#39;t breathe (all on 02Mar2021). She also had a black spot in her eyes (02Mar2021). The patient reported that the events started the minute after she got the shot. She was sent to the hospital on 02Mar2021. When she was in the hospital, her blood pressure went up to 244, it is the highest.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

The patient had known allergy to Benadryl and when she takes it she gets peripheral and facial edema, lip swelling, top and bottom, hives around her whole right eye. The patient also has an allergy to Class A antihistamines that started in her 20s. She said the allergy started with Seldane &amp; Claritin. She said she had giant hives with Claritin. She said she was told there were 2 classes of antihistamines &amp; she couldn&#39;t use the Class A antihistamines. She said she previously reported her Seldane, Claritin &amp; Benadryl allergies, saying she has facial &amp; peripheral edema. She said she only uses the Class B antihistamine Cimetidine now.

On 21Feb2021 at 14:00 (reported as about 2PM), the patient experienced &#34;Itching eyes/My eyes started itching.&#34; On 21Feb2021 at 21:00 (reported as 9PM), the patient experienced little coughing spell. The reporter considered the events swelling lips, itching eyes, multiple hives all around her right eye, and wheezing as serious medically significant. The patient further reported that she felt fine after the shot, her arm was not sore, nothing. She said her arm was fine, and she had no problems, whatsoever, after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E73246, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 14:15 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac pacemaker insertion, high blood pressure for years. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took flu shot (FLU VACCINE II) and never had a reaction to the flu shot, macrodantin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and hives. It was reported that about 15:15, injection site felt like it was on fire and then the whole arm felt like it was on fire. The patient got concerned. Her throat felt like it was going to close. Symptoms got less severe. She was fine yesterday and was fine that day. She called her doctor and was advised to put cold compresses on the arm and take Tylenol. She was ok. She read an article that stated if a person had a reaction to not have the second shot. She did not know if her reaction is severe. The second shot is due around 27Jan2021. She wanted to know what to do.  She felt fine on the day of report and was fine 2-3 hours after the onset of the hot and fiery feeling. It was scary and she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She also added that around 15:15, the injection arm felt like it was on fire. She felt flushed. Her throat felt like it would close up but never did. Everything resolved 2-3 hours after it started. Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 06Jan2021.

                                                Heart attack; Asthma attacks; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date (she has had Asthma for about 14-15 years), broke back from an unknown date (she broke her back about 3 years ago); stent placement from an unknown date (she had 2 heart stents placed about 2 years ago), and then she said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 16Mar2021. She said she would really like to know if the COVID-19 Vaccine possibly caused her to have the worse asthma attack she ever had in her life on 17Mar2021. She clarified she was talking to her friend on the telephone when she had her asthma attack at 3:30PM. She said that on 18Mar2021 at 5:00AM, she had a second asthma attack. She said her second asthma attack was not as bad as the one she had on 17Mar2021. For her first asthma attack on 17Mar2021, she took 2 puffs from her inhaler, and then an additional 2 puffs (4 puffs total). She said her doctor told her if she had a bad asthma attack, she could take 2 more puffs from the inhaler. She said she normally takes 2 puffs from her inhaler. She said for her second asthma attack on 18Mar2021 she took only 2 puffs from her inhaler. After she took her 2 puffs from her ProAir HFA Albuterol Sulfate inhaler, she flopped back into her bed. She reported she normally has 3-4 asthma attacks a year. She reported that her doctor did a complete blood workup on 03Mar2021 and told her she was doing just lovely. The patient also reported she had a very mild heart attack and she can&#39;t even take low dose aspirin. The patient also reported she had another question about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) and wanted to know if anything in the list of the COVID-19 Vaccine ingredients would indicate her having a possible allergy to the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and/or Physician Office. The outcome of the event asthma attack was recovering, and for the heart attack was unknown.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

She took 50 milligrams of Benadryl and got up and walked around.  She reports that her symptoms resolved after about 30 minutes and she went back to bed without any difficulty.  She has had a previous history of anaphylactic reaction to atenolol and chlorthalidone, which do not appear to have a cross reaction to the vaccine.  She is wondering if she should cancel her 2nd vaccine appointment and is concerned that she may not have full immunity with only 1 vaccine dose. Dr. recommends that she not receive the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                she is short of hearing; losing her breathe; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer sponsored program. An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: Stage 3 lung cancer, radioactive therapy on 25Dec2020 to 31Dec2020 (Also reported as 2-days prior to her 1st vaccine shot, the nurse gave her 2 radioactive therapy and the last one was 31Dec2020), immune therapy on 01Jan2021 (7 weeks&#39; worth received all in 7 days), and steroid therapy on December 2020 and Jan2021. The patient had terrible reaction from the immune therapy on an unspecified date which include all the skin of her mouth had ulcers, had such sickness, diarrhea, a rash all over the face, had headaches, was so fatigued, no energy and could not get out of bed. Patient felt better in the past few days. Other medical history included had a bad fall, two broken ribs and needed hip replacement surgery from unspecified dates. She lives alone and received 700 units a day of steroids for 10-days last December.  Family history included lung cancer runs in her family (sister and brother died of lung cancer, other sister got it too).  Patient stated her doctor called her in 2 days before and stated her next step was immune therapy, she has had massive doses of radioactive before, she had 7 weeks of that in 10 days, and had an extreme reaction from that, the last one was 31Dec2020. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated she refused her immune therapy, as she wanted the vaccine. It was put down as she did not want it. The patient reported that nurse there then said she was going to be put on unspecified steroid, which she never had before. Her friend picked up the prescription and, without reading everything, and she usually does, she took two of them. It said take all 6 that evening, but she took 2 then read and it said not to take with any vaccine. She stated that the nurse knew how she stressed she wanted the vaccine, and so she had the COVID vaccine. She just had the two steroids, and she said she wanted to wait until Mar2021 until she considered getting immune therapy, but the nurse booked her for 26Feb2021, and she had her second vaccine from Pfizer scheduled on 19Feb2021 one week apart. She asked if that is too soon, and does she need to put off immune therapy again. She read it is 2-3 weeks between, she wanted to have this verified. Patient stated she supposed to take 6 steroids then 5 and so on. She took 2 pills then as she was reading information regarding the vaccine, she did not take anymore.  Last week is when she took the two steroids, she won&#39;t take them. She called a pharmacist, who said do not take them. The doctor&#39;s office, the nurse, gave them, after she told them she would have the vaccine. She stated she was furious, but she was getting this all the way down the line. She put the steroids away, she said she was not taking them, she talked to someone in the medical field and told her how she felt, and she agreed.  Patient asked if it will be ok to have the immune therapy at that time and soon after getting the vaccine if it would be effective. She mentioned that at her age she is more concerned that she gets that vaccine and she wants to delay having the immune therapy until March given the horrible reaction she had before. She tried and tried to have this conversation with her doctors, but she does not have all that technology and they are only offering remote appointments. Patient stated that she had no problems from the first dose of the vaccine stating she did not even feel the needle. She has been exactly an hour on the phone. The patient stated that she was losing her breathe after speaking at this time during the call on 05Feb2021. She also stated she is short of hearing (onset date unknown). Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Feb2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included right partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the remote past, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, morbid obesity, motion sickness, unspecified allergy as the patient cannot tolerate anything but paracetamol (TYLENOL), acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) tablet, meclizine hcl tablet for motion relief and hydrochlorothiazide/ triamterene (DYAZIDE) capsule. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) in the left arm and experienced difficulty breathing, ground glass opaque lung problem, weak, nausea, &#34;pain on rt.side waist around to back, down to lower belly&#34;, slight temp almost 100. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and inability to eat for two days. The patient reportedly received the second dose of BNT162B2 four days prior to coming to the emergency room (ER). In the ER, the patient reported severe asthenia, mild upper abdominal pain and dysphagia, all as of an unspecified date. The patient underwent a CTA in the ER, on Feb2021, which showed no acute pulmonary embolism, or no ground glass infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 21Feb2021 at 17:51 for management of worsening shortness of breath. Due to the patient&#39;s acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema and obesity, hypoventilation (as of an unspecified date in Feb2021) was further complicated by obstructive sleep apnea, thus, the patient was admitted to &#34;MedSurg&#34;. The patient did not present with COVID-19 or COPD. The BMP was 226 at the time of admission. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen and additionally started on CPAP at night. She was seen by a pulmonologist who recommended Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR). Pulmonology also recommended to work-up any underlying unaddressed coronary artery disease contributing to the patient&#39;s shortness of breath. The patient underwent an echocardiogram on Feb2021 with regadenoson (LEXISCAN) for her shortness of breath which was within normal limits. As the patient additionally reported dysphagia at the time of admission, she was evaluated by a speech and swallow evaluation specialist as well as a gastroenterologist. A GI swallow series was recommended which the patient underwent on Feb2021 and was found to have no active signs of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. The patient additionally underwent a physical exam on 24Feb2021 at 08:00 with the following results. Vital signs: Temp: 98.2, Pulse: 69, Resp: 17, B/P (MAP): 98/62 (74), Pulse Ox: 96, O2 Delivery: Nasal cannula, O2 flow rate:2.00. HEENT: Pupils equal round reactive light accommodation, no lymphadenopathy noted, neck vens were apple. CVS: S1-S2 normal, no appreciable murmur rub or gallop noted. Respiratory: Good Inspiratory effort, good air entry bilaterally, no rhonchi, Rales or wheezes heard. Gl: Abdomen soft, nontender nondistended, bowel sounds heard, no organomegaly detected. Extremities: Bilateral lower extremities Shaw no edema, bilateral dorsalis pedis 2&#43;, skin appeared intact. Neurological: Patient alert and oriented x3, strength 5x5 in all 4 extremities, no signs of focal neurological deficits. Skin: No clear breakdown or rashes noted. The patient was being discharged home on 24Feb2021 at 08:04 with a CPAP machine. The patient was prescribed Cefuroxime axetil (CEFTIN) 250mg Tablet orally twice a day; Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR) 250-50 diskus 1 puff twice a day for progressive shortness of breath and hypoventilation. The patient had been advised to follow-up with a pulmonologist for an outpatient pulmonary function test. The clinical outcome of progressive shortness of breath, hypoventilation, inability to eat, dysphagia, severe asthenia and mild upper abdominal pain was unknown. The reporting physician considered that BNT162B2 had no causal effect on the events reported.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: In agreement with the HCP reporter, the reported events  do not appear to be related to the subject vaccine. The events likely represent intercurrent medical conditions, possibly associated with the patient&#39;s history of  emphysema. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.

The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

An 83-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE),  via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose (at the age of 83-years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included the patient had known allergies (unspecified) and unspecified chronic health conditions from an unknown date.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient was not pregnant. The patient received unspecified concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 15Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough. The events resulted in emergency room visit and the patient was hospitalized (from an unknown date) for the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough for 6 days. The clinical course is as follows: 2 or 3 weeks after the patient got the vaccine she started getting out of breath when she walked. Each day she got worse. Then the patient was taken to the hospital where they discovered the patient had three blood clots. The clots were in the patient&#39;s leg, heart and lung. The patient stated the Doctors do not understand where the clots came from. The patient was in the hospital 6 days. The patient stated they are still having breathing problem and still on oxygen as needed and they still cough at night. The patient asked if there have been any other reports of this happening to other people who got the vaccine as the patient never had blood clots before this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (nasal swab): negative on 15Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough and included blood thinners and oxygen therapy and complete bed rest. The clinical outcome of the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

                                                The patient received her covid 19 Pfizer vaccine on 2/25./21. Later that day her daughter went to her home to check on her. Upon arriving, she found that her mother&#39;s skin was red and itchy, her face was swollen, and she was having trouble breathing. The patient was taken to the hospital thereafter. Her primary care physician is aware and does not want the patient receiving the second dose.

                                                3/13/21 Ferrell ER to admission hpi: 84 y.o. female presented to the emergency room with complaints of back pain, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

                                                suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now; shortness of breath; hoarse/ hoarseness; audible wheezing; doesn&#39;t have the energy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 84-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2019 and ongoing, when she would sleep her oxygen would drop, and shrunk from 5 feet 5 1/4 inches to now 5 feet 2 inches. She never found out why her oxygen saturations dropped at night but she does not have sleep apnea. Her saturations would drop down to the 80s and she would still be sleeping. Concomitant medications included ongoing albuterol [salbutamol] taken for asthma and oxygen taken for &#34;when she would sleep her oxygen would drop&#34; from 2012 and ongoing. Patient previously took Anoro and Qvar in Aug2019. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 25Feb2021 (lot number: EN6206, NDC:59267-1000-01, Expiry date unknown) in the left arm. With the first vaccine she did not have any symptoms, she thought she got saline. Only symptoms she felt were when they told her to wait 15 minutes and she sat there and when she got up and she was driving and had her window down her nose felt like it was swelling. She lost her sense of smell due to an injury and she had an acute sense of smell of tobacco from the car next to her. That is the only symptom she had. The acute sense of smell was about 30 minutes after she got her injection, about 5-7 minutes after that. She left about 10:30 am and it happened around 10:35-10:37 am. The acute sense of smell was short lived, it happened for a minute or two. Several years ago she had shoulder surgery and had her great granddaughter and she was playing with her and her foot got caught in the coffee table and she fell and her nose got cut and lost her sense of smell. When asked for seriousness criteria, patient stated it was significant because she had not been able to smell since 2011 and she had the sensation of her nose swelling. She felt like that but she was driving and could not look at her nose. She didn&#39;t have the feeling 15 minutes after the vaccine, she had been driving for 5-7 minutes and had the feeling and it was exactly when she got in the car. It was significant because she was able to smell something. Patient had her second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Mar2021 and had shortness of breath. She suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now. She did not seem to be getting better and the slightest movement, she&#39;s short of breath. She is taking the medicine that she normally takes but never had to take it this much. She was short of breath and not paying that much attention to it, when she goes out she wears a mask, since last year, and she went to put the trash out and had shortness of breath stepping out the back door. She was talking to a friend long distance and she told her she was so short of breath. To get out of bed and turn in bed she&#39;s more short of breath. The shortness of breath may have started before Friday 26Mar2021 but that&#39;s when she noticed it. She would have her mask on, park her car and go to the post office and when she would walk to her PO box, which is the first of the boxes, she was exhausted and not getting enough air and she noticed it. But then when she went outside to put the trash out, just a step outside she was short of breath, that&#39;s when she began to notice. She has never been this short of breath and her breathing and exchange of air has never been this bad. She thought she would maybe get her smell back and in all the years she&#39;s been diagnosed with asthma she&#39;s never had the wheezing and shortness of breath that she&#39;s had now. She&#39;s never heard herself wheeze. Monday night she was up at 3 am and got up to go to the bathroom and she was so short of breath. She had to take it at 3:30 am and that had never happened to her. She never had wheezing until the second vaccine. She doesn&#39;t need a stethoscope to hear the wheezing and that most people have asthma with wheezing but she did not. Patient was not taking the Qvar until after the second dose of the vaccine and was only using the albuterol before. She would take two puffs in her car and then put two masks before getting out. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No AE required a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was scheduled to see her primary doctor on 13Apr2021 but could not get in earlier and attempted to see her pulmonary doctor and the earliest she can is 07Apr2021 and she has that appointment. Patient was also very hoarse. From time to time medications like her inhaler for her asthma sometimes makes her hoarse. This time she has the hoarseness even when she doesn&#39;t take her inhaler. She has audible wheezing. She would not consider the shortness of breath life threatening but it is concerning because she is not able to do what she needs to do because she doesn&#39;t have the energy. Hoarseness is worsening because she is taking more of the medications she&#39;s normally taking and now she is taking the inhaler twice a day because she is more short of breath. The one inhaler she is using is Qvar. She has been taking the albuterol more also. Hoarseness is not life threatening, it is effective but it is not disabling. The more she talks, the more hoarse she gets. Relatedness of drug to reactions shortness of breath, very hoarse, by primary source reporter (Method of assessment: Global Introspection) was related. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Asthma aggravated and Shortness of breath cannot be excluded. Medical history of asthma may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

I then directed her son to wheel her back to a room and the charge nurse grabbed the Oxygen for us.  We took a pulse on room air and she was bouncing around 84-85%.    At this point she began to have uncontrolled jerking movements in her neck, upper and lower extremities.  She was talking during these and never lost consciousness.  When the shaking started I had the nurse call 911 to get EMS on the way.    She then had her O2 by nasal canula placed and it was turned up to 6L to start until O2 came up to 98%.  We then slowly turned town to 3L and maintained SpO2 around 97%.  Involuntary muscle jerking continued although it was a little less severe.  EMS came and transferred her to the ER.

                                                My mother had an &#34;adverse event&#34; to the first dose of the Covid-19 PFIZER  mRNA vaccine. Her whole upper arm became swollen (inflammation) and somewhat &#34;hot to the touch&#34; and was reddish in coloring. The inflammation did NOT look like a golf ball, but rather like a small hill on her upper arm, with a slope. After that, she reported to me .... that she was getting &#34;winded&#34;, on walks with her best friend. They both live in a senior citizen residence center, which is NOT an &#34;assisted living&#34; facility. Now, the swelling (inflammation) is gone. My mother has now had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and yesterday .... she did NOT report, any adverse reactions (yet) from her second injection.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number and expiration date unknown, first dose, intramuscular on 26Jan2021 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mastectomy, surgery for metaplastic carcinoma. She received 4 units of blood and reacted to the blood and itched from her head to toe and they treated her with prednisone for that. She said that the metaplastic carcinoma was 10 inches big and half of her front was removed. Other medical history and past drugs included allergic to Bactrim, Sulfa drugs, Cortisone, Zocor, Keflex, Macrodantin, Penicillin, Vicodin (took three times and thought she was going to die; coughed for a year and couldn&#39;t even sleep because she developed Pericarditis), Benazepril, Levaquin, Losartan, Niaspan (whole body turned red), Pravastatin. On 07Jan2021, she had an appointment with her doctor who first advised her not to take the vaccine because of all of her allergies but she said there is an antidote if she has a reaction so she said she could take it. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Jan2021 and had a bad reaction. She was very dizzy and got sick. They didn&#39;t catch it at the vaccination site because they only had the patients wait 15 minutes. Her drive home takes 10-15 minutes. She thought she couldn&#39;t drive home because of the dizziness. She got a tightness in her chest and started getting so dizzy that she ran into the living room and slept on the sofa because she couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. It was reported that she passed out from about 12:00-15:00. She was completely out. She took a Tylenol right after the shot for dizziness and sick because when she told her healthcare professional about the symptoms, she said to take a Tylenol. She also had shortness of breath on 27Jan2021. This morning (28Jan2021) she had a headache but she was feeling much better. The caller asked if she should get the second dose due to her reaction. The patient stated she has a whole list of allergies that she gave the other agent. The patient stated that she doesn&#39;t think she will take the second shot. She also stated she takes Tylenol after the Flu shot so she doesn&#39;t get so sick. The patient mentioned that her physician does not know about any of this and said that she received the vaccine at a hospital. She said that she only contacted her doctor to notify her that she was dizzy. She was directed to take Tylenol. She said that she did take Tylenol as directed by the people administering the vaccines too and she did get sick. The patient said that it helped a little and she knows that it was not the Tylenol that caused this. She does not want to get the second shot if she gets sick like this. The patient said that the fact sheet said to call 911. The shot did not hurt her at all, and she did not know that she even received it. She said that the person who administered the vaccine was very good. The outcome of the event headache was recovering, dizziness, shortness of breath recovered on 27Jan2021, Tightness in her chest, passed out was recovered on 26Jan2021 and sick was unknown.
