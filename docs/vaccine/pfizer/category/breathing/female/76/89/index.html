                                                Four hrs. after getting the vaccine.  My face started itching, could feel welts under the skin.  Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

                                                believed the heart rate might be a result of being nervous; Tightness of throat/throat tightness; Laboured breathing; Fast HR/high heart rate; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse, reporting for herself. A female patient of an unspecified age received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sensitivity to pollen, sensitivity to narcotics and allergic reactions to perfume, all from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received pneumonia vaccine and flu vaccine, both for immunization and experienced pain on the side. The patient also previously took cortisone to lower her immune system. It was reported that on 03Jan2021, the patient developed a slight reaction immediately after first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine which included tightness of throat along with laboured breathing with fast HR/heart rate was high (she believed it was greater than 80 BPM; her heart rate is usually in the 60&#39;s) which resolved after a few minutes. The nurse was going to give her Benadryl but did not as her signs and symptoms were resolving. She was asking for recommendations/clarifications on whether she should get the second dose given her reactions. She never had that type of reaction before. She had had sensitivity to pollen and narcotics. She read that she should not receive the second dose given her reactions but was asking for clarification. She would like to get the second dose and bought an Epi pen. Throat tightness and high heart rate didn&#39;t last for more than two minutes maximum. She visited websites and was directed not to get the second dose. She wanted to be 100% certain in regards to whether or not she should receive the second dose. Stated tightness in throat wasn&#39;t really that bad. She felt throat tightness previously when smelling perfume. Stated it wasn&#39;t anything to be frightened about. She also stated some websites said it does not matter and some websites said not to get the second dose. Also wanted to know if having the Epi Pen would help. She added that she explained reaction to the physician who advised her to get an Epi Pen for the second COVID Vaccine dose. She only had allergic reactions to pollen and perfume. Got the vaccine for Pneumonia and Flu. Did not get adverse reactions, but stated she only had pain on the side. Confirmed she has no NDC/Lot/Exp for the Pneumonia vaccine and Flu vaccine. She also got Coronavirus three months prior to receiving the COVID vaccine. She clarified that she diagnosed herself and it was the weirdest thing. She took cortisone to lower her immune system. Received first dose of COVID Vaccine on 03Jan2021. She wa due for second COVID Vaccine on 26Jan2021. She stated she is a psychologist with specialty in mental health. She believed the heart rate might be a result of being nervous. When she is nervous her heart rate goes up. Tightness of throat made her concerned. When asked about the indication, she stated that her husband works and the right thing to do was to be protected. She read she should have stopped taking Ibuprofen 10 days prior to the COVID Vaccine. She was not taking Ibuprofen any longer. Has no NDC/Lot/Exp for Ibuprofen at time of call. Confirmed she did not use the Epi Pen after the first dose of COVID Vaccine. She bought it for the second dose. The nurse who administered COVID Vaccine to the patient suggested she take Benadryl. By that time, she was feeling better. She stated it was questionable for half an hour. The outcome of the event Tightness of throat/throat tightness and fast HR/high heart rate was recovered on 03Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had medical history included sensitivity to pollen, sensitivity to narcotics and allergic reactions to perfume.  The reported events were likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and clinical course.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Went back to bed.  6 am still hurt everywhere, short of breath (oxygen concentration at 90 and sometimes below--thankfully I had oxygen as I sleep with it).  Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

A 76-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number EL3247), intramuscular on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included COVID symptoms from 16Jan2021 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient with acute resp failure, COVID pneumonia, that developed symptoms 9 days prior to admit and ultimately received first vaccine 6 days prior to a admit, then shortly after progressed with other covid symptoms and was admitted on 25Jan2021. She decompensated while intp and was transferred to ICU for rising O2 needs, ultimately had to be intubated. Became hypotensive due to massive hamatoma 2&#39; bleeding into abd rectus muscle. Sx and IR consulted and did beside exploration of hematoma. Initially blood pressure responded but overnight continued with refractory hypotension. Maxed out vasopressin and levophed, hemodynamics deteriorated. The patient died on 02Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events death, COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal wall haematoma and abdominal wall haemorrhage cannot be excluded.

Staff was notified as they were talking with her that  her voice sounded a little funny and thick. She also started to cough on a regular interval. As staff continued talking with her she stated her throat started to feel funny and tight. Staff notified other healthcare personal and moved her to the private  treatment area. She continued to complain of thick tongue and continued to speak different then her baseline. We elected to give 50 mg Benadryl IM. She was also placed on the ECG showing sinus rhythm with O2 stats of 100 % and her blood pressure was 149/61, After the Benadryl, she stated she started to fell somewhat better. After about 10 minutes her tongue started to swell again and when she turned her head to speak to a staff member her airway shut off due to swelling. Staff quickly turned her head back to forward she was able to breath again.  She advised that she needed to be transported and was going to get 0.3 epi IM in her left arm. She did state prior to Epi being given she was now also having trouble focusing visually. Dr arrive to assess her and agreed that she needed transported. EMS arrived and care was turned over to Huntertown EMS to transport the patient to Medical Center.

Called Covid line and spoke to a RN who recommended that I take Ibuprofen  and  not to take an antihistamine,  and  to contact my doctor in the morning.  Also to go to the ER if symptoms got worse I took Ibuprofen every 4 hours  over night and called  my  primary  care physician in the morning.  He sent me to the Urgent Care center since  the rash had persisted .  The Urgent Care  physician prescribed  Prednisone  and  Benadryl.  I  am taking antihistamines  and Ibuprofen  for relief of rash and  itching.  I will follow-up  doctor on Monday.

On Tues. his job told him to get a COVID test. He went in Wed. and the rapid test was positive.  I went down hill.  I had headache, chills, sore all over, sore throat, coughing, shortness of breath, sore tongue, diarrhea, didn&#39;t have fever.  Was up Thursday night because of shortness of breath. Called Doctors office and was told to go to walk in clinic and someone would come out and get me.  Was seen by PA I think. Not a doctor. They only did a rapid test and it was negative. She didn&#39;t do the second test and send it off. I have found two people who had the rapid rest and results were negative that the results s Results sent in from second test came back positive. She prescribed Prednisone  which helped.  I was sick for over two weeks and still struggling with fatigue, aching , sore throat and shortness of breath.

                                                On 2/16, a few hours after the second shot, I started to feel exhausted. For 2 days I slept about 17 hours total. When I got up, I coughed nonstop and wheezed. Codeine cough syrup did nothing. On Mar 5, I was no better, so I went to Urgent Care. They said I had an exacerbation of COPD, but I have never had COPD. They prescribed erythromycin, prednisone, and a Wixela inhaler. On Mar 15, my PCP, Dr. put me back on prednisone for 10 days and added 2 OTC asthma meds. Within 10 days I was much better. On Apr 5, I had some breathing tests that were normal.  I saw pulmonologist Dr. on 4/16. He said it might have been a vaccine reaction. I have never experienced anything like this before.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EW0158) via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder (Deltoid Right) on 11Apr2021 in the afternoon around 14:00 or 14:30 (at 76-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. None history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2 considered as suspect. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for sinus disorder for years as needed. She took it the day before the COVID19 injection. She hasn&#39;t taken it since before getting COVID19 injection. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She didn&#39;t have the ones on the paper. They didn&#39;t say she would have severe throwing up she almost had to call. She was choking on 12Apr2021. She was over it currently. She first threw up on Sunday evening and then was ok. On Sunday (11Apr2021 21:00) she only threw up once, but it was four intervals. Caller clarified an interval was where she would throw up then clean up and then throw up again. Then it was fine. On Monday (12Apr2021), in the evening around 9 PM she started to spin. She went to the bathroom and she was heaving and she couldn&#39;t say how many times she threw up. Her throat was so swollen and it felt like she was choking. Her throat was very raw. Her uvula was so swollen that is why she felt like she was choking. She was about to go the emergency room, but then looked it up. She did treatment that she saw online for 3 days. When she was gagging and coughing she looked up COVID19 Vaccine and it said that her throat would be swollen from severe throwing up. It made a lot of sense. She had all the symptoms listed online and it said it would get better in five days and if not seek treatment. It has gotten better. No visit for ER and Physician Office. Treatment received for all events. The outcomes of the events were resolving.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (lot number: EP7534) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), irritable bowel syndrome described as a condition where you&#39;re in the bathroom a lot, fibromyalgia, little depression, heartburn, upset stomach, heart fluttering issues, congestion spray (nasal congestion), and had part of a lung taken out. Family medical history included heart issues (dad and uncle). Concomitant medications included salbutamol (VENTOLINE [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma; venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) for little depression; pantoprazole for heartburn and upset stomach; fluticasone propionate (lot number: AA47468, expiration date: Aug2020) for congestion spray (nasal congestion); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for heart fluttering issues. The patient previously took SHINGRIX (also reported as shingles vaccine, for clarification) for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) on 25Feb2021 (age: 76 years) in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunization. On 18Mar2021, right after taking the vaccine, patient started to experience quivering inside. Initially it felt like butterflies in the chest and then to quivering, it was then quivering the whole week. She knew she was going in for a test , an endoscopy, where they go down the throat.

They said they might have to shock her heart or something. They wanted her to see the cardiologist right away. From the ER, she had 2 IVs, 1 in each arm. They were also taking blood every 4 hours (unknown results). The provided diagnosis was arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG (Mar2021). The events cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG, butterflies in the chest that went to quivering, A-Fib/Arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulted in emergency room visit and physician office visit and let to hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized from 2021 to an unknown date (also reported for 2 days, for clarification). It also gave her A-Fib, trouble breathing and now her heart rate is screwed up (Mar2021). On an unspecified date in 2021, she feels so weak and has irregular heartbeat. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included Eliquis, Atorvastatin, Diltiazem, and other unspecified medications. The outcome of cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG, butterflies in the chest that went to quivering, arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, she feels so weak was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.

Patient is being seen in the emergency department for evaluation of the above, here with her daughter.  Patient was seen and evaluated by local urgent care and referred here for evaluation.  Is reported that patient was hypoxic.  Patient&#39;s daughter also states that they have been monitoring her oxygen saturation at home and it has been in the 60s and 80%.  Patient does report a cough.  She has been using her inhaler more frequently.  Received her Covid vaccination 2 days ago.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted and placed on supplemental O2.  Chest x-ray 4/15/2021 showed some opacity at the left costophrenic angle effusion with some areas of atelectasis possible.  Chest CT performed on 4/16/2021 revealed small areas of consolidation/infiltrate in the right upper and left lower lobes of the lungs, emphysema, and a 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since CT of12/11/2020.  Initial CBC revealed white blood cell count of 9.3.  Hemoglobin and hematocrit were stable at 8.8 and 29.4.  Renal function was stable as well.  Glucose on 4/16/2021 fasting was 222.  Magnesium was at goal at 2.5.  Procalcitonin levels were performed and were 0.19.  She was initially started on IV vancomycin and cefepime as well as Flagyl due to possible aspiration pneumonia.   On 4/17/2021, patient was adamant on being discharged.  She did discuss possibly signing out AMA.  I did explain to her the ramifications of that.  She voiced understanding.  I also discussed this with her daughter, as well.  She required 4 L of supplemental O2 and achieved an O2 sat of 93%.  On room air patient was 78%.  Therefore, home O2 was ordered.  IV antibiotics were changed to oral Levaquin 250 mg to take 1 by mouth daily (based on renal function) for 7 days and generic Flagyl 500 mg to take 1 3 times a day for 7 days.  She was instructed to take antibiotics as prescribed as well as use supplemental O2.  She was also advised that if symptoms worsened she was to return to the emergency room.   At time of discharge she was stable with supplemental O2 in place.  ED to Hosp-Admission Discharged  4/28/2021 - 5/4/2021 (6 days)    Last attending ? Treatment team    Hospital Course     HPI:  a 76 y.o. female with a past medical history of systolic and diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, above-the-knee amputation of left lower extremity, who comes from home where her oxygen saturation as per the daughter was 25%.  She was recently discharged from here on 4/17/2021 for left lower lobe pneumonia.  She does not want to be in the hospital.  She states that she felt fine when she came in this time.  She was evaluated by the ICU who stated she is a DNR/DNI and felt that with BiPAP modification she was satting better.  She was adamant that she wanted to leave the last time she was here and went home with oral Levaquin and Flagyl.  When she arrived, nursing states that there was dried stool on her bottom.  The patient denies any current shortness of breath.  She wants her BiPAP mask removed as it is uncomfortable to her.  After explaining it as needed she agreed to have it on.  She denies any abdominal pain, she denies any chest pain.  She denies any fevers or chills.   Hospital Course:   Patient was admitted for acute on chronic diastolic CHF, acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to CHF and COVID-19.  Patient was also treated for elevated blood pressures.  Cardiology was consulted, patient was placed on Lasix twice daily and was started on hydralazine for blood pressure.  From pneumonia standpoint, patient started on Zosyn, for COVID-19 patient was started on Decadron and remdesivir.  Patient finished a course of remdesivir in the hospital.  Patient went from using 5 L oxygen to only 1 L, meanwhile chronically she has been using 3 L at home prior to coming into the hospital.  Patient has not been requiring any further BiPAP.  She has been afebrile for more than 48 hours.  Today nephrology recommended to lower Lasix down to once daily instead of twice daily to avoid kidney injury.  Patient is medically stable for discharging home today to finish her course of Augmentin and Decadron.  Patient appears to be very hesitant about having to continue self isolating.  Family understands the need for further isolation.  Patient will receive a remote monitoring kit upon discharge. ED to Hosp-Admission Discharged  5/10/2021 - 5/17/2021 (7 days)    Last attending ?

                                                Almost immediately after receiving the first Pfizer vaccine my throat began to constrict, my heart started pumping and I was having a hard time breathing.  I walked over the the EMT nearby who took my blood pressure which was 188/120.  He asked me if I had forgotten to take my BP meds and I responded, I take no meds.  He told me to take a seat while he took notes.  A few minutes later he took my BP again and it was the same.  He gave me a benedryl and a glass of water.  The swelling in my throat receded somewhat.  He watched me for the next 30 minutes then took my BP again which was 177/120.  Feeling somewhat better, I  waited another 30 minutes and asked the EMT if I could go home.  He took my BP again which was the same and asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital.  I said NO.  I told him I have a BP cuff at home and would monitor my BP which was normal after 3 days.  Needless to say, I have been frightened to get my second shot.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell.

She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                Have WPW with no complications until 03/12/2012 . I was taken to hospital after experiencing heavy chest and hard to breathe.  I was released on 03/13/2021 after heart settled down. Only thing I can say is this episode came on quite differently than other episodes of WPW.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                March 12, 2021 - On Friday about 2pm, I started with a runny nose ? by Sunday afternoon it was like a faucet turned on ? running down my face. March 13 - Saturday morning, I started coughing c chest congestion, and had Phlegm rattling in my chest, started sneezing very frequently/ some diarrhea.  Otherwise, I felt fine. March 14 - Sunday morning, I started wheezing slightly, coughing more and sneezing frequently.  Felt fine.  Went shopping.  Nose ran so much in store, had to run to the store to get paper towels to catch it.  Later, when I carried a heavy bag of groceries from one car 12 feet to another, noticed I was very exhausted and had to rest about 15 minutes before driving home.  Wheezing more. Monday, March 15, I took my B/P meds at 1:00am and my blood pressure was way up x 4 (160?s/ 70?s) p58-64,  at 2:08am ? B/P was 183/92) so I took my PRN Clonidine and ate all the high Potassium foods I had in the house.   By 3:40am my B/P was 120/66 but went back up later with coughing.  I felt fine but tired. A little after 4am,  I carried a bag of apples and a bag of oranges up my stairs and was totally exhausted ? I felt the energy draining out of me, and so was out of breath I dropped the bags on the floor and  sat hyperventilating to get enough air in my lungs until I could breathe normally ? for 40 minutes -  it felt like fluid building in my lungs.  I started massaging my abdomen like crazy and coughing until it subsided ? considering whether I should go to E.R.  My breathing did get some better But I sure did not exert myself.  Just picking up my computer was taking my energy. Still coughing and getting rid of some phlegm.  This was very scary and I was on the verge of going to the E.R.   at 4:45am - I called the E.R. who said I probably could wait for a urgent care to open or talk to Dr.?s office.  My breathing was some better.  By 6:10am I was so tired I fell asleep.   At 10am my B/P was 138/77 p53.  Still very weak, coughing, wheezing, and trying to get rid of phlegm. I had no other symptoms.   I called my Dr. who got me in a urgent care in her building at 3pm.  That evening I started Postural Drainage which helped in getting rid of the phlegm.  I have continued that still. March 16 ? I ?chatted? my doctor to let her know all that was going on.  She scheduled me to see the Respiratory office in her building on the next day.  I was feeling much better ? little nasal dripping, lungs felt better,  March 17 ? Wednesday ? went to Respiratory appt but declined treatment because I felt so much better. More energy, better lungs than Tuesday, wheezing gone, less phlegm, still some coughing ? which is okay with me.  I think this is a severe enough reaction that I should not have the second dose ? which is known to be more severe than the first.

                                                I am 77.  I had the Pfizer vaccine, March 9th,  with a terrible reaction starting 2 days after.  I couldn&#39;t use my brain to think, to read with comprehension, to remember things I wanted to remember and had difficulty finding my words. This lasted for 3 days when the fog began to lift.  I also had some shortness of breath(SOB)  and very low energy.  The CDC has said that when giving the injection it is no longer necessary to aspirate (pull back on the syringe) which I was taught to do as a young nurse to ensure that you are not giving the injection into a vein (blood would appear in the syringe.) It is supposed to be given into the muscle which has plenty of veins so if you don&#39;t aspirate, how will you know if you are injecting into a vein? A week later, I ended up going to the local hospital ER because of the SOB and had Chest xray, EKG, brain Cat Scan and blood work which were all normal. I debated about getting the second shot but decided to get it as long as the injector gave the injection as I had been taught. Fortunately she was very experienced and agreed to inject me using the pullback method after I explained what I had gone through the 1st time. So for the second shot I had the sore arm but no other reaction. I think Dr is making a mistake about the pullback decision.  Do we even know what happens if the vaccine is injected into a vein? I am not certain if my first shot was injected into a vein because the injector never pulled back to check.  I have not heard of anyone else with my experience.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney ablation (ablation on the kidney cancer 5 years ago), kidney cancer, blood pressure, neuropathy, pain, had a urinary tract infection 19Dec2020 and they saw the cancer came back, radiologist read the CAT Scan and said the size of the tumor 1.5 to 2.4. Concomitant medications included acebutolol for blood pressure taking for years, diclofenac for neuropathy using for 10 years, oxycodone for pain taking 19 years; all ongoing, and oxycodone hydrochloride (OXYCONTIN) for pain. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Family Medical History was none. The caller stated that he was not sure if the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have given patient (his wife) COVID-19 or not. He also stated that when they received their vaccines the facility was very crowded as was the hospital when the wife was getting her blood work done so he was not sure when or where she contracted COVID-19. On 29Jan2021, patient was very busy running several errands including going to the hospital for bloodwork and a nuclear medicine injection as part of a work up for kidney ablation that the patient was supposed to have completed, patient was in the process of getting ready to have an ablation on her kidney and had the nuclear scan for her kidneys and then went to get a COVID test. After they got home, patient sat down at the computer and she started to act funny, kind of quiet and not talking which was unusual for her. So at about 1700PM the husband went in to ask her what kind of music she would like and he found her unconscious in the chair. He took her blood pressure and it was 60 over 4; with no heart rate; she was just barely breathing, he could tell by the way her mouth moved. He tried to breath for her, all of the sudden she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. He called (phone number provided) and they rushed her to the hospital, and the paramedics verified her heart was not beating and they started to do resuscitation. Then they finally pulled her out of the chair and put her on the floor and she started to breath. When they took her to the ambulance she was still not quite coherent; she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was taken to the hospital emergency room and stayed there for 12 hours and they monitored her with an EKG and only saw one spike for 6 seconds. They discharged her on 30Jan2021 afternoon and she has been totally normal 100 percent since then. Since she had been home she had been doing well and has had no other events. Added patient had never had a heart problem before. Caller stated that he was not sure if this event was related to her receiving the vaccine or not. Now they had to stay in quarantine 10 days until 08Feb2021 since the COVID test given at the hospital on 29Jan2021 night when she went in was positive. Patient was scheduled to received the second shot 18Feb2021. Outcome of events unconscious, no heart rate, pressure was 60 over 4 was recovered on 29Jan2021, events started to act funny and stopped breathing was recovered on 30Jan2021, outcome of other events was unknown. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, patient was taken to the ER and monitored for 12 hours but no admission. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

                                                Loss of voice; Asthma; her voice became extremely hoarse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included sore arm. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 (lot number: EN6198) on 23Feb2021 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn&#39;t tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn&#39;t want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn&#39;t used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn&#39;t want it to get worse. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination. The event hoarseness started on 18Mar2021 and loss of voice on 23Mar2021. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The outcome of the event hoarseness was not recovered, Loss of voice recovered on 13Apr2021 and asthma was unknown. The events hoarseness and loss of voice was reported as serious-medically significant.  Follow attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Hoarse voice and Loss of voice cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-year-old elderly female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date the patient experienced, the patient could not catch her breath, her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220 reported dyspnoea and hospitalization on an unspecified date, had high blood pressure, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing, coughing, soreness in her arm, slept all day long. Additional Context: Consumer states that her doctor wanted her to call and report this, because she has asthma and allergies that are chronic. Consumer states that she took her first Pfizer injection in April. She saw her allergy specialist on the 1st, and she tested the Consumer before she took the vaccine. She states that her breathing was at 113% breathing capacity (good) and the allergy specialist wanted her to go ahead and get the injection, which the Consumer did. Consumer clarifies that she received the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 11Apr2021 and that she did really good with that one. Consumer then received the second COVID vaccine on 13May2021. She came home and slept almost all night long and thought she was okay. The Consumer explains she was not feeling real good before she went to receive her second dose. It was kind of like she was having some coughing and stuff, but she thought it was not bad and that she could still go ahead and get it. She went ahead on 13May2021 and had the second dose. Consumer states that on the first day, she slept all day long- the whole entire day, she didn&#39;t even wake up. On the second day, the Consumer states that she had soreness in her arm. Then, she noticed she was getting really sick and started running a 99.9 temperature. It was getting worse day by day, and she kept coughing and getting worse. Then, on 18May2021, her husband took her to the emergency room and they just automatically treated her for asthma and allergy and sent her home. This was on Tuesday night. On Thursday night, she got so bad that her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her husband rushed her back to the ER and this time, they kept the Consumer and hospitalized her for a week. Her blood pressure was high. She clarifies normally her breathing on her peak flow meter, she can always do from 350-400. Well on Thursday night, her peak flow was all the way down to 220 and she could not catch her breath. Consumer states that she was admitted to the hospital and they had her on oxygen and blood pressure medication. She states that they did a bronch on her and still did not really come to a conclusion of what was happening. She was told it looked like it could be an infection in her lungs. Consumer states that she is having to see three doctors this week because of this since she got out of the hospital. She saw her medical doctor, Dr., yesterday who was very concerned because she had a recent patient that was about the same age as the Consumer- he was 75 years old. This patient had done the same thing, only he ended up taking pneumonia and dying with it. The doctor told the Consumer in her x-ray, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing. The Consumer asked her doctor while she was in the hospital about the pneumonia and they refused to listen to anything the Consumer said, so Dr. told her that the Consumer needed to report this because she is still so sick. Consumer clarifies that she was hospitalized for a week and that she just got out on Saturday, 29May2021. While reporting the event details, the Consumer stated that she had and emergency call coming through and that she had to take it. Consumer had to end the call, stating she had to go and requested this call handler call her back. The patient was hospitalized due to events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 99.9, peak expiratory flow rate: 220 Units: x-ray: had pneumonia showing. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I continued to take my heart medication sotalol. With the 2nd dose of vaccine, a few days later I had shortness of breath and difficulty getting a full breath.  About 2 and 1/2 weeks later, it was not getting better, so I went to the ER.   At the hospital, they took blood work, EKG,  MRI of the chest which all came back negative for heart attack and my lungs are clear.  I was discharged with instructions to see an allergist.  I went to see an allergist and was prescribed an albuterol inhaler and a steroid inhaler which I did not use.   It took about 1 more week for my breathing to be back to normal and cleared up on its own.

She had anaphylaxis to bees. With adhesive tapes she got dermatitis. With shellfish she got hives. She had a gluten sensitivity and with mango her mouth gets fuzzy. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s): her sisters had a few cancer. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received levofloxacin she had hives, with quinolones drug class she had hives, with thiopental she had hives and needed IV Decadron for it, with sertraline she has syncope, with Revatio she had an adverse event of joint and muscle pain, with ciprofloxacin she had tachycardia, with Enbrel it caused a drug induced pulmonary fibrosis granulomatosis, with Montelukast she had a headache and muscle pain, nitrofurantoin she had headache, with Symbicort it gave her hoarseness, she took Orencia for arthritis, she got the flu Vaccine in Sep2020. That was most recent. The patient had a grade 2 allergic reaction on 08Feb2021. The patient was watched after administering the vaccine on 08Feb2021 as she had background of multiple allergies and asthma. She was watched for 30 minutes in the oncology unit infusion suite. The reaction happened within 5 minutes of administration. Seriousness Criteria: Caller explained that this reaction was mild to moderate, there was a grade to intervene but at no point was she unstable, she did have a significant anxiety disorder, and so she was nervous about getting the vaccine.

The outcome of events allergic reaction, shortness of breath and flushed was recovered on 08Feb2021. Relatedness of drug to reaction(s)/event(s). Reaction assessed: Grade 2 allergic reaction; Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter. Method of assessment: Global Introspection. Drug result: Related. Causality: reporter stated that she did think the patient&#39;s base line anxiety played into the reaction she experienced, the reaction was aggravated by it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of grade 2 allergic reaction, short of breathe and flushed due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile. The patient&#39;s underlying allergic physique also predisposed the patient to developing the event. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                short of breath; nose bleed/lost a lot of blood/bleeding; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9263 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization, and eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); both via unspecified route of administration from unspecified date to 31Jan2021 at unknown dose and frequency for unspecified indication. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient had taken the first shot of the Pfizer shot on 26Jan2021 (Tuesday) and the patient seemed to managing it pretty well, she got short of breath one night (unspecified date) but in general, she felt okay. But several days later, 5 days later Sunday (31Jan2021), on Sunday morning she felt okay, what happened was she leaned a little bit, she bent down to wash her hands in the sink and she had a huge nose bleed, it was nothing like she ever had before, she was just wiping, spurting a lot of blood so this was 5 days. It was the morning of the 5th day and they had to call an ambulance to take her to the hospital and then she left the hospital. The patient had lost a lot of blood in the ambulance, they said they had never seen so much blood, they could not stop it, they kept giving her towels and the same thing in the hospital, in the emergency room. The patient was just bleeding over everywhere. The patient informed that for the last several years she has been having one baby aspirin and has been taking for the last few months or two, two or four Vascepa which was a fish oil supplement that can thin the blood but she has never had anything like this and they said go to her ENT, and she went up going ENT, and first time she went she would not take out the packing. The patient informed that it was too severe for her to take out the packing and, when she went back with her following time she took some of the packing and it started to bleed again and she cauterized it in a lot of places and you know would wait and do it again. And then she end up putting some kind of bandage that was going to help the blood clotting. Now, she has been subsequently going back to her and it was still in the very end of. The patient informed that she was still passing some very small blood clots, it has not even stopped. The patient informed that she was on 19 days passed already, since she had the bleed. The patient was very concerned. The patient informed that she was supposed to get her second vaccine in 2 to 3 days, Tuesday and she thought that this was the very bad experience that she had. The patient wanted to know if the aspirin and fish oil could have contributed to this, she stopped these as of 31Jan2021. The patient was talking to her daughter and her daughter has a friend whose mother lives in the same area and had her first Pfizer vaccine and had a small nose bleed right afterwards and then when she has second vaccine, she had another, a very bad. The patient informed that her daughter and a friend of hers said that a similar reaction occurred to her mother after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she had two small nasal bleeds and right afterwards, when she took the second vaccine she had a very big one, like hers, where she had to be taken to the hospital. The patient was concerned, she has been told that the response to the 2nd vaccine was stronger than the first. The patient further informed that she had no nose bleed like this before, like her husband was a physician, that she never had anything like this before, this was very serious kind of situation to happen, and this after the very first vaccine that she had. She had a very severe nosebleed, she had to go to the hospital to stop it. She was on a baby aspirin and some fish oil as well. The patient informed that she wasn&#39;t warned that this could thin her blood, that this was enough of a dose to do anything to create this deluge of bleeding.  The patient informed that she was few days out from getting her second shot and she had stopped the baby aspirin and the fish oil about three weeks ago. The patient informed that she was not going to take second. The patient wanted to know how long she was going to wait, how long she was going to test her antibody and see that she don&#39;t have any more antibodies and will go take the other brand vaccine. The patient added she was reporting that she had a terrible nosebleed and wanted to file a safety report. The patient wanted to know that if she choose not to get the 2nd vaccine, because of her worry of having this reaction again, how long would it be before she could get another vaccine; how long can she wait to get the second dose, or can she get a second dose from another manufacturer. The patient was requested to contact physician. The action taken in response to the events for eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA) and acetylsalicylic acid was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and plausible temporal association, the causality between the BNT162B2 and the event nosebleed cannot be excluded.  This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021191054 same reporter, similar drug/events, different patient

Reporter (Nurse) stated &#34;I had my first Pfizer vaccine on Friday, I think 22Jan2021 and the only thing I have was the sore arm and got really tired okay and the sore arm went away, it descended in about 12 hours and gracely went away, after that it started itching, okay no problem.  I had my second vaccine this past Friday at about 8 O&#39;clock between 8:15 in the morning. As the day went on I felt my arm is a little bit sore, no problem. Okay I went to bed and about 3 O&#39;clock in the morning, I woke up and I was shivering, I was so cold and I ached all over and I said okay I am getting the flu, went back to sleep, by the time I got up in the morning about 6 o&#39;clock the aching was gone but I could not walk, it was like I was drunk. I have a little dog and she was barking to go out and it was like 0 here so I sat there for a minute and I left her out and she started barking, to bring her back and I could not walk, I kept walking into the walls and my house was just this dark, I thought it&#39;s so dark in my house so I got my little dog back in, sat down and again and I thought what, maybe I will take my blood pressure, so I did and it was 66 over 48 so I though okay, so I started drinking, I thought I got to eat, I got to drink, so I get that, my pressure came up to 80 over 62 or something, my pulse rate was like 116, my O2 stat was like 98 percent so that was not a problem. So, I ate and drink, as the day went on the pressure came up to like about 103, gradually last night by the time I went to bed, the only thing I had was a little bit of headache, I did not thought enough to take anything for, when I went to bed, my pressure was like 120, the systolic was 120 and diastolic was like 70 something, this morning when I got up my pressure was in the 90&#39;s. I was not taking any blood pressure medication, I mean I have but doctor took me off long time ago, I did not I mean I have no aches, I have no pains, I have nothing just a little bit of headache, not even enough to bother me, every now and then I think about it, I also, I mean I thought I have got to the bathroom, I had diarrhea terribly, something, I did not know if any of this is from the vaccine. I have not called my primary, I thought I called him tomorrow I mean I am fine, I am little short of breath when I walk up to the stairs but that is nothing unusual.&#34; Causality: Reporter stated &#34;I don&#39;t know, I am thinking it does I never had anything like this before but you know I don&#39;t know, I don&#39; know, I am just reporting it, I am 79 so I don&#39;t know how much this is, I don&#39;t know.&#34; When probed from where reporter got the vaccine, Reporter stated &#34;I got it the first one at (Institute name).&#34; LOT# of COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 22Jan2021: Reporter stated &#34;You know it&#39;s not on my little card, just the LOT# of second one is on here.

                                                I went to the hospital with palpitations; lightheadedness; She had terrible back pain in center of back; She felt achy; fatigued; back discomfort; she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling; she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling; she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling; Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached.; had the worse headache; Her shoulder blade was tender; neck pain; achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles; achy feeling was ongoing with her legs; legs felt rubbery; short winded; sweaty; she felt clammy and hot.; she felt clammy and hot.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy. Shoulder swelling started a couple day after the second shot, explained it was there or about around 13Feb2021. Her shoulder blade was puffy and tender. The swelling went into the arm and breast. Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached. That took a while to go away. The patient explained initially it was also there or about around 13Feb2021 when she noticed she was so fatigue and had the worse headache (Feb2021), she never got nauseous. Her shoulder was still swollen a week ago as of 09Apr2021. She went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and the chiropractor said shoulder was still a little swollen. She had terrible back pain in center of back on 18Feb2021. It was so much that she was afraid something else was going on. The patient stated the swelling it was ongoing up until a few days ago as of 09Apr2021. She still had puffiness around that area when went to chiropractor. For the back discomfort she went to chiropractor for adjustment. She was unsure when that discomfort went away. The achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles and legs until last week as of 09Apr2021 when she started to feel better. Her legs felt rubbery. Her muscles felt achy. She felt better as of 09Apr2021. It had gotten better within the last week as of 09Apr2021. The fatigue was ongoing until last week as of 09Apr2021. The patient felt so bad for month and had no idea what was going on. Her lightheadedness went away last week as of 09Apr2021. She commented she did not want to blame all of this on the shot because she did not know what methylprednisolone did to her. The patient confirmed she had back discomfort. She still had some back discomfort. She started to fell short winded a week before the heart palpitations appeared really bad on 21Mar2021. She did not feel short winded anymore, but she was unsure when that stopped. With her heart palpitation she felt clammy and hot. Therefore, she wen to the ER. The heart palpitations gradually got better, and probably stopped totally last week as of 09Apr2021. She mentioned she had a headache for a good month after the second shot. It started either the 13Feb2021 or 14Feb2021. She stated all her symptoms were getting much better since last week as of 09Apr2021. There was no other treatment beside the methylprednisolone for her symptoms. Therapy start and stop date of methylprednisolone captured as confirmed by reporter in formal field, unable to clarify further. The patient confirmed all had been discarded and no lot/exp/NDC to provide. When she was in Emergency room, they did two EKG, drew blood work for the heart, chest x-ray back and front, and verified vital signs which were all good. She went home that same night on 21Mar2021. She went back to doctor on 05Apr2021 and did another chest x-ray and another echocardiogram and everything was fine. The event heart palpitation required a visit to emergency room, the patient was not sure if from the vaccine or methylprednisolone. The patient&#39;s heart rate got to 120, her normal was 80. The relevant Tests on 21Mar2021 they did Chest x-ray back and front, a couple EKG and blood work. The patient went back about a week ago as of 09Apr2021 because she was still not feeling great.

                                                The day after receiving vaccine (2/19) she experienced shortness of breath while shopping at store. She returned home without incident. She thinks she took a Benadryl because that is her usual response.  She took a shower on 2/20 and her torso turned bright red from neck to waist - she remembers taking a Benadryl for this   - the redness disappeared within about 20 minutes and has not returned. She called her doctor on Friday, possibly Monday she thinks. The MD office called and had her come in on Monday 3/8 for an evaluation. The SOB continues even now. It is worse with activity.

                                                Blood clot in lung; Shortness of breath; Felt tired; Slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6201), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right (also reported as &#34;injected intramuscularly in right arm&#34;) on 23Feb2021 13:00 (at the age of 79years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL8982) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 79years) for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (diagnosed prior to 10 years ago), respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities including diabetes, diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, and obesity (Little on the heavy side but she does not think she is obese); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure at 20 mg once daily, started at least 10 years ago. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that the patient had received the two doses, she had shortness of breath in the morning around 08:30 on 08Mar2021 and went to her doctor. They did blood work and she was put in the hospital because the doctor found out she had blood clots in her lungs (11Mar2021, 13:00). The patient was hospitalized for blood clot in lung from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021. She doesn&#39;t know if it came from the vaccine or not. She was sent home on Eliquis for 6 months to get blood clots from her lungs. She also has oxygen for when she needs it and mostly for when she is ambulatory. It was further clarified that when she went to her doctor&#39;s office, they did blood work. When they got results, they called her at home and told her that she had to call the ambulance and go the hospital in the ambulance, so she did; Ambulance to ER (hospital) on 11Mar2021. There was also a problem with the left ventricle of her heart (12 Mar2021 12:30). She stated whichever part pumps blood into the pulmonary vein, something is wrong there. She was going to have an echocardiogram to check that out again on 29Apr2021. She does not know the outcome of that yet until she gets that done. They gave her Eliquis as a blood thinner and oxygen.  She has not really needed the oxygen around the house.  But if she goes outside, she may. She took it to the grocery store with her and if she needed it, she used it.  She also had a headache after second dose on 24Feb2021 09:00. She felt tired on 24Feb2021 21:00 and stuff (as reported). The outcome of event blood clot in lung was unknown; the outcome of other events was recovering.

Per patient, she was gardening last week and developed chest pressure/SOB when moving around some mulch this lasted on and off for 3 days and then was followed by intense fatigue which persisted today so she came into ED. She was placed in observation for chest pain, and to rule out ischemia. Upon admission, a COVID-19 test was run for screening, and was positive. Other than fatigue and chest pain, she was not endorsing other symptoms and did not have hypoxia or coughing at all.  Although on admit, there was plan to get a stress test, given the COVID-19 diagnosis, this was deferred. She was discharged to home in stable condition on 5/5.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

                                                trouble breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 80-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249), by injection once to upper right arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for prevention. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced trouble breathing on 24Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. She got the vaccine shot last Thursday, later clarified as COVID vaccine, and she has read over the factual sheet given after the shot, she read it once quickly, will she be ok? She has difficulty breathing, one medication, she has that too, but not more often, with this she has been having it more often, she sleeps well during the night, it is just during the day. That was a severe reaction, two days ago or so, she can breathe sometime, but it&#39;s during the day, she read one dose effects say severe reaction, and it also says. she should have been given this paperwork before the vaccine, she didn&#39;t need it, she did not have an emergency, unless the second shot will be more helpful than one shot, after 3 weeks she gets another one. It says to call vaccine provider or healthcare professional if you have any effects that bother you or do not go away, how long do you wait until it doesn&#39;t go away? Why do they give the paperwork, why don&#39;t they give it at the doctor&#39;s office office before you set up an appointment to get vaccinated? Before so you can sit down and read the paperwork, she probably would not have gotten it, it says it is only only for emergency use for 16 and over, is this still a clinical trial, that information is not provided, and that burns her behind. She got the shot and 3 days later had the difficulty breathing, so she got it last Thursday, then started Sunday, Monday, into Tuesday, and it&#39;s just not. (caller did not complete sentence). Reporter email address declined. She hasn&#39;t told her doctor yet, provider&#39;s address and email address unknown. She thinks it started on Sunday, it wasn&#39;t yesterday, she thinks it was Sunday off and on, sometimes during day she can catch her breath, it may not be this or something, which is what she wants to find out, she is concerned with the idea this should not be sent out, she would not have gotten it. Has Pfizer received many calls about this, about the paperwork? It says it has not been approved, she would never have gotten it, it says only for emergencies, she doesn&#39;t have an emergency, this should have been given before the vaccination, it is probably still under clinical trial, but they are saying on TV everyone should be vaccinated, it is either up or down, yes or no, a see saw, yes they do something, then no, it&#39;s controversial, some part of paperwork says yes. Her breathing is not worse, this says it may go away in a few days, it says if it bothers you or does not go away, how long does she wait? It says severe reaction she doesn&#39;t understand, if it goes away, it doesn&#39;t bother her health, then goes away because of the vaccine inside, ok, once she got the vaccine, she had to stay in a room for 20 minutes or so, she had to stay in a room if she had a reaction. Her vaccine card says first dose, then says the hospital, she can&#39;t really read it, they write so quick. Says 11Feb2021 is her second dose She read in there, if you have an allergic reaction to other vaccines, she said no, this was her first reaction.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Immunotherapy was no longer working/had another mass; Immunotherapy was no longer working was reported as worsened/had another mass; Having more issues with breathing; emphysema; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 80-years-old female elderly patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201, expiration: not reported), intramuscular, administered in arm left on 18Feb2021 at 18:00-18:30 as second dose, single for covid-19 immunization(at the age of 80years). Medical history included cancer. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Other and family medical history was none.Concomitant medications included prednisone -1mg daily; was a higher dose back when she started and was now decrease,) taken for polymyalgia from Oct2020 to an unspecified stop date; pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA) taken for Stage 3 Lung Adenocarcinoma (non-small cell) from 02Jan2021 to an unspecified stop date, infused once every 3 weeks; received infusion at chemotherapy center; no sample of the product available to be returned, packaging sealed and intact.  Previously, the patient received historical vaccine of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19, Solution for injection, Lot EL9265, expiration was unknown) injected intramuscularly, administered in upper arm left on 28Jan2021 as first dose, single for covid-19 immunisation , barely felt it and no adverse event following prior vaccinations. The patient received it and was going through immunotherapy cancer treatment and was doing well. On 05Feb2021, she saw her in her office and was doing well with shrinkage and treatment with first mass, can decrease to once a month instead of 3 weeks. Then when she had second shot she just found out it got bigger. It was reported that on 07Apr2021, she got a CT scan and it showed she had another mass. She saw CT result sooner but did not discuss with her doctor until then. The CT scan also had emphysema (Start date: 2021) which she was not aware of as no one had ever verbally talked to her about that before. She saw the doctor on 14Apr2021 09:30, and said immunotherapy is no longer working. Her doctor wanted to stop the Keytruda, since it was not working, but they agreed to continue for 3 more sessions and do another scan after that. She has had things get worse, since she has a new mass and is having more issues with breathing since saying the immunotherapy is no longer working. One infusion of KEYTRUDA was skipped and then started again to see if it will kick in and start up again. The patient was wondering how the best way was to report a possible link and her immuno-therapy. Back when the vaccine first come out, it was questionable if cancer patients should or would get the vaccine and then they decided yes, and she did it. She would like to know if Pfizer was doing any further follow up with that population and was there any new info on cancer patients who have received the vaccine and whether are monitoring that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT which showed she had another mass and emphysema on 07Apr2021. No other relevant test. Outcome for more issues with breathing was unknown and for rest of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Inside of mouth no longer burning ,   Swelling in lips has gone down, they have been peeling for days.  Lips are red, still sore, but I&#39;m hoping they are done peeling. I really don&#39;t feel I can handle another shot of this vaccine.   I think I may have to cancel the second shot.  I don&#39;t know what is it it, everyone keeps telling me it has no penicillin or sulfa drugs in it, but the symptoms are the same.  The only difference is my hands haven&#39;t cracked and peeled along with my lips and mouth.  I&#39;ve had these problems since last tuesday night and am taking Benadryl trying to get some relief from it still.  Please let me know if you have any solutions to prevent this.

We gave her water to drink but then she started crying again and seemed to have more anxiety. Paramedics came within 15 minutes and took over.

                                                my head and ears closed down; my head and ears closed down; she doesn&#39;t sleep all night long; her body was shaking; my heart was beating out of my chest; felt a little lazy and tired; tinge-y pains in her heart; SVT; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 21Feb2021 at 08:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included seasonal asthma, allergy to class A antihistamines that started in her 20s, facial &amp; peripheral edema, blood pressure abnormal, and celiac disease. The patient had known allergy to Benadryl and when she takes it she gets peripheral and facial edema, lip swelling, top and bottom, hives around her whole right eye. The patient also has an allergy to Class A antihistamines that started in her 20s. She said the allergy started with Seldane &amp; Claritin. She said she had giant hives with Claritin. She said she was told there were 2 classes of antihistamines &amp; she couldn&#39;t use the Class A antihistamines. She said she previously reported her Seldane, Claritin &amp; Benadryl allergies, saying she has facial &amp; peripheral edema. She said she only uses the Class B antihistamine Cimetidine now. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, omeprazole, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date, the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction, rash. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced &#34;her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell,&#34; multiple hives all around her right eye, wheezing, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable. On 21Feb2021 at 14:00 (reported as about 2PM), the patient experienced &#34;Itching eyes/My eyes started itching.&#34; On 21Feb2021 at 21:00 (reported as 9PM), the patient experienced little coughing spell. The reporter considered the events swelling lips, itching eyes, multiple hives all around her right eye, and wheezing as serious medically significant. The patient further reported that she felt fine after the shot, her arm was not sore, nothing. She said her arm was fine, and she had no problems, whatsoever, after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E73246, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 14:15 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac pacemaker insertion, high blood pressure for years. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took flu shot (FLU VACCINE II) and never had a reaction to the flu shot, macrodantin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and hives. It was reported that about 15:15, injection site felt like it was on fire and then the whole arm felt like it was on fire. The patient got concerned. Her throat felt like it was going to close. Symptoms got less severe. She was fine yesterday and was fine that day. She called her doctor and was advised to put cold compresses on the arm and take Tylenol. She was ok. She read an article that stated if a person had a reaction to not have the second shot. She did not know if her reaction is severe. The second shot is due around 27Jan2021. She wanted to know what to do.  She felt fine on the day of report and was fine 2-3 hours after the onset of the hot and fiery feeling. It was scary and she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She also added that around 15:15, the injection arm felt like it was on fire. She felt flushed. Her throat felt like it would close up but never did. Everything resolved 2-3 hours after it started. Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 06Jan2021.

                                                Heart attack; Asthma attacks; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date (she has had Asthma for about 14-15 years), broke back from an unknown date (she broke her back about 3 years ago); stent placement from an unknown date (she had 2 heart stents placed about 2 years ago), and then she said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 16Mar2021. She said she would really like to know if the COVID-19 Vaccine possibly caused her to have the worse asthma attack she ever had in her life on 17Mar2021. She clarified she was talking to her friend on the telephone when she had her asthma attack at 3:30PM. She said that on 18Mar2021 at 5:00AM, she had a second asthma attack. She said her second asthma attack was not as bad as the one she had on 17Mar2021. For her first asthma attack on 17Mar2021, she took 2 puffs from her inhaler, and then an additional 2 puffs (4 puffs total). She said her doctor told her if she had a bad asthma attack, she could take 2 more puffs from the inhaler. She said she normally takes 2 puffs from her inhaler. She said for her second asthma attack on 18Mar2021 she took only 2 puffs from her inhaler. After she took her 2 puffs from her ProAir HFA Albuterol Sulfate inhaler, she flopped back into her bed. She reported she normally has 3-4 asthma attacks a year. She reported that her doctor did a complete blood workup on 03Mar2021 and told her she was doing just lovely. The patient also reported she had a very mild heart attack and she can&#39;t even take low dose aspirin. The patient also reported she had another question about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) and wanted to know if anything in the list of the COVID-19 Vaccine ingredients would indicate her having a possible allergy to the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and/or Physician Office. The outcome of the event asthma attack was recovering, and for the heart attack was unknown.

                                                4/10/21 ER HPI: 82 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department by paramedics from a local nursing home.  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

An 82-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER CORONA VIRUS VACCINES-COVID-19), dose 2 intramuscularly administered in the right arm on 04Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER CORONA VIRUS VACCINES-COVID-19) on an unspecified date for Covid-19 immunisation. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); calcium; acetylcysteine, calcium levomefolate, mecobalamin (METAFOLBIC PLUS); losartan; hydrochlorothiazide; denosumab (PROLIA) and trazodone; all indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was unknown if the patient receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that in the evening of the vaccination (04Mar2021), she developed chills and fever, then chest pain and shortness of breath. The physician obtained a CXR (chest x-ray) on the patient on 04Mar2021 and found that she had pneumonia. She was treated with levofloxacin and prednisone. The physician rechecked her in one week and gave her Kenalog injection and Rocephin injection. The physician rechecked her on 22Mar2021 and she was improved, but she returned to the office 12Apr2021 with left leg swelling. The ultrasound on 12Apr2021 showed an occlusive clot in her femoral artery. The patient was admitted to the hospital (Apr2021) for 1 day and placed on heparin, then sent home on Eliquis. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and the patient received treatment which included antibiotics and steroids for pneumonia and blood thinners for the femoral vein clot. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events leg swelling, occlusive clot in her femoral artery and femoral vein clot were recovered on Apr2021 while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 22Mar2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events peripheral swelling, peripheral artery thrombosis and venous thrombosis limb and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.The case will be reassessed once new information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Current status reviewed with resident staff. I have reviewed pertinent physician documentation, laboratory and radiographic data. I have initiated therapies based upon this reviewed  In brief 82-year-old woman with history of COPD, mediastinal mass status post VATS with benign thymoma with local recurrence presented with respiratory tract symptoms since 6 days prior to admission COVID testing is positive. In the emergency room she was noted be hypoxemic requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations. She is currently on high-flow feels much improved.  I concur with exam as per Pulmonary fellow. Laboratories and imaging reviewed in detail.  Impression COVID-19 infection COVID-19 pneumonia Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen Thrombocytopenia which is new since 2016 and a poor prognostic sign History of benign thymoma with local recurrence COPD with exacerbation Doubt bacterial pneumonia  Recommendation: Remdesavir 5 days Corticosteroids. Optimum dosing induration of corticosteroids has yet to be fully defined. Decadron 6 mg daily is reasonable however if develops progressive disease in the next 24 hr would escalate corticosteroids and would also add IL 6 inhibitor Additional minerals and vitamin supple role is unclear but probably benign If thrombocytopenia worsens may need alternative anticoagulation. Would check venous Dopplers Supplemental oxygen for saturations greater than 88% Daily PPI unless anticoagulation intensified then would go to q.12 hours Would favor discontinuing antibiotics

She saw her Primary Care Dr on  5/10/2021 after experiencing dizziness, fatigue, confusion.  She had lost a considerable amount of weight during this time and I was concerned and accompanied her to the doctor visit.  Dr prescribed cyanocobalamin B-12 as she had been defficient in her latest blood analysis on 3/15/2021.  She also added Donepezil 5mg tablet daily and trazodone 50 mg nightly to help with sleep.  She gave referral to get Neuroligical evaluation.  My mother had a driving episode on 4/30/2021 where she was taken to Medical Center and some Scans were taken of her brain that were apparently normal they contacted me to pick her up around 2:30 AM 5/01/2021.  The number on her release folder to obtain medical Records.  My mother was residing with me my home until her appointment for evaluation .  She passed away on 6/02/2021 in my home.. Dr  was contacted to sign off on her Death Certificate .  I have not received Death Certificate as of today but I believe the cause she was putting was Natural Causes due to age.

She took 50 milligrams of Benadryl and got up and walked around.  She reports that her symptoms resolved after about 30 minutes and she went back to bed without any difficulty.  She has had a previous history of anaphylactic reaction to atenolol and chlorthalidone, which do not appear to have a cross reaction to the vaccine.  She is wondering if she should cancel her 2nd vaccine appointment and is concerned that she may not have full immunity with only 1 vaccine dose. Dr. recommends that she not receive the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                she is short of hearing; losing her breathe; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer sponsored program. An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: Stage 3 lung cancer, radioactive therapy on 25Dec2020 to 31Dec2020 (Also reported as 2-days prior to her 1st vaccine shot, the nurse gave her 2 radioactive therapy and the last one was 31Dec2020), immune therapy on 01Jan2021 (7 weeks&#39; worth received all in 7 days), and steroid therapy on December 2020 and Jan2021. The patient had terrible reaction from the immune therapy on an unspecified date which include all the skin of her mouth had ulcers, had such sickness, diarrhea, a rash all over the face, had headaches, was so fatigued, no energy and could not get out of bed. Patient felt better in the past few days. Other medical history included had a bad fall, two broken ribs and needed hip replacement surgery from unspecified dates. She lives alone and received 700 units a day of steroids for 10-days last December.  Family history included lung cancer runs in her family (sister and brother died of lung cancer, other sister got it too).  Patient stated her doctor called her in 2 days before and stated her next step was immune therapy, she has had massive doses of radioactive before, she had 7 weeks of that in 10 days, and had an extreme reaction from that, the last one was 31Dec2020. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated she refused her immune therapy, as she wanted the vaccine. It was put down as she did not want it. The patient reported that nurse there then said she was going to be put on unspecified steroid, which she never had before. Her friend picked up the prescription and, without reading everything, and she usually does, she took two of them. It said take all 6 that evening, but she took 2 then read and it said not to take with any vaccine. She stated that the nurse knew how she stressed she wanted the vaccine, and so she had the COVID vaccine. She just had the two steroids, and she said she wanted to wait until Mar2021 until she considered getting immune therapy, but the nurse booked her for 26Feb2021, and she had her second vaccine from Pfizer scheduled on 19Feb2021 one week apart. She asked if that is too soon, and does she need to put off immune therapy again. She read it is 2-3 weeks between, she wanted to have this verified. Patient stated she supposed to take 6 steroids then 5 and so on. She took 2 pills then as she was reading information regarding the vaccine, she did not take anymore.  Last week is when she took the two steroids, she won&#39;t take them. She called a pharmacist, who said do not take them. The doctor&#39;s office, the nurse, gave them, after she told them she would have the vaccine. She stated she was furious, but she was getting this all the way down the line. She put the steroids away, she said she was not taking them, she talked to someone in the medical field and told her how she felt, and she agreed.  Patient asked if it will be ok to have the immune therapy at that time and soon after getting the vaccine if it would be effective. She mentioned that at her age she is more concerned that she gets that vaccine and she wants to delay having the immune therapy until March given the horrible reaction she had before. She tried and tried to have this conversation with her doctors, but she does not have all that technology and they are only offering remote appointments. Patient stated that she had no problems from the first dose of the vaccine stating she did not even feel the needle. She has been exactly an hour on the phone. The patient stated that she was losing her breathe after speaking at this time during the call on 05Feb2021. She also stated she is short of hearing (onset date unknown). Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Feb2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included right partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the remote past, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, morbid obesity, motion sickness, unspecified allergy as the patient cannot tolerate anything but paracetamol (TYLENOL), acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) tablet, meclizine hcl tablet for motion relief and hydrochlorothiazide/ triamterene (DYAZIDE) capsule. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) in the left arm and experienced difficulty breathing, ground glass opaque lung problem, weak, nausea, &#34;pain on rt.side waist around to back, down to lower belly&#34;, slight temp almost 100. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and inability to eat for two days. The patient reportedly received the second dose of BNT162B2 four days prior to coming to the emergency room (ER). In the ER, the patient reported severe asthenia, mild upper abdominal pain and dysphagia, all as of an unspecified date. The patient underwent a CTA in the ER, on Feb2021, which showed no acute pulmonary embolism, or no ground glass infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 21Feb2021 at 17:51 for management of worsening shortness of breath. Due to the patient&#39;s acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema and obesity, hypoventilation (as of an unspecified date in Feb2021) was further complicated by obstructive sleep apnea, thus, the patient was admitted to &#34;MedSurg&#34;. The patient did not present with COVID-19 or COPD. The BMP was 226 at the time of admission. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen and additionally started on CPAP at night. She was seen by a pulmonologist who recommended Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR). Pulmonology also recommended to work-up any underlying unaddressed coronary artery disease contributing to the patient&#39;s shortness of breath. The patient underwent an echocardiogram on Feb2021 with regadenoson (LEXISCAN) for her shortness of breath which was within normal limits. As the patient additionally reported dysphagia at the time of admission, she was evaluated by a speech and swallow evaluation specialist as well as a gastroenterologist. A GI swallow series was recommended which the patient underwent on Feb2021 and was found to have no active signs of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. The patient additionally underwent a physical exam on 24Feb2021 at 08:00 with the following results. Vital signs: Temp: 98.2, Pulse: 69, Resp: 17, B/P (MAP): 98/62 (74), Pulse Ox: 96, O2 Delivery: Nasal cannula, O2 flow rate:2.00. HEENT: Pupils equal round reactive light accommodation, no lymphadenopathy noted, neck vens were apple. CVS: S1-S2 normal, no appreciable murmur rub or gallop noted. Respiratory: Good Inspiratory effort, good air entry bilaterally, no rhonchi, Rales or wheezes heard. Gl: Abdomen soft, nontender nondistended, bowel sounds heard, no organomegaly detected. Extremities: Bilateral lower extremities Shaw no edema, bilateral dorsalis pedis 2&#43;, skin appeared intact. Neurological: Patient alert and oriented x3, strength 5x5 in all 4 extremities, no signs of focal neurological deficits. Skin: No clear breakdown or rashes noted. The patient was being discharged home on 24Feb2021 at 08:04 with a CPAP machine. The patient was prescribed Cefuroxime axetil (CEFTIN) 250mg Tablet orally twice a day; Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR) 250-50 diskus 1 puff twice a day for progressive shortness of breath and hypoventilation. The patient had been advised to follow-up with a pulmonologist for an outpatient pulmonary function test. The clinical outcome of progressive shortness of breath, hypoventilation, inability to eat, dysphagia, severe asthenia and mild upper abdominal pain was unknown. The reporting physician considered that BNT162B2 had no causal effect on the events reported.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: In agreement with the HCP reporter, the reported events  do not appear to be related to the subject vaccine. The events likely represent intercurrent medical conditions, possibly associated with the patient&#39;s history of  emphysema. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported: did not get a card that lists NDC, Lot, Expiration) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. It was also reported that no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient did not require visit to Emergency Room and stated that she was desperate and would&#39;ve gone but she didn&#39;t have a ride and added she is worried about the second. Also, the patient did not required visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE),  via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose (at the age of 83-years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included the patient had known allergies (unspecified) and unspecified chronic health conditions from an unknown date.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient was not pregnant. The patient received unspecified concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 15Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough. The events resulted in emergency room visit and the patient was hospitalized (from an unknown date) for the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough for 6 days. The clinical course is as follows: 2 or 3 weeks after the patient got the vaccine she started getting out of breath when she walked. Each day she got worse. Then the patient was taken to the hospital where they discovered the patient had three blood clots. The clots were in the patient&#39;s leg, heart and lung. The patient stated the Doctors do not understand where the clots came from. The patient was in the hospital 6 days. The patient stated they are still having breathing problem and still on oxygen as needed and they still cough at night. The patient asked if there have been any other reports of this happening to other people who got the vaccine as the patient never had blood clots before this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (nasal swab): negative on 15Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough and included blood thinners and oxygen therapy and complete bed rest. The clinical outcome of the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Six days after the second dose of Pfizer I started experiencing shortness of breath so I went to the ER and took a chest x-ray and had fluid in my lungs. Doctors discovered I had Atrial Fibrillation. In January I had an Echo Cardiogram and none of the previous described diagnoses were present then. I was admitted; doctors attempted to shock my heart back into rhythm several times but were unsuccessful. Therefore, I was put on Eliquis (5mg) and a water pill to get rid of the fluid in my lungs (and swollen ankles). I was hospitalized for 9 days where I was evaluated through numerous tests. Eventually it was suggested that I undergo the Watchman&#39;s Procedure to get off blood thinners. Everything went well with that surgery on Thursday May 20th; complications arose after the surgery: heart rate and blood pressure spike, lungs started filling up with fluid. Ended up in ICU for four days. I still have a problem with my lungs despite having no history of lung problems and I am now dealing with AFIB. This all started 6 days after my second shot.

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

                                                suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now; shortness of breath; hoarse/ hoarseness; audible wheezing; doesn&#39;t have the energy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 84-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2019 and ongoing, when she would sleep her oxygen would drop, and shrunk from 5 feet 5 1/4 inches to now 5 feet 2 inches. She never found out why her oxygen saturations dropped at night but she does not have sleep apnea. Her saturations would drop down to the 80s and she would still be sleeping. Concomitant medications included ongoing albuterol [salbutamol] taken for asthma and oxygen taken for &#34;when she would sleep her oxygen would drop&#34; from 2012 and ongoing. Patient previously took Anoro and Qvar in Aug2019. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 25Feb2021 (lot number: EN6206, NDC:59267-1000-01, Expiry date unknown) in the left arm. With the first vaccine she did not have any symptoms, she thought she got saline. Only symptoms she felt were when they told her to wait 15 minutes and she sat there and when she got up and she was driving and had her window down her nose felt like it was swelling. She lost her sense of smell due to an injury and she had an acute sense of smell of tobacco from the car next to her. That is the only symptom she had. The acute sense of smell was about 30 minutes after she got her injection, about 5-7 minutes after that. She left about 10:30 am and it happened around 10:35-10:37 am. The acute sense of smell was short lived, it happened for a minute or two. Several years ago she had shoulder surgery and had her great granddaughter and she was playing with her and her foot got caught in the coffee table and she fell and her nose got cut and lost her sense of smell. When asked for seriousness criteria, patient stated it was significant because she had not been able to smell since 2011 and she had the sensation of her nose swelling. She felt like that but she was driving and could not look at her nose. She didn&#39;t have the feeling 15 minutes after the vaccine, she had been driving for 5-7 minutes and had the feeling and it was exactly when she got in the car. It was significant because she was able to smell something. Patient had her second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Mar2021 and had shortness of breath. She suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now. She did not seem to be getting better and the slightest movement, she&#39;s short of breath. She is taking the medicine that she normally takes but never had to take it this much. She was short of breath and not paying that much attention to it, when she goes out she wears a mask, since last year, and she went to put the trash out and had shortness of breath stepping out the back door. She was talking to a friend long distance and she told her she was so short of breath. To get out of bed and turn in bed she&#39;s more short of breath. The shortness of breath may have started before Friday 26Mar2021 but that&#39;s when she noticed it. She would have her mask on, park her car and go to the post office and when she would walk to her PO box, which is the first of the boxes, she was exhausted and not getting enough air and she noticed it. But then when she went outside to put the trash out, just a step outside she was short of breath, that&#39;s when she began to notice. She has never been this short of breath and her breathing and exchange of air has never been this bad. She thought she would maybe get her smell back and in all the years she&#39;s been diagnosed with asthma she&#39;s never had the wheezing and shortness of breath that she&#39;s had now. She&#39;s never heard herself wheeze. Monday night she was up at 3 am and got up to go to the bathroom and she was so short of breath. She had to take it at 3:30 am and that had never happened to her. She never had wheezing until the second vaccine. She doesn&#39;t need a stethoscope to hear the wheezing and that most people have asthma with wheezing but she did not. Patient was not taking the Qvar until after the second dose of the vaccine and was only using the albuterol before. She would take two puffs in her car and then put two masks before getting out. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No AE required a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was scheduled to see her primary doctor on 13Apr2021 but could not get in earlier and attempted to see her pulmonary doctor and the earliest she can is 07Apr2021 and she has that appointment. Patient was also very hoarse. From time to time medications like her inhaler for her asthma sometimes makes her hoarse. This time she has the hoarseness even when she doesn&#39;t take her inhaler. She has audible wheezing. She would not consider the shortness of breath life threatening but it is concerning because she is not able to do what she needs to do because she doesn&#39;t have the energy. Hoarseness is worsening because she is taking more of the medications she&#39;s normally taking and now she is taking the inhaler twice a day because she is more short of breath. The one inhaler she is using is Qvar. She has been taking the albuterol more also. Hoarseness is not life threatening, it is effective but it is not disabling. The more she talks, the more hoarse she gets. Relatedness of drug to reactions shortness of breath, very hoarse, by primary source reporter (Method of assessment: Global Introspection) was related. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Asthma aggravated and Shortness of breath cannot be excluded. Medical history of asthma may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

The Pharmacist had advised her to sit and wait 30 min. after the shot, due to her anaphylaxis history from multiple things. The Pharmacist monitored her and she continued to report itching on the forearm where she got the shot (not around the site) and slight shortness of breath. The patient never appeared to be in distress. As the symptoms continued, the Pharmacist decided, though an Epipen was ready to use, to call 911.  Paramedics arrived within 5 to 7 min., questioned her, took her BP, Oxygen level and listened to her breathing (all were good). She said she was feeling better and said &#34;no&#34; when they asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital. The paramedics stayed with her about 10 minutes longer and she left with her family. She did not receive any Epipen or Benadryl (is allergic to it) but wanted to take a box of Claritin 10 mg with her (said it always helps). The paramedic told her Claritin will not help anaphylaxis (for future). The patient was advised to contact her physician because she probably would be at high risk for a second Covid vaccine.

Her daughter (me!) visited and immediately called her pulmonologist who requested she immediately go to the hospital.  The ER said she had an enlarged heart, and was checked in to the cardiac unit.  Tests showed she had acute systolic and diastolic heart failure.  She was first put on diuretics while further tests were done, and Tikosyn was later added to her list of regular medications.  Within a week she was able to go home.  She was on oxygen prior to this event from the pulmonary fibrosis, and was able to return to her prior settings on her oxygen concentrator within five days, but her ongoing discomfort has stayed at a heightened level, and her level of activity has not returned to her normal.  Please note:  she is an 84 year old with pulmonary fibrosis.  It is not possible for me as her daughter (not a medical professional) to know if the original diagnosis of heart inflammation was related to her vaccination, but she had been relatively stable for more than six months prior to this hospitalization event and the onset of this sequence of events was identified by the doctors as being of unknown origin at that time.

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine. AEs result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent covid test: negative in May2021. The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate; Reported Cause(s) of Death: ischemic stroke; infection

On 4/9/2021 she was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with extensive clot burden within the interlobal pulmonary arteries bilaterally as well as upper lobar branches. Venous Doppler was a performed on 4/10/21 blood clots found in both lower legs Please note that I attempted several times to report this to Pfizer, I was disconnected once and was on hold for over hour with the same automated message replaying that there were 6 callers ahead of me. There was no option to leave a message for a return call to share what I feel is important safety information.

She was found to have a n intramuscular hematoma along her posterior right thigh and with an acute DVT in her leg - see imaging  reports below.  Her INR was in the 7 range. She was also found to be in cardiogenic shock as mentioned above, requiring pressors.  Pressors were eventually weaned off. S/p PRBCs. Imaging studies were obtained.  Findings are listed below. Her AKI resolved by day of discharge.    Since hospital discharge: The swelling is improving along her right leg.  She is not checking her weight on a daily basis.  She has access to a scale.   She needs a refill on iron and Fosamax.  No bleeding.  On day of discharge, her hemoglobin was 8.8.  Her MCV was elevated at 100.  Her platelet count was 132.  Her INR was 1.4.  Her calcium is mildly low at 8.3.   Her coumadin is on hold at this time.   106/56 was her BP today. She&#39;s been resting well. She&#39;s doing some house chores.  She has yet to schedule a follow-up visit with for an INR check and in office checkup apt since hospital discharge.   4/23/21 RLE CT: Postop changes from ACDF for right femoral neck fracture again noted with good alignment. Early healing process of the fracture noted. No acute osseous fracture or hardware fracture. Extensive muscular and subcutaneous edema in right thigh. Two elongated intramuscular hematomas also noted at the medial posterior right thigh as above.   4/23/21 CXR: Patchy bibasilar pleural parenchymal opacities and enlarged cardiac silhouette without interval change. Multiple thoracic compression deformities better characterize on recent CT. Postoperative changes as discussed. Stable hiatal hernia.   4/23/21 RUQ Ultrasound: Mild gallbladder prominence, nonspecific. Findings similar to reference CT. No gallbladder wall thickening. Negative sonographic Murphy sign. Trace ascites. Partially evaluated right pleural effusion. Increased renal echogenicity. Correlate for medical renal disease. -1.1 cm right renal cyst.   4/22/21 PVL Study: Acute non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the mid and distal femoral vein within the right lower extremity. Acute non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the distal femoral vein within the left lower extremity.   4/21/21 Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT: Age-indeterminate T1, T3, T8, and T9 compression deformities. Subacute or chronic right posterior 12th, 11th, and 10th rib fractures. Intramuscular hematoma in the posterior right thigh, partially visualized. Subcutaneous contusion in the right posterior hip region. Small volume of free fluid which appears minimally complex. No convincing solid organ injury, but assessment is limited without administration of intravenous contrast. Mild biliary dilatation of uncertain etiology. Possible 1.8 cm peripherally calcified splenic artery aneurysm. Nonspecific bilateral perinephric stranding. Trace pleural effusions. Moderate sliding-type hiatal hernia. Additional incidentals as above.   4/21/21 C Spine CT: Age-indeterminate T1 compression fracture, new from March 2019. No other acute fracture or subluxation

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

                                                The day after the first shot, my mother had bad knee pain in her left knee. It went on for days/week. After the second dose, days out she started feel very tired and bad pain in her feet that went to her hands and she couldn&#39;t get out of bed or urinate properly. Her facility doctor gave her Gabepentin for the pain but it did not help. She declined over a week or so and then She was admitted into the hospital for dehydration (March 19, 2021). The put a catheter in her to get urine out and bring her kidney function back to her normal (she does have kidney disease). Gave her more Gabepentin (which does not help pain in feet an hands) and released her to rehab. and she is now on oxygen.  Rehab was bad so I got her out and released to her facility so she could receive rehab there. She declined again with the same reaction: extreme fatigue, can&#39;t walk and now urinates and defecates in an adult diaper and now breathing is very labored.  She was admitted to the hospital and they can&#39;t find out why she is in this way. They did blood work, tests, scan and X-rays without any answers. They switched up meds on her and then released her to rehab since she hasn&#39;t walked in weeks/month at this point. She is regaining strength but now on oxygen even when sitting. She is 86 and walked with a walker all around her facility and when going to doctor appointments. Now she is in a wheelchair for doctor appointments since she has no strength and needs oxygen to walk. Her facility saw her decline after the second shot and my mom is very vocal and each day told them how she felt awful and it is because of the shot. She still has neuropathy in her feet and hands but it is not as painful as it originally was and it peaked and now just painful about a 5-6 on a scale of 0-10.

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 86 years old on 17Feb2021 (Lot number EL3302) received in her arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Ongoing medical history included Low functioning kidney for probably 15 years, Platelete condition for probably 20 years, COPD since she was in her 40&#39;s, Asthma for over 40 years, Chronic heart failure for 10 or more years, high blood pressure, acid reflux, allergies, retains water, neuropathy in hands and feet, mucous in the lungs, thyroid condition, hypo for more than 20 years, bad lower back and bad left shoulder, nerves, anxiety, to sleep, to calm her nerves, walked with a walker. Concomitant medications included amlodipine ongoing for high blood pressure; ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) ongoing; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) ongoing for heart condition; atorvastatin ongoing; fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) ongoing for asthma, COPD; buspirone ongoing; carvedilol ongoing; clotrimazole; famotidine ongoing for acid reflux; ferrous sulfate from an unspecified date to Apr2021 as Iron supplement; fluticasone propionate ongoing for allergies and asthma; fluticasone, salmeterol ongoing; folic acid ongoing; furosemide ongoing for retains water; gabapentin from Feb2021 and ongoing for neuropathy in hands and feet; guaifenesin ongoing for mucous in the lungs; hydroxyurea ongoing for her bone marrow made too many platelets; levothyroxine sodium ongoing for thyroid condition, hypo; lidocaine hydrochloride (LIDOCAINE) for bad lower back and bad left shoulder; magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) ongoing; montelukast for allergy and asthma; sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) ongoing; sitagliptin ongoing; temazepam for nerves and anxiety; linagliptin (TRADJENTA) ongoing; trazodone ongoing to sleep, to calm her nerves; valsartan for high blood pressure; vitamin D. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number EK4176) on 27Jan2021 received in one of her arms for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe pain in her left knee. The patient received the second vaccine on 17Feb2021. A week out or so she started having pain in her feet and she was very fatigued 19Mar2021; both still ongoing, both on a week. The patient had had 2 stints at the hospital, and 2 rehabs. Both of these have very slightly improved. The patient went to the hospital due to the pain in her feet that moved up to her hands, she was very fatigued, and she couldn&#39;t walk; she was bedridden on 19Mar2021. Weeks after the shot it continued day after day after day up until 19Mar2021 where she was admitted to the hospital. The patient just had her last stint in rehab this past 2 weeks and could get up with physical therapy. Hospitalization was from 19Mar2021 to 27Mar2021. The patient could not urinate properly, she couldn&#39;t void all the way and that this occurred some time between after the second vaccine up until 19Mar2021. Those few weeks things progressed. Now she was incontinent and had to wear diapers. She urinates in diapers and defecates in diapers. The incontinence started sometime during 19Mar2021 to 27Mar2021 and it is ongoing, persisting. In the hospital they could not find anything seriously wrong with her. The patient had total fatigue and the caller begged them to give her mother a (vitamin) B12 shot. They gave it to her but there was no improvement with patient&#39;s energy. They put a catheter in her to get her kidney function back to her normal level. It was because she was not urinating properly. They ran a bunch of tests and there was not anything wrong with her. They did cardiac tests, lung tests, and XRays. The patient&#39;s breathing was labored. Started sometime after the second shot leading up to the hospital and that the patient had to be on oxygen. She said she was still on oxygen and that the labored breathing was ongoing, persisting. Reporter said all of these above listed were from 25Apr2021 to 03May2021. They did more tests but there were no answers and patient was at this point bedridden all this time; she had no strength at all, all the same symptoms were ongoing, there were no diagnoses, they were switching her meds around. The patient was on oxygen 24/7, all day when she was walking, sitting in a room in her wheelchair. The caller said she was hoping patient could get up and walk around but she was still weak. She said with time she hoped she got better on feet, got back to her normal. The outcome of the events were not resolved. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The patient received her 1st Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine then within approximately 10 minutes she started complaining of shortness of breath and stated she &#34;needed oxygen for my heart failure&#34;.  I then directed her son to wheel her back to a room and the charge nurse grabbed the Oxygen for us.  We took a pulse on room air and she was bouncing around 84-85%.    At this point she began to have uncontrolled jerking movements in her neck, upper and lower extremities.  She was talking during these and never lost consciousness.  When the shaking started I had the nurse call 911 to get EMS on the way.    She then had her O2 by nasal canula placed and it was turned up to 6L to start until O2 came up to 98%.  We then slowly turned town to 3L and maintained SpO2 around 97%.  Involuntary muscle jerking continued although it was a little less severe.  EMS came and transferred her to the ER.

Albuterol nebulizer treatment attempted but patient was too anxious to complete. Gave 2 puffs albuterol oral inhaler, and repeated treatment 15 min later followed by a small glass of cola. About 30min later patient calmed, no longer short of breath and pulse strong but face remained flushed. Vitals at 9:20pm included BP 116/47, pulse 67. Following day patient had multiple involuntary diarrheal stools. Symptoms reported to provider 2/8 and noted to be resolved.

                                                The day after receiving the Covid vaccine, I began having shortness of breath.  I had no fever. my blood pressure stayed normal, however, my pulse was elevated and my heartbeat accelerated whenever I exerted myself. This continued from Wednesday to Saturday when I began to feel somewhat better.

Within 5 minutes of receiving the 2nd COVID 19 vaccine, the patient began to report that she was feeling sharp shooting pains in her legs, arms and chest. The patient reported feeling anxious prior to the injection. Within 6-7 min, the patient began to experience difficult breathing at which time 911 was called. The patient was given 1 dose of Epi and one dose of Benadryl IM, which eased severity of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s vital signs remained within normal limits until time of transport to local hospital.

Her whole upper arm became swollen (inflammation) and somewhat &#34;hot to the touch&#34; and was reddish in coloring. The inflammation did NOT look like a golf ball, but rather like a small hill on her upper arm, with a slope. After that, she reported to me .... that she was getting &#34;winded&#34;, on walks with her best friend. They both live in a senior citizen residence center, which is NOT an &#34;assisted living&#34; facility. Now, the swelling (inflammation) is gone. My mother has now had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and yesterday .... she did NOT report, any adverse reactions (yet) from her second injection.
