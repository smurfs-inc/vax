I pulled over and called my husband. I could breathe fine, but the sensation of swelling in my throat was frightening and I felt like I couldnt swallow my saliva. I also had the feeling like I might faint (hot and flushed). This all passed pretty quickly (5 minutes), and I took a benadryl when I got home and rested.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  Approximately 24 hours after injection I felt dyspnea with minimal exertion and at rest while wearing my hospital mask, which I attributed to the cheap quality of the mask.  Breathlessness was relieved after I took it off.  I shoveled snow with no problem over the weekend, and was off work.  Three days later, on 1/3 around 7 pm, I experience the same feeling while wearing the same type of mask, and it was relieve when I took it off.   The following day, 1/4 around 2pm, while wearing a different disposable mask in the grocery store, felt extremely overheated and realized I was having difficulty breathing with minimal exertion.  This time the feeling did not pass when I left the store/removed my mask, and residual effects of not being able to easily take a deep breath stayed with me the entire day.   The feeling was gone in the morning, but did eventually re-occur the next day (tightness in my lungs not allowing for easy deep breaths) on 1/5 near the end of a shift where I had been wearing yet a different type of disposable mask. The symptoms starting around 4:30 pm and lasted throughout the rest of the evening.  At this point I notified employee heath and scheduled a covid test.   The next two days, on 1/6 and 1/7, the same type of dyspnea persisted throughout the day; while at rest, not relieved, and with no other symptoms (no cough, fever, etc.)   Ibuprofen appears to relieve the discomfort, and I have returned to work, however the symptoms are still present if I am not taking Ibuprofen.  Possibly some kind of pleurisy.  My lung sounds are clear.

                                                Received vaccine at 1730, then just before midnight my heart began to pound hard and very fast, and it made me feel short of breath or as though I had to cough. After about a minute I thought it might be SVT so I did a valsalva maneuver and it stopped.  I was resting in bed, no alcohol or caffeine, and this has never happened to me before. Since then, I have felt at least one heart palpitation per day, sometimes many more. The last few days I have felt extremely fatigued and have had an odd sensation in my chest. On 1/7 I developed a dry cough, and was swabbed for Covid because I felt so bad. It was negative. This made me wonder if the odd sensation in my chest was related to my heart and not my lungs. I am due for my second vaccine today, and am unsure if I should get it.

She has had the expected fatigue, muscle aches, headache, chills.   however, she had also developed significant swelling in her left armpit and the swelling has spread into her left chest wall and down into her left ribs. It has also become painful. It?s very painful to lower her arm against her body, to raise her arm above her shoulder, to lift anything, even a bottle of water. It?s also painful to take a deep breathe right in the area on the left chest where the swelling is and into her ribs under her armpit. The area doesn?t seem to be significant red or warm. It is very tender to touch and the swollen area is firm.  It has not responded to ice or NSAIDS. Her shoulder and arm do not seem to have any swelling.&#34;

                                                Prior to 1st Covid vaccination the patient reported a history of mast cell syndrome resulting in numerous anaphylactic events.  The patient had been consulted by her immunologist to proceed with vaccination and due to her history she was observed for a period of 30 minutes.  Upon returning for her 2nd vaccination she reported that she experienced some skin manifestations (hives) but no anaphylactic reaction resulting in difficulty breathing.  She stated that she had discussed this again with her immunologist and she wished to proceed with the 2nd dose and she was prepared to receive EpiPen if necessary if reaction develops.  Within 10 minutes of the vaccination she felt flushing sensation and then itching all over and her &#34;throat closing up&#34;.  She was quickly administered 0.3 mg IM epinephrine and IM diphenyhydramine with some improvement in her symptoms.  While being transported to the ED an additional 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine was administered.  The emergency department also administered the following treatments: famotidine 40 IV x 1 dose, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1 dose, racepinephrine nebulized x 1 dose.  The patient was ultimately discharged approximately 2 hours later with return to her baseline condition.

The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021 for &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;headache&#39; and &#39;anxiety&#39;. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested post-vaccination.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine on Monday 1/4/2021 at 1600. Over the afternoon and evening I developed arm pain at the injection site. Since there were no other side effects in the morning, I returned to work for my regularly scheduled shift on 01/05/2021 at 0545. At approximately 0615 I began to get body aches and restlessness. At approximately 0725 in addition to the body aches and restlessness, I began to get severe nausea, weakness, light-headedness, headache, profuse sweating, and severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Because of the severity of my symptoms my manager immediately told me to go to the ED and a fellow co-worked brought me down via wheelchair. In the emergency department I was assessed and worked up and after several tests and xrays I was given a diagnosis of adverse reaction to drug/vaccine.  I was discharged to home at approximately 1130 on 01/05/2021.  Upon arriving home I continued to have body aches, and then developed chills, shaking and fever of 101.00.  All of this combined became unbearable and I had to take 500mg of Tylenol at 2230 on 01/05/2021. On 01/06/2021 I still felt horrible with body aches, fever, nausea and fatigue.  My weakness, fatigue are still present today 01/07/2021 at 0945.

                                                December 28,(before the vaccine) I was exposed to COVID at work.  I started feeling feverish on Monday at work. I needed to use my inhaler twice that day. I couldn&#39;t stop coughing at work. At home that night - used inhaler again and I had an elevated temperature - 99. something is high for me. I missed work on Tuesday. Couldn&#39;t breathe and it hurt my chest to breathe. My temp was over 100. Dr appt - went to it late afternoon he wanted me test for COVID. Took vitals - mostly normal - temp.; checked OXYGEN - normal. COVID test - was positive. Temperature went to 101 that night - couldn&#39;t breathe good - couldn&#39;t stop shaking; I was aching and I was in pain; I couldn&#39;t feel warm enough. Tried to sleep and drink fluids. Still didn&#39;t have test results from COVID test on Thursday - temp was up to 102 now. The doctor said they couldn&#39;t do anything until they had results back of test. Friday - 101 and 102.8 - temperature that day. After hours clinic - I called them - Dr - I had to gasp for every breath and I was coughing a lot. He prescribed Benzymidate - cough pearls and Azithromycin  - started taking those that night. By Sunday afternoon, my fever continued and I still didn&#39;t have COVID results yet.  My mom took me to  Urgent Care on Sunday - still running fever; he looked at my lungs and listened -  he could hear wheezing and crackling in my lungs - he determined pneumonia - he didn&#39;t know what kind - he gave me Augmentin - he told me to use both my Albuterol inhaler and steriod haler;  Mucinex expectorant twice a day; Vit C and Vit D and Elderberry and Tylenol and two antibiotics. Saturday - before I went to Urgent Care on Sunday - I noticed I couldn&#39;t smell.  Monday is when I got the positive test for COVID.   Provided info to work and I tried to figure out how to work. Even though I was still very sick, I worked again online on Monday. But I couldn&#39;t keep working - got really whoozy; coughing and gasping  felt like I was going to pass out and felt like I could hardly breathe.  My mom called 911 for me. I managed to get to the bathroom - but having trouble breathing and I almost threw up - heard ringing in my ears and room was spinning. There is a lot of things after that I don&#39;t remember - when they moved me to ambulance to hospital  bed I realized I had an IV in me.  They stabilized me. They let me go home. I took the rest of the week off from work. Took a lot of medication and was keeping up with my vital during that week - 99.8 - 102.8 - for ten days I ran that fever. Broke Jan 20th. I went back to work on Jan 25. Still had to use an inhaler a lot. I&#39;m slowly getting taste back; I can&#39;t taste flavor but can taste salt . I&#39;m slowly getting smell back. I still have a lot of congestion but not as bad. Ears were bothering me this weekend so I did go to urgent care on they put me on a third antibiotic for an ear infection. Gave COVID to my son and my mother. Still have trouble catching me breath. January 23  - my isolation was extended to . the county extended my isolation period because of my family getting COVID. I&#39;m about 75% recovered, I&#39;d say.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 40-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL8982), intramuscular at left arm on 21Jan2021 15:38 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Tachycardia (started about 4 years ago), Hypertension (started about 4 years ago) and Essential tremor from 2020 (she has been having symptoms for a while; finally, during the summer of 2020, she was diagnosed through a neurologist) and anxiety, all ongoing; pain, back problems and sleep disorder.Concomitant medications included ongoing Tizanidine as muscle relaxant for back problems, ongoing Metoprolol tartrate for hypertension and tachycardia, Primidone for Essential tremor and ongoing Clonazepam for essential tremors, to help her sleep, and also for anxiety. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient got the first COVID vaccine dose. Afterwards, she went to school and it &#34;was downhill from there&#34;. 5 days of persistent symptoms including sweating, muscle pain, joint pain and left hand swelling. It was further reported that she had to wait 15 minutes and then she drove home which is about a 35-minute drive. So about 45 mins after receiving the vaccine, she noticed her tongue, it was more on the right side of her tongue, she can&#39;t explain the sensation. She couldn&#39;t really taste. Things didn&#39;t taste right to her. This lasted 24 hours. She woke up the next day, 22Jan2021, feeling not quite right. She took some Tylenol that morning and went on into school. She took some ibuprofen in the middle of day, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. She has a history of tachycardia, but her pulse kept reading normal. She had a drink she was drinking from lunch and she ended up having the remainder of it the last few hours of that day. At about the end of her workday, around 15:30 she was finishing the Cdrink off and she said to herself &#34;oh that taste like a regular drink again&#34;. This tongue sensation/lack of taste resolved. At that point, she got really excited because she thought this was all that she would experience with the vaccine. She was grateful she had the chance to have the vaccine. She mentions her arm was very sore right off the bat. She experienced immediate soreness in her arm right after receiving the COVID-19. She thought when they were injecting her, it hit her bone. In fact, she joked about this with the person administering the vaccine. The person at the facility told her to rub it, it actually helps with that. This kind of soreness didn&#39;t seem like a major problem. She was still experiencing this soreness. If she is sitting on the couch sideways, with her side of her arm against the couch, she has pain that extends up into her neck. It was pretty painful. Friday, 22Jan2021 (24 hours later after receiving the vaccine), by the time she got home from work, she was really sore. She had some real muscle pain around her hips and upper thighs, both of them. The soreness extended across. It was like she had inflammation that started flaring up. She felt pretty sore that evening. It wasn&#39;t like a normal muscle soreness. She went to bed because she was pretty tired. The next morning (Saturday, 23 Jan 2021), she couldn&#39;t get off the couch. She had such bad muscle and joint pain. She slept off and on, the pain was pretty bad. Her whole body had so much stiffness and inflammation. Every muscle and every joint just hurt. She confirmed that she hasn&#39;t been able to regulate her body temperature. This has been going on since Saturday evening (23Jan2021). She stated that this wasn&#39;t normal for her. She does take medications to lower heart rate but she hadn&#39;t taken it. She was talking to her best friend about how she had been sore and slept all evening. She checked her pulse and it had dropped down to 40. Her O2 level was at 92. She didn&#39;t think it was that big of a deal. Her best friend was kind of freaking out about it. She had such pain and stiffness in her chest that extended across her shoulders, it made it difficult to breathe. She was laboring to breathe. She checked her pulse thinking maybe she was feeling anxious about it and her HR was up, but it wasn&#39;t. She states happened so bad yesterday, yesterday was worse than before. She got up on Sunday morning, 24Jan2021, and took a hot shower. When the water from the shower head hit her chest, clarified as her upper chest muscles just below her collar bone, the pressure of the water hitting her was painful. However, she was able to get up, she was moving around. Still the whole time. she had this fever-ish feeling. Her kids were telling her that they were sweating because she had the house at 76 degrees. Monday morning, 25Jan2021, she woke up and she was itchy around her left forearm. She was really itching on Friday night, but she didn&#39;t think anything about it. When she took a hot shower yesterday (25Jan2021), a red rash came up on her chest and it looked like she had hives on her forearm. She didn&#39;t know if the hot water flared that up, but she doesn&#39;t have any allergies. She also had gastrointestinal issues. She has had some nausea that has lasted the entire time since she received the vaccine. She clarifies the nausea has came and gone. She hasn&#39;t had much of an appetite. They thought she had a fever yesterday at school. It was 99. something but she had already taken Tylenol a couple hours before and she was sweating so much. She states she has also had diarrhea the last few days, clarified as the last 2 days (24Jan2021). She has already spoken to someone to report her symptoms but wasn&#39;t sure about and had question about getting the second vaccine dose. She reported having gone to Urgent care where she was told she had Post covid vaccine syndrome and that she shouldn&#39;t have a problem with the second dose. She explained she went to the urgent care yesterday, 25Jan2021. She called her doctor that morning and was told to continue to treat her symptoms and take ibuprofen and Tylenol but if she got worse, to go to urgent care. So, she went to the urgent care (Product information for the Tylenol and Ibuprofen she has been taking (Ibuprofen: UPC/NDC: not provided when probed. Lot: P142385 Expiry date: Apr2023 and Tylenol: UPC/NDC: not provided when probed. Lot: P121664 Expiry date: Sep2023). The nurse just explained (Name Withheld) was having the same exact symptoms as the patient, except it was (Name Withheld) second dose. Her symptoms were identical to the patient. The patient wasn&#39;t initially sure if it was from the vaccine or if it was her anxiety. The patient didn&#39;t feel anxious and her heart rate wasn&#39;t up. The patient told she didn&#39;t think anxiety caused her to feel like she had a fever. The school nurse looked it up and found out more symptoms kind of wax and wane. Her symptoms got much worse. On 25Jan2021, Test: Rapid COVID-19 test Result: Negative. The event immediate soreness in arm was not recovered; event couldn&#39;t really taste, things didn&#39;t really taste right to her recovered on 22Jan2021 and nausea recovered in Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021101606 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                Immediately after given vaccine - feeling of lump in throat. Unable to swallow, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, flush feeling, intense shaking (especially in legs), pain in chest, lightheadedness, dizziness (ruled anxiety) and was monitored for 40 minutes. Was given orange juice and water and allowed to remove mask to catch breath. Almost everyday since this event, the same event keeps repeating it self (almost daily for 3 weeks). I am unable to control these episodes. Emergency department (ED) has been called and I have gone to see my nurse practitioner. Been trying to make an appointment with my doctor for this week.  I have lost 5 pounds (down to 105 lbs. so I can&#39;t afford to loose more weight) since this first happened and I have also lost my appetite and unable to function normally.

                                                About 9 hours after vaccine, developed body aches and rigors, low grade temp to ~100.   Fatigued, so went to bed and took ibuprofen.  Continued to have significant body aches and rigors.  While lying in bed, developed nausea.  I got up to go to the bathroom and woke up on the bathroom floor after a syncopal episode.  I returned to bed bed and still felt very lightheaded and laid down.  I had another brief syncopal episode while lying down.  I felt short of breath and had chest tightness when I woke up.  This was around 11pm.  I was evaluated in the ED, where I continued to have body aches and rigors.  I developed fever to 101 and was given Advil and Tylenol as well as IVF.  Symptoms finally resolved.  Had COVID test (which was negative), CBC, chemistries, EKG, chest x-ray, all of which were negative/normal.  Continued to feel significantly fatigued for an additional 48 hours.

I was monitored for 30 minutes by the nurse and as the symptoms were not getting worse she suggested I drive home and take Benadryl. It was a 45 minute drive. Halfway home (about one hour after my shot) I started experiencing itching, swollen tongue, swollen lips. I took 62.5 mg of Children?s Benadryl and met up with my husband and he drove me to the ER, arriving at about 10;15.  After being there about 15 minutes some of my symptoms started going away. At about 11 a rash appeared on my chest. The ER doctors gave me Pepcid 10 mg around 1130 or so. They just charge me and recommended I follow up with my allergy doctor.

It lasted a couple minutes, the pounding of her heart, but it slowed down, it was fast but not as bad, and she took some Benadryl and after a half hour things settled down, her breathing went back to normal. She contacted her doctor who said to let him know if it happened again, and the next day (22Jan2021) she was kind of out of it, lightheaded, foggy, kind of disconnected, almost like a hangover feeling, just yucky and ran down, Saturday she was feeling a little better, then had 2 more episodes of heart pounding and continued shortness of breath. She ended up in the ER with tachycardia on23Jan2021. She is still having problems. In ER, they found out she was anemic on 23Jan2021.On 23Jan2021 they did bloodwork that day, she had an X-ray and EKG. EKG showed fast rate, normal rhythm, appeared to be no damage to heart. Her blood pressure was high and X-ray of lungs was clear, she had another X-ray this morning, since she developed a cough on 30Jan2021, a barky cough, is coughing up phlegm, Cough started on Saturday, this past Saturday, and is ongoing and worsening, it turned into a cough with a whistle into a barky cough, they are thinking it is connected to asthma response. She is supposed to have pulmonary function tests on the 19th and on the 15th, and endoscope and colonoscope due to anemia to ensure no bleed anywhere. They did another X-ray (on 04Feb2021) this morning and it was clear. They only thing they found is she is anemic, and her doctor is wondering if it is underlying asthma or long haul COVID or a combination of anemia and the shot kicked up stuff. It was reported that she had some asthma like symptoms, which were fully resolving, but kicked back up again since the shot. The events were considered as non-serious. The outcome of the event was chills and body aches was recovered, outcome of the event cough was not recovered and outcome of other events was unknown.

At noon I had severe pain the entire length of my right arm, and I felt drowsy so I fell asleep for several hours and the pain in my arm was moderate and restricted to injection sight when I woke up. I went to bed at 10 pm and woke up at 1 am with diarrhea. I spent the the next hour having a few diarrhea bowel movements. On 3/20 my right arm was still in moderate pain and injection site was swollen and red. At 8 am I woke up with a headache and so I went back to bed. By afternoon I had the chills and went to bed for another nap and when I woke up the chills were gone. On 3/21 my right arm still had moderate pain. On 3/22 I had another bout of diarrhea for one bowel movement, and my arm pain was still moderate. On 3/23 the swelling and redness at the injection site went away but the area is still slightly tender to the touch on 3/25. On 3/25 at 1 am I was in bed trying to sleep, but I kept having intense dizzy spells that lasted 3-4 hours.

A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER), first dose at the age of 40-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Mar2021 13:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and known allergies: sulfa from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included rizatriptan; vitamin b complex (VITAMIN B); vitamin c [ascorbic acid]; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported within 10 minutes lips felt numb, swollen. Numbness spread throughout face, checked in with the medic and had vitals checked. Blood pressure was high, and pulse was high. Numbness spread throughout whole face. Ambulance was called and she was transported to the hospital. Within the hour of getting the shot she became unbalanced. She was gasping for air at times and started to feel numb in both arms. Upon arrival to the emergency room her legs started to feel numb. By nightfall she was unable to straighten out my legs. She couldn&#39;t stand up or lift her legs no matter how hard she tried. She was admitted to the hospital. A brain MRI was done and came back normal. Another one may be done. Bloodwork revealed ferritin levels were low and she was getting treatment for that (ferrous sulfate). While sleeping at night she woke up a few times gasping for air feeling like her throat was closing up. Today, she was able to stand up, but unable to stand up straight. She met with physical therapy and is using a walker. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days from 09Mar2021 to 12Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high on 09Mar2021, heart rate: high on 09Mar2021, magnetic resonance imaging brain: normal on 09Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: unknown results on 09Mar2021, serum ferritin: ferritin levels were low on 09Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The patient did not recover from the events.

After a few minutes pulse returned to normal and lightheartedness abated.  At no point did I experience shortness of breath, no facial or airway edema. Just a brief period of tachycardia and feeling of impending doom.

I waited to see if it would go away and then a couple minutes later noticed my lips started itching and swelling and from there it just got worse.  I told the nurse practitioner that I think I was having a reaction, she had me take a seat told her my entire mouth throat &amp; lips felt swollen and itching and she looked and said it was full blown anaphylaxis reaction.  Administered EpiPen, benadryl and called ambulance where they took me to medial emergency department.

                                                Within 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my left arm became very heavy and there was a tingling/neuro sensation in left wrist/hand. A pressure began in the  anterior of my throat which increased gradually. I sought treatment in our Urgent Care just after noon that same day. The Provider monitored my vitals which were good and administered liquid Pepcid. Said Provider chose not to give Benadryl as I had taken Zyrec that morning for my allergies. I was discharged from the Urgent Care and went back to work at 1245. At 1730 hours, I had a slight headache above my right eye and extreme right-sided jaw pain with tooth sensitivity. These lasted for only 10 minutes. At 1830, the anterior and bilateral portions of my throat began to feel &#34;prickly&#34; and I developed a wheeze. I used an albuterol inhaler to relieve the wheeze successfully. At this time I also developed an itchiness throughout my whole body, worse on left side than right side. I took 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. At 0300, I took another dose of 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. I also took an itch pill/antihistamine of my husband&#39;s which provided no relief. At 0800, I took 20 mg of Zyrtec. At 1030, I took 100mg of Benadryl. I continued to use Benadryl throughout the day, every 4-5 hours.  At 1800, I had a fullness in my throat, a tightness in my chest and my left shoulder blade felt almost numb.  I also had a hoarse voice which passed by the next morning. The chest tightness was intermittent over the next day or two.  On Friday, the itchiness had improved some but was still prominent. I continued to use Zyrtec and Benadryl throughout the day. My Primary Doctor called in Prednisone if needed. By Saturday morning, I felt MUCH better. Today is Sunday and I am no longer itching and I feel so much better today.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 06Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history included anaemia and anaphylactic reaction to shellfish. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and had no other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021, within 2 hours (at 12:00 PM), the patient experienced blurred vision, within 4 hours tachycardia and dizziness, within 8 hours headache, chills, body aches, and extreme fatigue, and within 12 hours, tightness in her chest, SOB, extreme fatigue, and body aches. As treatment, the patient received ibuprofen. The patient stated that she had a pretty severe reaction. She also informed her employer but nobody helped. They observed her 15 mins. post-vaccination. She was fine within 15 minutes. It was also reported that within 2 hours, she had blurry vision, tachycardia, and felt dizzy. In the middle of the day, she felt chills, shivers, dizziness, bloating, and headache. The patient also stated that she experienced shakes and taking a shower hurt, also, chest was tight all day. It was further reported that when she was sent back home from work, she started having a severe body ache, fatigue, chills, and shivers. She experienced tightness in her chest , shortness of breath, and she could barely get out of bed. This lasted all day. She still had the blurred vision and couldn&#39;t focus on her cell phone. She felt a little bit better today but was still not 100%. She contacted her MD who advised her to report this to Pfizer. The patient wanted to know if it was safe to receive the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that the events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Outcome of the event &#39;Vision blurred&#39; was not recovered, for the event &#39;Tremor&#39; was unknown, while for the rest of the events was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

                                                Roughly 2-3  minutes post injection as I was sitting in the designated waiting area, (as instructed by the nurse to sit there for 15 minutes post injection to assure no adverse effects) I began to get very short of breath, I felt that I had to take my mask off  to breath properly. ( I did not remove my mask)  My heart then started to race and I felt a warming, tingling feeling throughout my body.  I felt a little hot and light headed.  I stayed sitting in my chair, tried to take some deep breath, and everything went away.  This lasted about 30 to 60 seconds.  I did  NOT report this to anyone there, as I was unsure if I was actually having a reaction or not. Since it went away on it&#39;s own, I did NOT report it to anyone.  I stayed for about 15-20 minutes post injection and then  I left and drove home.  I did feel tired and my arm is sore at injection site, but other than that, no other effects.

                                                The patient self-reported this adverse reaction through the hospital electronic reporting system.  In the patient&#39;s own words, &#34;After receiving the COVID vaccine, I became very dizzy and weak. I felt like I was going to pass out more than once. Arms, legs, hands, and feet tingled, then went numb. Heart started racing, and I felt warm all over. My coworker told me I was very pale. I looked up reactions on the site and decided go to the ER and get checked. On the way over, I become slightly SOB. Once there my BP and HR was elevated, but after about an hour or so returned to normal. I still felt very weak and had some hand and leg tingling&#34;.

Hives went up from my chest to my neck and eventually to my face. About 30 mins after hives started, my breathing became labored. I took 3 Benadryl and was preparing to give my self an EpiPen injection. Benadryl was enough to slowly bring everything back to normal.  This began around 6:00 pm, Benadryl was taken around 6:45, by 9:00pm I was completely normal for bed.

Then about 6 hours same symptoms but without rapid heartbeat, swallowing issues were worse, took Benadryl, after about an hour symptoms lessened and I fell asleep. Next morning roughly 13 hours later would randomly have tightness in face and under chin. Lasted off and on all day.

Following this immunization, she appropriately stayed in the waiting area for the 30 minutes. She then got in car and 15 minutes after, she noticed that her tongue was feeling full/swollen and that was experiencing neck swelling. These symptoms persisted and resembled a prior allergic response to Tetracycline and Aleve. Wheezing and breathing difficulty ensued and EMS was activated.   On arrival to the emergency department she was found to have wheezing with stridor.  A dose of epinephrine was administered and she was monitored in the emergency department with an initial improvement in symptoms. Approximately one hour and 30 minutes after initial epinephrine administration patient reported that she was having continued difficulty swallowing and she was starting to feel a little worse.  At this point a second dose of IM epinephrine was administered.    The patient was subsequently  admitted to inpatient medicine team for further monitoring.

                                                About 45 minutes to an hour after the administration of the vaccine m, my cheeks became red, hot, and swollen. There were also hives. I took Benadryl which stopped the spreading but it did not go away. I had shortness of breath, and by about 6:00 it was hard to breath when lying down. I did an albuterol treatment with my nebulizer. It helped but it took much longer than usual. There were was about 30 minutes that I found my epipen and was going to the ED if it got worse.  My breathing improved. The red changed to pink but was still swollen and tight 7 hours later. The second one of Benadryl helped get rid of most of the pinkness. When I woke up this morning, I had a little bit of a wheezy cough that I didn?t have yesterday.  My daily Zyrtec and singular helped that a little. I have new hives along my jawline this morning that are very minor but they do itch. The redness and swelling was similar to reactions I?ve gotten when I drink a beer or have eaten soft shell crab, but typically Benadryl will clear that up and it doesn?t linger for so long.  This was more aggressive. My side effects at this point are minor, but I have a call in to my allergist to see if I should be doing anything different and questions about the second dose.

Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

After about thirty more seconds I had trouble breathing and eventually could barely breathe. My face was puffy and my eyes started to close.  I received IV Benadryl and two other medications which I can&#39;t remember.

                                                Patient felt faint nearly immediately after but said she wasn&#39;t having problems breathing.   She was told to breath deeply and she quickly started feeling &#34;a little better&#34; so she was helped to a chair with arm rests in the room.  She said she had an orange in her bag, so she started eating her orange.  Just a minute later she said she was going to pass out, so the pharmacist caught her.  He held her up in the chair and tried to revive her for a few moments but noticed that the blood was draining from her face and her lips were turning blue so yelled for one of his technicians to call 911 and the other to grab an epi pen.  He then lowered her to the floor in case he needed to begin to resuscitate while the technician brought him the epipen.  While lowering her she urinated on herself.  As the pharmacist went to check her vitals before administering the epipen and beginning cpr if necessary the patient suddenly gasped once and her eyes opened widely, but not continue to breath.  Upon inspection in her mouth there was a piece of orange near the bottom of the throat.  The pharmacist asked if she was choking and she did not response at all, but did not start visibly breathing either.  So the pharmacist swiped the piece of orange out quickly, in case it was either previously lodged or patient would have to be resuscitated.  She did not seem to enjoy this and this seemed to wake her up and she quietly gasped not choking.  She started to quickly improve and admitted that she was feeling better, and had passed out before after getting blood drawn but never after a shot so didn&#39;t mention this.  While this was happening a police office was going through the drive through so the technician called him in for assistance and he arrived around this time.  He asked her a few questions like &#34;what&#39;s her name, who&#39;s president, how many quarters are in a dollar&#34; which she was able to answer.  She said she was mostly embarrassed and was feeling much better.  She sat up in the chair again about the time the emts came in.  The checked her out, but she didn&#39;t want to go to the Emergency Room.  She was driven home by her father.  I called her later around 6 pm that night and she said she was feeling totally fine and I advised her to please call her PCP and discuss this incident with him or her.

                                                Within an hour of receving the vaccine, I became dizzy, had face tingling and arm tingling and felt mentally foggy.  As the day progressed, I felt a fullness in my throat and fatigue.  Over the next week, the dizziness became worse, I experienced intense headaches and shortness of breath for several days. I had difficulty sleeping and vivid dreams.  I have had thyroiditis twice in my life after giving birth to my 2 children with similar dizziness and throat fullness.  I decided to contact my doctors and had my thyroid levels checked.  My TSH was abnormal and my doctor thinks I could be having another episode of thyroiditis.  My menstrual cycle arrived a week early.  Following this, I continued to have dizziness, throat fullness, and intense headaches.  I developed sore breasts and breast discharge as well as in increase in frequency of urination.  I decided to postpone the second shot until I was feeling better as past episodes of thryoiditis took about 2 months to resolve.  My next menstrual period was a week late, also accompanied by mood swings, breast tenderness and intense headaches.  SIx weeks later, I continue to experience occasional dizziness and throat fullness and increased urination.  Prior to the vaccine, I was feeling fine and it seems like the vaccine triggered some kind of hormone/endocrine response in my body.  I have not had reactions to any vaccines prior to this.  I am quite hesitant to receive the second vaccine and am wondering if I should wait a period of time and try something  different such as the Johnson and Johnson one.  I? not quite sure what in the Pfizer vaccine ( perhaps the mRNA?) could have triggered this reaction in my thyroid and endocrine system. and would appreciate guidance on what to do next as I would like to be fully protected from COVID-19 but do not want to endure these unusual side effects.

After 15 minutes &#34;throat clearing&#34; started and between 25-30 minutes my throat got &#34;thick&#34; and my body began tingling all over.   My breathing became labored and difficult, my lips were numb.   I was immediately administered an EPI pen, and was transported by ambulance to the ER .  I was also treated with albuterol, solumedrol, and benedryl.  I remained in the ER for the entire day, and was discharged in the evening.  I was prescribed Claritin, and prednisone, and given an epi pen.  I followed up with my doctor on the following Monday, still experiencing chest pressure and numbness/tingling in my throat/face.  The Claritin was continued, and the prednisone was extended.  I followed up with another doctor on Wednesday as symptoms were not resolved.  Claritin has been increased and am trying to phase out the prednisone. I continue to suffer from tingling in my lips, and chest pressure.  Doctors have no idea how long symptoms would last.

                                                Short Summary: DVT followed by Multiple Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms (significant blood clots in both lungs). Context: After the first vaccine (about a week before my second vaccine), I self diagnosed myself with a calf injury due to extreme pain in my calf that felt like a continuous cramp. The extreme pain lasted until my second shot (about a week). When going for my second shot, I reported a rash with hives on my lower abdomen that had appeared within five hours of my first shot, so they requested I stay a little longer for observation. That night I began having some breathing difficulties, but assumed they were to be expected. The breathing difficulties continued to get worse until my nurse practitioner told me to go directly to the nearest ER (2/16/21), where I was officially diagnosed with multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms. I was admitted to healthcare facility for 24-48 hours, until an EKG revealed heart abnormalities that caused them to use a physician&#39;s transport to move me to another unit. I was discharged from the hospital on 2/2/21 after I stabilized from heparin shots, avoiding more invasive procedures. I have been in ongoing recovery since then, receiving ongoing care from a hematologist and pulmonologist. A little extra context for you - I arrived to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis and have an endocrinologist since hospitalization that has diagnosed me with Type 1 Diabetes (previously misdiagnosed as type 2 - I&#39;m now on insulin which is controlling my blood glucose well).

                                                About 5 minutes after the shot, I started to feel a tightness in my throat.  It lasted a couple of minutes and then passed. Then about 45 minutes after I started to feel a heaviness/ache in my upper chest. This feeling continued for days. Around day four I began to have a feeling of great pressure in my throat, particularly when swallowing. I noticed that my heartrate was elevated, but that might have been because the feeling was very stressful.  The feeling would increase when I turned my head to the side or put my chin down.This feeling persisted for 3 days. After three days the feeling changed slightly and started feeling more like the sensation one gets when you have food stuck in your throat. As I type this, it is 8 days after the vaccine and I still feel this sensation in my throat.

                                                After receiving the vaccination, when I stood up I felt a rush to my head. I went to sit in the waiting area to be monitored and my tongue and lip started itching. I then started w/ a red rash to the R side of my neck. My body started to itch all over.  I was brought into a treatment room and my vital signs were being taken when I started to have an increase in coughing, shortness of breath and vomiting. I was given an epipen and brought to the emergency room when I received Benadryl 50mg IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV. Approximately 1 hour after receiving the medication my face again began to itch and I was given an additional dose of 25mg of Benadryl. My reaction resolved and I was discharged home with a prescription for prednisone.

A 42-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 31Dec2020 at 10:15 AM, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthma, allergy, hypothyroidism, and some fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks). Patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant. On 31Dec2020, after ten-15 minutes (10:30 AM) of receiving the vaccine, she was light headed and dizzy with some nausea. Monitored in the emergency room (ER) with high BP 140&#39;s and heart rate (HR) 110s to 120s. After an hour of saline bolus, she was better but she got nasal congestion and swelling of the face with sore throat. On 01Jan2021, after 24 hours, she got some soreness at the injection site with generalized body aches. Also she got some shortness of breath which lead to her asthma attack and difficulty sleeping. On 02Jan2021, after 48hours, she was feeling still light headed with some sore throat, chills, body aches and severe headache which lead her to go to the ER and got herself tested for flu, covid and strep, which came back all negative but her signs and symptoms (s/sx )still after discharge was getting worst especially the headache and generalized body aches. As well as congestion and sore throat. The patient had given &#34;Ivf&#34; for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The fire fighters asked the nursing staff for Benadryl they advised they did not carry it and could not give it to me. I carry Benadryl in my work bag due to my list of allergies. Fire assisting at location advised me to take Benadryl. I notified my employer because Benadryl makes me sleepy. They sent me home and I continued Benadryl and missed work for three days. At this time I went to prestige emergency  about 1200 pm because the hives, heat in my body did not go away.  I was treated and placed on an iv cocktail and sent home with several medications.

Remained in the observation room symptom-free for additional 30 minutes.   At home, symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness returned and worsened.  Throat felt tight, able to move air, however had trouble swallowing.  Voice was raspy and increased coughing.  From past experience with allergy shots, this was my cue to use epi pen.  Within 5 minutes after using epi pen, all symptoms were resolved.

Her arm had a hard, red, hot spot for approximately a week.  At this time I told her we would like her to stay under observation for 30  Min instead of the normal 15 min. At approximately 25 min post vaccination, the pt reported the following: &#34;arm felt heavy, both arms did, but more so the affected arm, instant headache, sore neck, vision went fuzzy, breathing wasn&#39;t difficult but felt labored, throat felt like it was closing/congested, rash on the inside of the affected arm&#34;.    Pt stated that her heart felt like it was &#34;pounding&#34;.    VS:  162/96, 99% RA, HR in the 70&#39;s.    Patient was administered 50ml IM diphenhydramine and monitored for 90 minutes in the clinic area.  Dr. was consulted and also spoke with the pt, advising her to continue with OTC diphenhydramine once at home.     The symptoms resolved after approximately 40 minutes.  By 17:00 the patient was deemed stable to go home with the instructions to go immediately to ED should any further Sx present.  It was verified that she did not live alone and would have someone with her that could assist.    Pt was subsequently followed up with a phone call on the next day by RN who relayed that she was very tired, but no other complications.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

                                                Patient was administered 2nd vaccine on 1-8-21 by a nursing student.  During 15 observation period, arm began to feel cold at injection site area. At that point the patient realized the vaccine was given toward the back of upper left arm near the fatty tissue instead of toward the middle of the arm. Approximately 20 min after vaccine administration,  patient became short of breath, dizzy,  light headed, and throat felt a little swollen and almost passed out. A rapid response was called and the patient was seen by Occupational Health. The patient&#39;s BP and heart rate were elevated but normalized during observation in Occupational Health. At this time, the patient did not feel they needed to be seen in the emergency department. The patient was discharged home at this time.  12 hours after the shot, the patient began experiencing normal side effects from the vaccine. The nursing student was informed of administration at the incorrect site.

I went home from work and became itchy to my neck and arms .  At about 20 hours later I became short of breathe and pulse standing would go up to 140. I rested and continued taking Motrin and Tylenol as suggested . I ate minimally despite nausea .  I messaged my Dr the next AM.  By that time my glucose was settling down to normal and my Bp and pulse . The headache got worse and I had a pain in my axilla on the same arm I received the vaccine. I developed ?lymphadema? in that area which is sore to touch or move my arm. I reached out to infectious disease Dr at the hospital I work at and he suggested to continue Tylenol and Motrin and wait a week as this is due to vaccine.  It is now Day 3 following vaccine and I am yet unable to work. My arm and axilla area is sore and I can?t lift my arm without pain, I have headaches  and nausea as well.

A 42-years-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899, expiration date: unknown), intramuscular on the right arm on 29Dec2020 at 09:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and high blood pressure. The patient had no known allergies, is not pregnant and had no COVID prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included vitamin C [Ascorbic Acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]), vitamin D3 (VITAMIN D3), bromelains (BROMELAIN), quercetin (QUERCETIN), zinc (ZINC), acetylcysteine (NAC [ACETYLCYSTEINE]) and Probiotic.  The patient had no other vaccines in four weeks. On 06Jan2021 at 21:00, the patient experienced chills all day but no fever. Around 9pm, her heart rate shot up to the 120s and she had chest pressure and felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe every time she stood up. When she laid down, it was better. These lasted about 3 hours. She had some very mild shortness of breath twice after this on the 7th and 9th, but it was not nearly as bad as on the 6th. The patient did not take any medication when these happened. The patient tested for COVID post-vaccination (07Jan2021) through COVID-19 PCR (Nasal Swab) which resulted negative. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was administered for the events. The events resolved on an unknown date in Jan2021.

                                                Allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s spouse). A 42-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 14Jan2021 15:00 at a single dose in a hospital for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to sulfur and latex. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took dexamethasone (DECADRON) and experienced allergy. The patient had Covid vaccine at the hospital yesterday (14Jan2021) about 3pm and around 315-320, she had an allergic reaction. The patient was given epinephrine and stuff like that but ended up having to call an ambulance and took to another hospital. There, they had to put her in ICU and on a ventilator. The patient&#39;s spouse asked what might have been in the product that she would have been allergic to. The patient was transferred to hospital. She is a respiratory therapist. The patient was treated with epinephrine, albuterol and she was put on a bi-pap but she couldn&#39;t breathe and was told by the doctors that her body can&#39;t take it so they intubated her about 7:30 pm, she was put on a ventilator. The patient had an emergency visit. The patient had no prior vaccination (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

All of Saturday these symptoms went on and I had a tightness in my throat, not pain.  I was very delirious and speaking jibberish when awake.  Sunday the fever lessened and I felt more alert, but a large swelling started in my armpit in the left arm.  Monday the fever was gone but I still had major joint pain, off and on headache and overall sick feeling.  Today I woke and have a very upset stomach and achy feeling all over.  The lump in my arm pit has gotten smaller but is still painful and visible.

A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EN5318) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 15:15 in right deltoid at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The outcome of the events was recovering.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk.

My neck and upper back became stiff and painful. Then came chills, shaking, and more nausea. My throat felt like there was a lump in it that was closing me off. I  felt very weak and easily fatigued. I started to have visual issues, confusion, and was unable to focus. Neck pain continued to be severe. The next morning I woke feeling good, but within 2 hour again I went downhill. Symptoms are only about half as bad as the day before. Very very tired.

I saw the cardiologist who believed it to be sinus tackycardia as a result as an AE to  vaccine.  Felt as if my face and lips were swelling  so I took benedry and laid down again and the next morning  when I woke up and my face and lips were super swollen.

This 43-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), (Lot number: EL1285) via intramuscular route on 29Dec2020 14:30 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: Negative and Pixel: Negative on 08Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events including stroke, dizzy/lightheaded/felt like fainting, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and sudden loss of hearing to right, and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the patient&#39;s underlying medical conditions, relevant lab tests would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

She presented to the ED at 0833 short of breath with a dry cough and hoarse voice. She was given albuterol then monitored and re-evaluated at 0921. At that time the patient stated that she felt a little better, and declined any further evaluation since she reported that she felt the same as she always does while having an asthma attack. She states that she would not have come to the ER if she had not been at work and been required to. She was discharged with prednisone at 0923.

Vitals stable, pulse ox 100%, pharynx clear without edema and no wheezing.  However she was quite distressed, becoming diphoretic, and stating that breathing and throat constriction was worsening. She was treated with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM left thigh and 25mg Benadryl left deltoid.  After treatment breathing improved, throat constriction resolved, and she felt a rapid heart rate and dizziness.  These also gradually improved and she was discharge home with her husband, with prescriptions for famotidine, loratadine, to not take metformin today, and strict ED precautions for recurrence of breathing or throat constriction symptoms.

                                                I?m still not sure what to make of my reaction. Started to feel ?out of body?, slow and had left-sided chest pain at around 8 minutes after administration. Then flagged down a nurse. They checked my blood pressure at 196/110 (first one may have been 210/110)- I was sort of disoriented. Sat there for about an hour with repeated blood pressure checks, until my pulse went from 118 down to 90. They let me go home at 170/100. I do t have hypertension. Then went and laid down in my office nearby and my left upper arm turned bright red and became painful and slightly swollen. Took five hours for my blood pressure to drop to 118/80- my normal is 114/78. Still have weird chest pain and some SOB with exertion (not normal for me).

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, my throat started feeling really thick - hard to breathe. Felt like I was wheezing. Super shaky and dizzy. I gave myself my epi-pen. I notified them and they took me to ER - IV - Benadryl and Solumedrol . I got really shaky for about an hour afterwards and then they discharged me. It cleared up my throat issues. within 4 days, I had significant shortness of breath again and I was directed to ER Gave me evaluated me for a pulmonary embolism - I did not have one. They gave me Solumedrol again. They gave me a prednisone taper. And then a week after that - or two weeks after - the shortness of breath returned  - Dr had me go to ER room again - They gave me another prednisone taper which I&#39;m still on and I have significant fatigue still and 24/7 out of breath still. Currently: Flonase 50 mg - twice a day - Admerdiscus 100 mg  - twice a day

Pt also states her concern for blood clot (mother had DVT in her 30s). She presented with moderate chest pain and tightness, as well as headache, weakness, SOB. Pt given APAP 1000 mg PO x 1, ibuprofen 800 mg PO x 1, orphenadrine 100 mg PO x 1. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL x 1 ordered, but not given on MD&#39;s orders. Pt discharged home.  1/22/21: Pt f/u with hospital. DO says her elevated WBX and Cr were likely d/t vaccine and dehydration. DO offered to schedule f/u BMP and CBC on Monday 1/25. Pt also scheduled for outpt fluids at infusion center on Monday 1/25 in case BMP and CBC still indicate dehydration.

                                                Starting on February 24, 2021, I started to have shortness of breath. This slowly got worse until on March 2, 2021 I was unable to breathe in all the way and was getting a sharp pain in my side/back when I tried to breathe in more than half way. I then went to the emergency room recognizing the symptom as likely being a pulmonary embolism, as I had experienced one four years earlier. It was, in fact, a PE. I was in the hospital for five days as they treated the clots with blood thinners. I slowly got my breathing more back to normal and was discharged. They are still runnying myriad tests to try to determine the cause or causes, but I thought it wise to report here in case the vaccine is a factor. I received my second dose on 2/26/21, a few days before I went to the hospital but my symptoms started a few days before that.

                                                After the first injection, I noticed mild mouth tingling, but nothing else, did not report as it was so mild and it was more notable in retrospect.  A week after the first injection developed vertigo for the first time in my life.  This lasted about a week had mostly resolved when I got the second dose.  Immediately upon receiving the second dose I felt faint.  I went to the observation area and when the feeling got stronger, reported it.  My blood pressure was taken and although I always have normal blood pressure, it was extremely high - 195/100.  My heart was racing.  I was observed for longer because of this, and was asked to lie down.  The faint feeling and high blood pressure lasted 30 min, at which time it started to improve and was sent home.  I persisted in having bouts of feeling faint (but never fainting) in the days and weeks following, joined with shortness of breath which started the second day after the second injection. I also had the normal fever, aches and pains for 4 days.  It is now a month after the second injection, and while the faintness and vertigo are mostly gone,  I have persistent shortness of breath.  Prior to the vaccine I had an albuterol inhaler that I would use 1-5 times a year for allergies.  Almost never used it.  I began having to use it multiple times daily after the second dose of the vaccine.  I am not on a steroid inhaler.  I have never had shortness of breath like this before.  I was examined at the doctors office, not much can be seen that is wrong.   An allergist believes that I did not have an allergy because my blood pressure was high instead of low as in anaphylaxis.

The patient has not been tested with COVID-19 post vaccination. It was reported that, she was calling about the COVID-19 vaccine. She received the vaccine yesterday at 8:45 AM, then at 12:30 PM she began to have a rapid pulse and high blood pressure. She went to the ER because of her pulse and blood pressure. In the ER, she received an IV to calm the heart, she doesn&#39;t know what was in the IV. They did blood work and told her the blood work was fine, and the chest X-ray was fine. She went to a Cardiologist today, she does have a valve prolapse, but she has had no issues with that for many years. She states that her body had a weird response to the covid vaccine. Caller states that she need Pfizer to know what happened because it was real scary. She has her first dose on 01Feb2021 at 8:45 AM. The rapid pulse began while she was sitting at the computer working. Her heart was pounding on 01Feb2021, she couldn&#39;t catch her breath on 01Feb2021, and so she was a school teacher, so then she went to find the nurse, and even in that she was having trouble catching her breath to be able to even talk. The nurse took her into the office, and she put a pulse ox monitor on her finger. At 12:25 PM her pulse was 177, at 12:30 PM her pulse was 163 with blood pressure 167/93, at 12:40 PM pulse 116, blood pressure 144/95. The nurse then called the ambulance because it was alarming. Caller states that doesn&#39;t know what her readings were in the ambulance. She went to the ER at (institute name withheld) and they did an EKG, 2 of them. The regular ER doctor was not super helpful, he said that she was okay to take the second vaccine. Caller did not agree with him thinking that the 1st covid vaccine sent her to the ER. HCP: He was at (institute name withheld) Cardiology. He did an EKG today (on an unspecified date in Feb2021), she doesn&#39;t know results at the moment. He didn&#39;t say if it was normal or abnormal. They did an echocardiogram, she was also assuming nothing was alarming or she would have been told the results. He listened to the heart and said it sounded fine, there was nothing he could detect. She did have a rapid heart rate at the cardiologist office, both pulse and blood pressure were elevated. He said that she was going to do a stress test in a week, the doctor was also going to see what the blood work from the ER yesterday looks like, he would also check the thyroid. He told her that next week she would also wear a heart monitor. She was at the doctor&#39;s office today at 10:30 AM. Her biggest concern was which she talked to the cardiologist today about was the 2nd dose of the vaccine. She doesn&#39;t want a repeat of this event. The cardiologist said that she was supposed to get the second dose in 3 weeks, let&#39;s do testing and see where we stand. Her 2nd dose was scheduled for 22Feb2021. She was concerned this happened. She doesn&#39;t know what could be done. This was bizarre. In the ER, the doctor said this wouldn&#39;t be considered an allergic reaction. Caller wonders what this was considered then. The ER doctors thing was that this didn&#39;t happen in first 15 to 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, and that would be considered an allergic reaction if it did. She wants to know if this was an allergic reaction. Enquired was this allergic reaction. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. She has no results for the tests that were performed at the ER, she was just told the chest X-ray was normal and so was the blood work, but she doesn&#39;t know what the blood work involved. They were looking for blood clots at the ER. She was not admitted into the hospital, she was sent home the same day. She has had no positive COVID test prior to the vaccine. She also has had no symptoms, and therefore no reason to get tested either. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab tests and procedure which included chest X-ray: Normal, pulse rapid: 177 (at 12:25 PM), pulse rapid: 163 (at 12:30 PM), blood pressure: 167/93 (at 12:30 PM), pulse rapid: 116 (at 12:40 PM), blood pressure: 144/95 (at 12:40 PM). On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work: Unknown results (the doctor was also going to see what the blood work from the ER yesterday looks like. They were looking for blood clots at the ER), EKG: Unknown results, EKG: Unknown results, Echocardiogram: Unknown results. The patient was treated with IV for the adverse events. The outcome of the events she couldn&#39;t catch her breath, her heart was pounding was unknown and not recovered for the other events.

A non-pregnant 43-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Feb2021 at 18:00 (at the age of 43 years old) (Lot Number: EM9809, unknown expiration) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included penicillin allergy.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient also received first dose of BNT162B2 on 23Jan2021 at 18:00 (at the age of 43 years old) (lot number: EL3247, unknown expiration) in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. After the second shot, the patient did notice swollen lymph nodes on 02Apr2021 for several days.  She noticed her breathing labored while walking or doing activity on 02Apr2021 after getting the second shot. In 8 weeks, the patient went to the ER and found that she had fluid built up around heart and lungs which started on 02Apr2021.  They also found in a CT scan that lymph nodes were enlarged slightly and that the patient&#39;s white blood count was elevated on 02Apr2021. After an echocardiogram on 02Apr2021, they determined that the patient&#39;s heart was weak and only working at 29% percent.  The patient has had no prior history of heart problems or was taking any medications. The patient was given many heart medications to strengthen the heart and treatment for the events. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient has no COVID and was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab on 10Apr2021 with negative result. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalization) for 8 days.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

Then, I started to feel kind of lightheaded and my legs were weak. I let the staff know and they offered me benadryl but I declined. I waited about 35 minutes then I went home. I continued to feel lightheaded and weak for about 4 hours and I also began to fill nauseous. My arm continued to be sore for a few days and I ran a fever of around 100 from the following day 1/9 and I am still running a fever now on 1/12.

                                                throat closing up; struggled the breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 44-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Pfizer EL 3302), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 07:30 am at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure, allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 10Jan2021 14:30, patient woke up with throat closing up and struggled the breath. Patient immediately drank a dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Patient did that two more time in the evening of 10Jan2021. Patient called the doctor in the morning. Events were considered serious per life-threatening. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient received treatment liquid diphenhydramine hydrochloride, epinephrine (EPI-PEN) for events. Outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.

                                                2nd shot: Very different experience. Got the shot in my left arm after work like before. I had a headache and felt tired so took some melatonin, had a hot toddy, and went to bed early. Woke up roughly 18 hours post vaccine with back aches and lower rib pain when I took a breath. Took my temp, it was 100*.  By 21 hours I had a temp of 102*.  My groin, neck, and left arm pit lymph nodes were enlarged as well. After sleeping most of the day away, it felt like my fever &#39;broke&#39; at 28 hours, it came down to 101*.  Finally I took some Tylenol at 34 hours so I could sleep from the back pain.  Woke up the next morning at 45 hours with a stiff back/neck but temp down to 99*.  I also had a swollen and reddened entire deltoid where the shot had been given (painless when shot given and no blood after), almost like a cellulitis or allergic reaction.  My left armpit lymph node remains enlarged but not as painful. Now almost 72 hours out, the only residual effects are a decreasing but enlarged left armpit lymph node, improving swollen/reddened deltoid, decreased appetite, and decreased energy level.

A 44-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot ek9231) on 08Jan2021 03.00 pm intramuscular in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included RA, spondylitis, GERD, known allergies to sulfa, penicillin, cefalexin monohydrate (KEFLEX), sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM), adalimumab (HUMIRA), ankylosis. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), omeprazole, loratadine (CLARITIN) and infliximab (RENFLEXIS). First dose of BNT162B2 was administered on 21Dec2020 11:00 am (lot ek5730) intramuscular in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Approx 34 hours after vaccine (also reported as 03Jan2021) awoke unable to breath. Symptoms consistent with laryngospasm, symptoms lasted approx 2 minutes. No treatment provided. No COVID test performed prior or after vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of unable to breath/ Laryngospasm cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of allergic reaction to vaccine.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient). A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ( COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EK9231, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mild sleep apnea. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. On 09Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site pain and arm soreness on day 1 and day 2, patient was also very tired on day 1. Patient also had occasional sneezing and mild headache since day 1. On day 2, energy level was back to normal. However, on 11Jan2021, on day 3, the patient started to develop occasional shortness of breath and continued today, day 7. The shortness of breath comes and goes. On 14Jan2021, on day 6, the patient experienced occasional coughing and continued today, day 7. Since the patient was working in a pharmacy, she cannot rule out if symptoms were from vaccine or Covid exposure, so patient decided to get Covid test done today, day 7. The patient had no treatment received for the events. The patient had no other vaccine in 4 weeks and no other medications in 2 weeks. Patient had no Covid prior vaccination and was Covid tested post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab with pending results on 14Jan2021.

She is able to breathe without difficulty.  She will take 50 mg Benadryl and if symptoms progress she will go to the ER for further treatment and evaluation of an allergic reaction to COVID vaccine.  She will call Dr. back later and may need note for work.  2/26 11:30 AM  Received text message from patient.  &#34;I woke up with trouble breathing, hives on my neck and jaw and swollen face.  Nausea and diarrhea.  Trouble swallowing so I took Benadryl.  Swelling went down on face but still tight in throat.  . Dr. &#34;instructed her to go to ER if symptoms worsen and told her I would check on her on Monday.  I asked her if her symptoms were not changed, worse, or improved.  She answered:  &#34;They got worse this am from 5 to 10 and feeling better now.  As far as swelling and breathing feels better.  3/1 10:21 AM  Dr. Spoke with patient 10:21 am.  She states that she is feeling much better and no longer has difficulty breathing or feeling of throat tightness.  She does still have nausea, with occasional vomiting, and diarrhea.  She felt well enough to return to work today.    3/3 11:09 AM  Dr. spoke with patient.  She stated that she is finally feeling &#34;back to normal&#34;.  We discussed severity of side effects and recommendation to defer 2nd Pfizer vaccination.  She stated that at one point she was &#34;close to going to the ER&#34;.

                                                Within a minute of getting the vaccine, my throat closed off. I could still breathe, but it was hard. I also felt a strange sensation in my chest (this latter sensation I only remember feeling twice). The difficulty breathing came and went for about 15-30 minutes. The EMS was called, and they took my blood pressure, blood oxygen level, and listened to my lungs, heart, and throat. They said they sounded normal. After this, I waited at a parking lot for another 15-20 minutes. I felt a bit strange, but I could breathe better. They did not inject the EPI Pen.

                                                Felt very dizzy and chest started to hurt. I was very thirsty and my mouth felt like it was full of cotton. My lips swelled. This happened within a few minutes of getting the vaccine. I was already being observed in a 30 minute seat, 20-30 minutes were added and three different professionals addressed the issue including a nurse practitioner. About 20 minutes after leaving the facility, about 1.5-2 hours after getting the vaccine, I noticed I was easier to breathe and I hadn?t realized how much my tongue and inside of mouth had been swollen previously. After these 2 hours, I felt fine. The following day I experienced a headache and was tired. Otherwise was fine.

At which time it seemed to dry up what ever nasal mucus I had.  Almost immediately I felt dizzy  and light headed.  Then came the  my heart beating faster.  My breathing quickened cold sweats began with the palms of my hands.  This continued for about 3-4 minutes.  When my heart/ blood pressure seemed to go back to normal, I sat for an additional 15 minutes.   I had 3 more incidents that day of dizzy and lightheadness throughout the day but not to the extent of the initial, almost passing out, spell. For 12 hours after injection,  other than the typical reported symptoms of  sore arm, fatigue which I did experience,  i felt like I was in a haze, similar to when you have a fever for 11 hours.  And oddly, almost immediately the haze and fatigue lifted.  No other adverse reactions after that.

Was advised to pull over and await for ambulance. Ended up at ER with elevated heart rate, chest pain and feeling winded. I could breath ok no swelling in throat but just felt like a elephant was on my chest

                                                12 minutes after receiving the vaccine my throat started feeling tight. I waited 1 minute to make sure it wasn?t going to go away. I motioned for the security officer to come over so I could tell him my throat felt tight, I was dizzy and lightheaded. He called for a nurse.  Several people came over to check on me, take my vitals, ask questions and administer an EpiPen. They noticed I was very pale. I felt better for about 1 min but symptoms came back. An ambulance was dispatched. They came and took vitals as well. I was then loaded into the ambulance and transported to the hospital. Vitals were again taken. I was monitored and blood was drawn. Blood work came back that I had low potassium so I was given an infusion of that. I was sent home with a script for Famotidine 20mg, Fexofenadine 180mg and Klor-Con M20. Around 7:45pm I felt my throat tightening again so I took the 2 meds for the allergic reaction. Throat still feels tight at 8:57pm but not as bad as it did at 7:45pm.

She was treated with benadryl and albuterol and sent home after improvement.  After going home, continued to have some lip/throat swelling. She then presented to local hospital with worsened symptoms, treated with benadryl and steroids, given a script for prednisone, and sent home.  She did not fill the prednisone script initially, but had some prednisone (unknown strength) at home and took a pill.  The following morning (3/26), she continued to have throat and lip swelling and began to develop some dyspnea. Due to these worsening symptoms, she came to ED.  She received a total of 5 doses of IM epinephrine (1734, 1938, 2010, 2320, 0017) along with IV pepcid and IV solumedrol for persistent subjective throat swelling, dyspnea, and difficulty tolerating secretions.  She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of symptoms and consideration of an epinephrine drip, but did NOT require this.  In the morning of 3/27, she noted substantial improvement in symptoms of tongue/lip swelling, improved wheezing, dyspnea, and dysphagia. Still with some mild hoarseness that she attributes to cough, also improving.

I checked into a Medical Center ER  when I was having the attack and I couldn&#39;t control my breathing body aches  - and they gave me anti-nausea medicine. A few days after that I was non stop throwing up -  I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I was still having intermittent vomiting - about once a week - and I&#39;d have to take off work. This kept happening up until about a month ago (with the vomiting).  It was horrible. I had headaches, too - they weren&#39;t major but were bothersome - I had them for about three weeks and then they went away.  A couple of weeks later - I was still throwing up and I went to ER - but I don&#39;t remember the date of second visit - they gave me IV and Zofran. I had stomach pain from the vomiting.  I was admitted into hospital last week - the 18th and was discharged the next evening. I was using inhaler every day for two times a day. They dosed me with a lot of antibiotics  - IV antibiotics and also Steroids - Zumatrol and they sent me home with doxycycline HIC 100 mg and those were for 10 days; twice a day; and I haven&#39;t been needing my inhaler since last Friday.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm at age 44 years on 27Jan2021 15:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included alopecia and known allergies to peanuts. Patient is not pregnant. Patient had not had COVID prior vaccination. Concomitant medication(s) included ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN), spironolactone, VIT D, zinc, and biotin, taken on unspecified dates for an unspecified indication. Patient previously took dose 1 of BNT162B2 lot number= EL3246 on 08Jan2021 with administration time at 04:15 pm, vaccine location on the left arm. On 29Jan2021, 2 days after the vaccine, patient started feeling short of breath, tachycardia, fatigue, and upper back/left scapula pain. Patient thought she had some side effect that eventually would go away. By 02Feb2021, she felt worsening tachycardia, fatigue and shortness of breath. Patient went to (Hospital name withheld) and they did a COVID 19 test on Feb2021. The test was negative but they found that she was very tachycardic and EKG changes (ST depression). Then, patient underwent a cardiac catheterism and a CT angio of the chest and both were negative. Patient was discharged 24 hours later still tachycardic up to are of 110s. As outpatient, patient underwent echocardiogram and was negative as well. Patient  saw her cardiologist on 19Mar2021 and it seems that the tachycardia resolved along with her fatigue and upper back pain. All these symptoms gradually improve over time. She still have the ST depressions on her EKG but she was asymptomatic. No one was sure if she had any sort of immunologic reaction to the vaccine. AE resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization. Treatment was heparin, aspirin and ticagrelor (BRILINTA).  The outcome of the event EKG changes (ST depression) was not recovered, while for the rest of the events, it was recovered on 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

Felt like circulation was cut off. Severe Shortness of breath. Extreme feeling of adrenaline. The next day on March 14th, had extreme vaginal bleeding on day 14 of cycle. Bled for another 7 days which led to extreme anemia. The shortness of breath is every day since the first dose. Heart palpitations (heart rate went up to 190!). After the second dose on 4/03, all symptoms got worst. Left leg went completely numb the same day which I went to the emergency room for. The neurological tingling and numbness was spreading to my whole body. Arms, legs, face, ears, scalp, inside my head. I was worried for a heart attack since all of my symptoms of left arm and shoulder pain and numbness etc. I was released from the emergency room 12 hours later. I continued to have severe symptoms. The shortness of breath was so bad that I didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights straight because my oxygen would drop. I also had severe insomnia and no appetite and lost 5 pounds in 1 week. Major adrenaline feeling. I went back to the emergency room 2 more times this week to check out my heart and lungs. All of my doctors recommended ER since they couldn&#39;t help me. My neurologist said he is getting lots of these symptoms from people post vaccine.  My shortness of breath and elevated heart rate and numbness and tingling are still here and I can barely go up and down stairs without being out of breath and having a 130-140 heart rate and super low blood pressure and night sweats. It is awful.

                                                The day after the injection I had a itchy red knot appear at the injection site. Starting 27 hours after injection I had chills, anxiety, slight shortness of breath, headaches, body aches. Today I have had nausea that comes and goes, the red knot is still present on my right arm and the redness has increased a small amount from the marking placed last night. The injection is not in my deltoid muscle or even close and I am wondering if that is at the least what created the redness and the knot.

                                                Short of breath; Chest pain; Heart above 120s; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular on 18Dec2020 at 20:00 at a single dose at the left arm in the hospital for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. Patient was not pregnant at time of report. The patient previously took excedrin [acetylsalicylic acid;caffeine;paracetamol;salicylamide] and experienced allergies. Concomitant medication included Tejocote root. The patient experienced heart above 120s, short of breath, fatigue, and chest pain, all on 21Dec2020 at 13:00. Patient went to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit for the events. The patient received treatment which included Tylenol as needed for the events. Tested for Covid twice since the vaccination; Covid test post vaccination - Nasal Swab on 30Dec2020 and on unknown date, both with negative results. Cardiologist consult was pending. Outcome of the events was reported as not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 45-year-old female patient had medical history included hypertension, and was on concomitant medication.  The reported events short of breath and chest pain were more likely due to underlying disease, and less likely causally related to first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The next morning my right ear swelled , was red and covered in hives and very painful.  It continued to swell over next few days, very painful. I was feeling drained and had gastrointestinal symptoms for days and this morning woke up with my face swollen and another rash and hives on my face. I had a little trouble breathing as well and went to an Urgent Care. The doctor believes I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and administered a steroid injection and prescribed steroids and antihistamines.

I have a sore throat it feels tight, I?m dizzy and just feel sick all around and still have no appetite but I?m thirsty and my finger tingle.

A 45-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on the right deltoid, on 04Jan2021 at a single dose as she wanted added protection (Covid-19 immunization). The patient medical history was not reported. The patient has no heart issues but has a family history of heart disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient was asking if it is okay to take second dose after experiencing side effects of fever, body ache, joint pain, probably anxiety, chest heaviness 8-10h after (not wheezing, 98% O2 saturation) which returned next day and subsided. On 04Jan2021, the patient got her first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine, she was one of the lucky people who had joint pain, body aches, and a fever for about 3 days. She noticed about 8-10 hours after she got the vaccine that she started feeling heaviness in her chest, chest felt tight and heavy; not shortness of breath, harder to take a deep breath. She had no wheezing. In Jan2021, her oxygen level was 98%. She was chocking it up to anxiety in Jan2021. It went away. She had it the same day and the next day intermittently. It was short and passing. She is still having joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs. It is intermittent and mainly at night. She is supposed to get the second dose next Friday and asking should she go ahead and get the second dose. The joint pain had went away intermittently on Tuesday, then hit her harder on Wednesday. Thursday she felt okay but the Friday again was having the pain. It is still occurring. It is mainly at night. In the day she feels okay. It is when she lays down to relax that it kicks in. It is mainly irritating but she would say it is medically significant as it has lasted for a while, almost 2 weeks now and she is still having issues.  She takes 1000mg of acetaminophen (TYLENOL) to knock it out. The heaviness in her chest lasted about 1.5 hours the first day, and then went into Tuesday intermittently.

                                                COVID-19 pneumonia; COVID-19 pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) from a Pfizer-sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs). A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EK570), via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she felt yucky afterwards on 23Dec2020, experienced shortness of breath on exertion and coughing on 26Dec2020; chills, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, body aches, fever on 28Dec2020; loss of taste, loss of smell and COVID-19 pneumonia on 07Jan2021.  All the events were reported as being medically significant.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 29Dec2020.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia and included: started on bronchodilator, cough elixir, steroids and azithromycin (ZITHROMAX).  The outcome of muscle pain, body aches and COVID-19 pneumonia was recovering and of loss of taste and loss of smell was not recovered.  The causality of the suspect vaccine to the events was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

                                                DAY 1 (Thurs. 1/14/21 - received 2nd dose of the vaccine at 8:49 am central time): 15 MINS POST SHOT: acute tingling around mouth and tongue; BP spiked and face became very flushed. Waited with nurse until 1 hour post shot. BP stayed above normal all day, as did fatigue. 12 HOURS POST SHOT: sever headaches warranting migraine medicine but I only took Tylenol and Ibuprofen since Maxalt (10 mg) can raise BP. Alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen every 3 hours but would only get about 2 hours of relief each time. This continued through the night.   DAY 2 (Fri. 1/15/21): 23 HOURS POST SHOT: Headache remained. but was lessened after taking Mucinex D. Extremely fatigued, which remained throughout the day.  24 HOURS POST SHOT (9:00 am): Saw NP at clinic, BP was normal.  Was prescribed Fioricet, ESGIC 50-325-40 and advised to take it if headache returned. If ineffective after 2 hours, advised to take Maxalt 10 mg. 10:10 am: took Fioricet with no impact to headache, took Maxalt at 12:10. 28  HOURS POST SHOT: Severe, painful heartburn in my chest and  upper back - Mylanta provided no relief.  Headache returned and started having severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath. 29 HOURS POST SHOT (~2PM) Went to urgent care; vitals were all normal. Received fluids and &#34;GI cocktail&#34; containing lidocaine. Heartburn pain subsided but headaches and abdominal pain. Was advised to go to Emergency Department and did. ED ran multiple labs and ECG to rule out gallbladder, pancreas, etc. Headaches and abdominal pain at this point were excruciating and debilitating. Shortness of breath was significant. ED staff said they have seen the different reactions I was having to the vaccine, just not all together in one patient at the same time. Pain subsided after fluids with Benadryl, Toradol and Reglan. Was discharged approximately 4 hours after arrival. MD prescribed Reglan for continued headaches through the weekend.  DAY 3 (Sat. 1/16/21): 48  HOURS POST SHOT: Severe headache when I awoke. Reglan did not provide relief. After two hours, took Maxalt 10 mg . Headaches and significant fatigue continued with such severity I took Maxalt as frequently as allowed per dosing instructions. I stayed in a dark room until Monday (1/18/21, Day 5), ensuring I was staying well hydrated and nourished. The fatigue was so significant that movement was very labored. It should be noted that I am a very active person and I had zero energy and missed two days of work (Fri and Mon).  DAY 4: headaches were less frequent  DAY5 (Mon. 1/18/21): At 3:30 PM (~126 hours post shot) - it was like someone flipped a light switch and the fatigue and headaches were gone and I felt like I was back to normal.   DAYS 6-7, (Tues. and Wed 1/19-20/21) - worked a normal day at work.  DAY 8 (Thu. 1/21/21): extremely fatigued again, like over the weekend, but it only lasted today.  Of note, the lips and tongue tingling would come and go following the initial weekend of severe reactions. While noticeable, it was not as significant as within the first 15 mins of receiving the dose.  On Monday 1/25/21 at approximately 3:00 PM, the tingling was very noticeable and my BP spiked again. Since that time until now, I have had no reactions.

After approximately 10-15 minutes I noticed a reaction. I was really lightheaded , short of breath, and shaking. It felt like I was going to pass out. I was given water and a bar to eat, and eventually I got to a place where I felt that I could drive. I went for a walk with a couple of friends, but was having a hard time walking because of shortness of breath, and was still lightheaded plus I had skin tingling on both sides of my face. I ate something afterward the walk and felt better within an hour. The next day I seemed to be fine, but then Friday (two days after the shot) I became increasingly lightheaded/dizzy and nauseous. Additionally, I had issues on Friday and Saturday with anxiety and trying to hold off mild panic attacks plus depression and nausea. I was still lightheaded/dizzy and had shortness of breath for a week after the shot. which has extend to today (February 5, 2021), over a week after the shot.

After a couple hours my nose felt numb and tingly inside and stayed like that until the day after.  The day after i had the vaccine if I try to eat it flairs the burning fizzing feeling in my mouth and lips again.   Feel week and tired, headaches and body pain. Im concerned with the mouth stuff though before getting the second dose.

She does report a sensation of feeling like difficulty breathing or swallowing and is initially treated with Solu-Medrol and Benadryl as well as IV fluids.  She reports that symptoms are improving almost immediately after meds are pushed.  As result epinephrine is initially deferred for continued monitoring.  However upon reassessment approximately 1 hour after reported reaction, the numbness in the hands and feet have resolved, but she is complaining that she feels as though the back of her tongue is swollen and still making it difficult to swallow though she no longer feels short of breath.  As a result, we have discussed the possibility of treatment with epinephrine in order to fully resolve symptoms, and she is agreeable to proceed. ,

Puffy, itchy eyes (both eyes) with rash came and lasted about two weeks. Monday or Tuesday, I noticed a rash all over my body - red and blotchy. That went away in a day. I got chills, fever, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and that lasted 48 hours (16th in pm-17th and got better evening of 18th). When I had the rash was all over the body, I took a Zyrtec. The weekend I was really sick I didn&#39;t take any medication.  Phone visit with Doctor  - January 15th - allergist - I followed up with him about the throat constriction. He just was monitoring symptoms. After the weekend that I was really sick,  I told him and he ordered bloodwork.

                                                chest pain; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient herself). A 45-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 (at the age of 45-years-old) in left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Patient had no chronic illnesses and no allergies. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination and was not tested COVID post vaccination. Other medications in two weeks was none. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer) on 21Dec2021 12:00 PM via intramuscular in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced chest pain and shortness of breath on 15Feb2021 01:00 (as reported). Clinical course: She took her second vaccine on 10Jan2021. Two weeks after the vaccine she was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath x2, one on 19Feb2021 (as reported) and the second time was 24Feb2021. On an unspecified date, all the blood works and CT (computerised tomogram) scan came back negative. She was a healthy individual until she took this vaccine. She also did Echocardiogram which came back negative. Events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). No treatment was received for events. Outcome of events were unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, chest pain and shortness of breath occurred 2 weeks following the second vaccine are more likely associated with coincidental medical conditions unlikely related to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

In the evening around 11 pm, I experienced difficulty in breathing and had a slow heart rate.  In addition to muscle pain on my left arm where I got the shot, whenever I almost felt into sleep I was startled and woke up from short of breath.  I wore a watch to check on my heart rate.  On the low end it went into 53 ~ 54 especially when I felt short of breath.  On the high end it was around 67 ~ 70 which is my normal heat beat when at rest.

                                                I had leg weakness, feeling like both legs going to give out about 15 minutes after vaccine, later feeling of fatigue and unwellness.  Couple of days later had dysphagia, food getting stuck in throat, throat tightness,  feeling of phlegm, severe leg  spasms  in both legs,  I could see spasms/jerking  through pants,  then had arm and hand tremors/spasms and leg weakness/feeling of legs going to give out.  I had to go to ER and then had relapse of same symptoms week later.   I still have dysphagia, unable to swallow solids,  food and pills stuck in throat, throat tightness, weight loss of 12lbs, leg weakness and pain, excessive fatigue.

                                                Within minutes of the COVID injection my heart was racing and fluttering with flushing and warmth in my face. Resting heart rate was as high as 140 (measured by my Apple watch) prior to seeking medical assistance. After sitting in the waiting area for 20 minutes my pulse had slowed down to 100 (my resting heart rate is typically lower-mid 60s); however, my pulse was still high and I did not feel well and had started clearing my throat with mild tightness in my throat and chest. A doctor took my blood pressure reading was 140/78, typically my blood pressure is 105/65.  My throat was not visibly swollen. At about 40min the EMT hooked me up to monitor my blood pressure, oxygen, pulse. At the same time I was being hooked to the monitor, my lower lip began itching and visibly showing minor swelling as well as minor swelling and red splotches in my cheeks and forehead. My heart was initially showing PVC but returned to normal. After being monitored for about 30 minutes my adverse reactions had slowed and stabilized to be released to go home. I took antihistamines and ibuprofen.

Also had fatigue, possible due to not sleeping well due to sx. Around 10:00 am began having difficulty concentrating, headaches, muscle aches and chills intensified. Around 11am confirmed fever of 100 d F, took Tylenol which lessened chills. General malaise continued through evening, 8pm, took another Tylenol, by 9 pm began having series of intense and persistent (nonstop) heart related symptoms (chest pounding, tachycardia, shortness of breath,) which continued for several hours. (exact time unknown, I am guessing it lessened around 2am or so.) Following am, all symptoms gone. (might have continued to have some intermittent heart stuff as that has been ongoing every day, but non-stop intense cardiac feelings were not continuing by morning.

                                                I started with a cough and that got progressively worse until I started throwing up. After throwing up I felt like I could not get enough air for about 40 mins. I had a Abuteral inhaler left from fighting bronchitis so I took a few puffs of that and started to feel a little better. Through the night I continued to throw up a few times and having a lot of coughing.  The next day mt throat was on fire and could not really talk. I am assuming this was from all the coughing and throwing up.

                                                I had my second vaccine on Monday, 3/22, and woke up at 1am on Thursday 3/25 with extreme chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating and chills.  I went to the ER, and they discovered two blood clots in my lungs.  I&#39;ve never had pulmonary embolisms before, so this is a very strange coincidence.  I am in cancer treatment, so my risk of PEs is higher, but the timing is too close for me not to think that the second vaccine traumatized my immune system, causing the PEs.

This is a typical mast cell reaction for me. I took 20 mg of Fomatadine a few minutes later. I had already had 50mg Bendryl on board. About 20 minutes after the Fomatadine the swelling in the throat started to improve slightly. I left the facility where I had the shot after about an hour and my condition did not worsen. I fulle recovered in about 48 hours.

                                                15 minutes and 21 seconds after shot was given, I felt suddenly very hot, lightheaded and I could feel my pulse escalating. Nurse in the post-shot monitoring tent took vitals to confirm pulse at 95, when typically 68. I was laid down and BP dropped to 110/78. Chest tightness that I am familiar with from asthma started to develop and my neck and throat and upper shoulders felt very tight and constricted. I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.  I had informed the injection staff prior to receiving my vaccine that I am a person with a history of anaphylaxis (not to a vaccine) that required and epi pen and overnight hospital stay in the past .

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 in deltoid left at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  Family medical history relevant to event was none. Relevant tests were none. Patient reported she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021 and had pain at the injection site. On 07Jan21 she started having muscle aches and got something that look like hives on the arm and her skin felt really hot to touch, it was fire engine red on the right upper arm. On 08Jan2021, she woke up and felt like she got hit by a tractor trailer, has severe aches, voice very raspy, and very wiped out with headaches.  Patient mentioned injection site arm was bright red and warm to touch after injection, but has improved. When waking up this morning on 08Jan2021 even walking this morning from the bedroom to the bathroom she was fatigued and it has gotten better with her walking around, but she still felt wiped out. The muscle aches was very short lived. She went to do something at work and it took a minute for her to catch her breath and that and the muscle aches went away and that was it. An hour later she felt very flushed and itchy and coworkers joked with her about what she ate for lunch, which was nothing different. On the opposite arm from injection arm she had hives on the lower right arm. They were there about 15-20 minutes and it turned completely fire engine red and that lasted about half an hour. She showed the doctor she worked with and they recommended diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), which she didn&#39;t take, it was weird. All this subsided and she felt fine afterwards. Last night she felt very fatigued when walking around the house. This morning when she woke up she felt very, very, very fatigued. Walking took a lot of effort out of her. It is hard to explain, but people say this was how they felt when they had Covid. She felt very lethargic and very tired. Patient still had a lingering headache, but nothing like she felt earlier this morning. It&#39;s not terrible, but it wasn&#39;t pleasant for a couple of hours. Patient was unable to provide seriousness for today&#39;s events (08Jan2021), and stated it wasn&#39;t really life threatening, but more significant than yesterday. Patient denied having any other vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No history of problems or adverse events with vaccines in past. Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with events were reported as related.  Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of severe aches, voice very raspy, headache/lingering headache, wiped out /fatigued/tired were not recovered; outcome of lethargic, it took a minute for her to catch her breath, flushed and itchy was unknown, and outcome of other events were recovering.

EMTs again called and again sats ok, BP ok and HR in 90s.  Wheezing better with 4 inhalations of Albuterol HFA. They wouldn&#39;t give me any meds without sending me to ER, so I left and went home and  took 50 mg Benadryl and another 2 sprays of albuterol at 4 hours post vaccine and did well.

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot: EL3247, Expiry Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included food allergic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced allergic reaction on 15Jan2021. The patient alerted she wasn&#39;t feeling well a few minutes after receiving vaccine. The patient was experiencing being flushed, had a fast heart rate, and her heart rate kept increasing over time, despite two benadryl, the patient had allergic reactions in the past due to food, so the patient knew what it felt like, so could expect it, so the patient spoke up soon, and the Epipen was given 28-30 minutes later, and after that, the patient said her throat felt thick and she had trouble swallowing, so was taken to the hospital. The patient seemed to be getting worse, after time, after the Epipen. The patient was most likely admitted to the hospital. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                On 1/17/2021 @ approximately 1130, I ran upstairs and began experiencing extreme shortness of breath, dizziness and increased heart rate with what felt like palpitations, as well as a massive headache. The symptoms resolved subsided after 10 minutes, but returned again shortly afterwards. After taking some Advil 200mg x 1, my symptoms improved but I still remained fatigued and had difficulty breathing at 100% the rest of the day. After the 2nd episode 911 was contacted and FD arrived at my home. All vital signs, pulse &amp; O2 were WNL, except BP @ 153/99. I&#39;ve had one previous experience with this and it was while taking Izoniazid as a TB prophylactic after a 6 month treatment. As of today, my symptoms have resolved and am back to  my usual state.

They were frequent, had associated symptoms of chest discomfort and breathlessness, and I went to the doctor. Their frequency/severity trended toward improving, but after the 2nd vaccine I was back to their original intensity/frequency. I do not have a history of similar. They are affecting my daily life. I&#39;ve been referred to a Cardiologist.

I received my second dose on 1/7/2020, I was still having COVID symptoms. Symptoms worsened after the second dose. My heart rate has been out of control. I have been on steroids daily, because I was so short of breath.  I have not been at work since being diagnosed with COVID.  I went ahead and got the second dose, because my job told me that I had to get the second dose.  I still have fatigue,  elevated heart rate, blood pressure is till elevated. I have been started on blood pressure medication.  I have also been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea.  I had a sleep study performed. I am on  two new inhalers. One is a steroid inhaler for lungs and one is a rescue inhaler for when I am short of breath. It has not pleasant. Headaches are horrible and daily.  I went to ER, because headache was so severe. No medication I take for headaches work.  I have not been able to work since I was diagnosed with COVID.

                                                Within a few minutes of vaccine, I got a severe piercing headache and nausea / vomiting which we attributed to nerves and I went to go home without reporting. During the drive the headache and nausea got worse and my extremities and face began to tingle. My chest felt tight. My body was shaking. My colleague noted weak pulses and pale complexion. I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

                                                Throat swelling; severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine; chills; sweats; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from two contactable physicians. A 46-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 at a single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included herpes Simplex I, back pain, SI joint dysfunction, difficulty sleeping and allergy to raw tomatoes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced throat swelling, severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine, chills, sweats, nausea, the seriousness of throat swelling, severe allergic reaction was reported as hospitalization, seriousness of the other events was reported as medically significant.  Under anaphylaxis that the patient has EpiPen at home for raw tomatoes Clinical course: she had a severe reaction to the first shot presenting the following side effects: chills, sweats  and nausea within 5 minutes and then developed throat swelling within 10 minutes, the patient was administered with an EpiPen, Benadryl and was sent to the ER where she received Benadryl IV monitored, eventually her symptoms diminished from 10 of 10 to a 6 in a scale of 10, the patient also received Prednisone 40 mg everyday for 4 days. She did have nausea and sweats. It was six out of ten in the ER. Then it went to four or five out of ten. It took four to five days to get back to normal. By five days after the vaccination she was back to normal. She had a virtual visit with a patient who apparently had a severe reaction after the first vaccine. It was set up in physical therapy office.  HCP wants to know if it is safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine. HCP mentioned that this is her first patient who has a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. She was feeling better. She was told to call her doctor about getting the second shot. The bottom line is if they acted as severely as they did she would think the answer would be not to get the second. She was better. She felt fine. She has an allergy to raw tomatoes. She knows she is not supposed to have raw tomatoes. A couple of days ago she had a dressing that must have had raw tomatoes in it because she had throat swelling. The patient said what happened with Pfizer was more. She knew it when it was happening because it has happened before. She had no hypoxia. The patient reported that her pulse ox was checked and was in the high 90&#39;s. The patient was able to swallow. No drooling. She did have nausea and sweats. It was six out of ten in the ER. Then it went to four or five out of ten. It took four to five days to get back to normal. By five days after the vaccination she was back to normal. On 23Nov2020, the patient weighed 150 pounds and her height was 66 inches. The outcome of events was recovering.  There is a causality, because it happened with 5 to 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. She had to wait for 15 minutes. The patient had chills, sweats, and nausea within 5 minutes. She felt fine upon immediately receiving and then within 5 minutes she had chills, sweat, nausea, headache. Then within 5 to 10 minutes throat swelling.

Then within 5 to 10 minutes throat swelling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile and temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

There were no other secondary systemic/organs affected apart from mild transient hypertension. Given the strong concern for subjective airway compromise, I directed the administration of epi which the patient said she felt her throat relax after adminstration. 911 was called and patient was transported to ED.

Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 26 Mar2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat, my blood pressure was high, my throat was closing, she experienced body aches and at home she started wheezing/bilateral wheeze. Within minutes of receiving the vaccine, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat and she had a weird sensation in her throat, 15 minutes later she was not able to form words. The patient was given liquid Benadryl (oral) for my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat and her symptoms resolved. She went to the nurse station, who took her BP which was high, which it normally is not so the treating physician felt confident in letting me go home. She was monitored for an hour and was sent home with no more tongue swelling. At home she started wheezing. She called her HCP and was advised to take a nebulizer with no effect. At around 14:00, when the Benadryl wore off, her throat was closing so she was directed to epi-pen herself and call 911. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital and treated for anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. She was given prednisone 50mg by mouth daily for four days and a refill for her Epipen. No additional Epipen was administered. On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced skin hurting like a neuropathy, chills and she experienced a rash. On an unknown date in Mar2021, she experienced bronchospasm, upper airway swelling, respiratory distress, dry cough, hoarse voice and difficulty breathing (without wheeze or stridor).

My whole face and ears turned red and i was itchy on my arms. 2 doses of Benadryl made the allergic reaction ease. I was tired for the next two weeks, and then started having heart palpitations regularly. Went to ER was diagnosed with Tachycardia, Hyperkalemia, Hypomagnesemia, and Hypocalcemiaand. Corrected with intravenous drugs and overnight stay in the hospital. Slowing feeling some better, but struggling with inflammation and being exhausted. Felt 100% great before getting this vaccine. Advised by doctors not to get second shot and did not get it.

Since then I have taken Benadryl. On 12/30 at 10am I was exp reaction again went back to the ER. They provided me with breathing treatment and was sent home on Prednisone. I contacted my PCP to inform her that I have to continue taking Benadryl to help with sob and my voice changes. It seems like my lungs are affected due to taking the vaccine. I&#39;m currently off and not able to receive comp due to the vaccine being voluntary.

Then I began to have difficulty swallowing my saliva. And then the lump inside my throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time Dr  had already injected me with Epipen and the pharmacist injected me with Solumedrol and I still felt as if I was having difficulty breathing and then I was taken to  ER and I really can&#39;t remember too much after that. I was very groggy and then I was discharged from  ED about 9:30 pm.

A 47-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 30Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high cholesterol (it was under control. Diagnosed a couple years ago). There were no concomitant medications. She did her first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 30Dec2020, and she had a little experience, she didn&#39;t tell the nurse at that time, but she went through her paperwork and decided to call Pfizer. When she got the shot, she was told to go to the next room to sit down for 15 minutes. When she went to the next room, 1 minute later, her heart started beating very fast, then she started to feel like she could not breathe/difficulty breathing for that moment. So, she tried to calm herself down and she focused on her phone to play games and to not think about it. After a couple minutes, it had gone. it was probably gone maybe about 10 minutes later. After 15 minutes, she went back to her office, everything was ok. Her heart was beating but not that fast, it was calmer than before, and she had a light headache, then some soreness on the vaccine site, on the left side, &#39;she thinks that is normal, right?&#39; Clarifies soreness as swelling and painful on the area where she was vaccinated. She wanted to know, was she able to go back for the second shot, she was scheduled for 20Jan2021. Regarding light headache, she took some paracetamol (Extra Strength Tylenol, strength: 500mg, expiration date: Jun2024, lot number: SJC214). Soreness outcome: It went away, maybe the third day (02Jan2021), it was completely gone. The third day it was ok to completely sleep and lean on that side. She has recovered completely. The third day (02Jan2021), she noticed an itch around that area (site of vaccine), but she was not scratching it. The itching had gone, she had recovered completely. The outcome of heart started beating very fast and could not breathe was recovered on 30Dec2020, light headache was not recovered, soreness at vaccine site was recovered on 02Jan2021, itching at vaccine site was recovered on an unspecified date of Jan2021, and swelling on the area where she was vaccinated was unknown.

Dryness in mouth still there and water couldn?t quench my thirst. Escorted to Emergency department. Epinephrine shot given 40mg of prednisone, 20 mg of Pepcid and 10 mg of Zyrtec given. Given another 20mg of prednisone, 10 mg of Pepcid and 10 mg of Zyrtec 1.5 hours later. Release after 4.5 hours. Given 3 days of medicine previously given. Swelling started back up 6 hours later so I took 50 mg of Benadryl. Swelling continued every 6-8 hours. Mouth was still really dry but as long as I drank 100 oz of water a day I was ok.   Tuesday I had a small fever and very achy. Went to doctor and he prescribed 20 mg of prednisone twice daily tapering off for 11 days, 10 mg of Pepcid and Zyrtec twice daily for 11 more days.  Finished my medicine Saturday January 2nd. I have been feeling better but still have swelling occasionally.

A 47-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:49 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   There were no known medical history or concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced nausea, headache, and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.

                                                I was vaccinated at 3:30pm .  At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

                                                Received shot at approximately 2pm and was in observation chairs.  Around 205pm I took a dose of tylenol to attempt to prevent fever.  I immediately noticed that the medication felt stuck in my esophagus and it was hard to swallow them down.  Being a nurse I began to monitor more closely my breathing.  I was able to take air into my lungs easily.  Next I noticed that my nose became very stuffy and was difficulty to breath through but my airway continued to seem ok and I was breathing without difficulty through my nose.  By about 210pm I had noticed that my face felt strange. As another few minutes progress my entire face felt numb like when your dental lidocaine is wearing off.  It was a very disturbing feeling.  I never had difficulty breathing but the throat and nasal swelling lasted about 1 1/2 hours.  The facial numbness lasted at least 4 hours and my nose and tongue still feel a little strange even at this moment.  I stayed in the observation area for about 35 minutes just to make sure I was not going to lose my airway before leaving.  I am a nurse and I didn&#39;t want to get sent to the ER for hours just to be given benadryl since my airway was ok so I didn&#39;t report it at the time of incident.  I had preloaded with zyrtec, pepcid and ibuprofen the morning prior to injection to try and avoid reaction or side effects that others were reporting.  I think if I had not had antihistamine in my system I would have had anaphylaxis for sure.  I went straight home and took more antihistamine.  Contacted my doctor so she knew of the symptoms.  She told me to continue the antihistamines for a few days and to go to the ER if severe issue happened.  This was a VERY VERY scary incident.   For a little history: after my first vaccine I noticed itching on my chest but couldn&#39;t see any rash.  About day 3-4 a rash appeared.  I was unsure if this was vaccine related since it took 3 days to appear.  It was cleared after a few days of steroid cream.

                                                throat closing; tingling immediately in left arm; rapid heartbeat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient. A 47-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL 1283), intramuscular in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at 17:00 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.

                                                Immediately upon having the injection administered, my heart rate sped up. I sat down within the waiting area for monitoring thinking that if I sat down for a bit, that it would  maybe pass . Within about 7 minutes of  that, I began to feel the back, left side of my throat go numb. I began to get very dizzy after that and I alerted one the pharmacy Nurses, that was on duty. She asked for me to open  My mouth so that she could see if my throat was swelling &amp; said that she didn?t see anything and I was told by her that it may just be anxiety that I was experiencing and she asked me to take a few sips of water and to try and relax a bit. She resumed helping others, while I continued to sit there. It was then when I experienced a heavy onset of chest tightness and the inability to breathe. The left side of my face and jaw went numb &amp; that?s when I really knew something was wrong. I was taken outside for some fresh air and realize that I was so nauseous, more dizzy, very weak upon standing and I told the same nurse and another young lady that was assisting me that I felt like I was going to pass out and to please call EMS for me . At that time, I lost temporary feeling in all 4 limbs  and I began to experience heart  palpitations . I was having some trouble swallowing and I was laid down and. My blood pressure was taken. Blood Pressure was 235/130 and it was taken several times until emts arrived. It was then 200/120 and 180/112 by the time help arrived. Overall I experienced burning sensation in chest and abdomen, facial weakness and numbness left side fever loose stools weakness, shortness of brEath and chest tightness blurred vision felt like I?m out of touch with reality Malaise restless and the loss in feeling in my Limbs are slowly returning body And  muscle and joint aches and pains and wheezing bouts

A 47-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 (at the age of 47 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: shellfish, seasonal allergies and psoriasis. Concomitant medications included several medications in two weeks. The patient is not pregnant. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 29Jan2021 23:45, after being asleep for approximately one hour, felt acutely short of breath and anxious, which lasted less than a minute and was then followed by numbness and tingling in her neck - radiating to the pinnae of her ears, bilateral shoulders and to bilateral upper and lower extremities (BUE and BLE). These events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included PCR/nasal swab on 29Jan2021 (post vaccination) which showed negative. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events which included diphenhydramine (BENADRYL), IVF. Outcome of all the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Over night on the night following the vaccination, I had headache, body aches, malaise and insomnia.  Throughout the next day (1/13/21), I continued to have headache, body aches, and malaise as well as objective fever (up to about 101.5 degrees F), fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and lightheadedness.  Later in the day (about 5:00pm) I developed significant shortness of breath at rest and chest pain.  Later that evening I went to the Emergency Department because of concern over my extreme and persistent shortness of breath and chest pain.  In the E.D. they did the following tests:  EKG (normal), oximetry (normal), Portable Chest Xray (normal), rapid COVID test (normal), cardiac enzymes (normal), D-DIMER (ELEVATED), other bloodwork (normal).  Because of the elevated D-dimer, a CT angiogram of the chest was performed to rule-out pulmonary embolism.  The CT showed enlarged lymph nodes, but no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  I was discharged home.  By the next morning (1/14/21) I was feeling much better.  And by the afternoon of 1/14/21 I was feeling completely back to normal without any symptoms.

Tingling in lips, tongue, face, scalp, left leg and left arm Shaking hands and racing heart, intermittently  48 hours later Entire left hemisphere of body want numb for about three hours. I freaked out and cried.  *I had the vaccine in my left bicep, and I have a pinched nerve in that shoulder, which is teemed to activate. The nerve has never caused numbness beyond my left arm before, however, Last round of trembling about 48 hours after injection  72 hours later: Left tonsil and throat and armpit lymph nodes still swollen, but markedly less. Moderate numbness in left cheek and left side of throat, but less.

                                                About 40 minutes after inject, had stomach upset, went to gas station across the street, then starting having a tickle in my throat, then coughing, then wheezing, intense headache and sore throat pain like it felt like I swallowed pieces of glass then more wheezing and hard to breathe and losing my voice. Arrived at ER about 1 hour or so after injection time  about 12:35 maybe?, they started IV of steroid, benedryl and pepcid rather quickly I don&#39;t remember a lot , was very out of it.  But the medicine worked and swelling went down on tongue and throat and my voice came back. They prescribed steroids, benedryl, pepcid and zofran because I was and still very nauseous. Taking advil for headache. I think i was home by 4 or 4:30.    Still feeling awful today.

                                                Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine at hospital on 3/15/21. Given her history of anaphylaxis with demerol she was asked to stay for 40 minutes. She is unsure how soon her reaction started but thinks within 20 minutes of getting a shot. Her symptoms started with a sore throat, followed by throat tightness, chest tightness. These symptoms improved a bit with drinking water but didn&#39;t go away. She didn&#39;t experience tongue swelling or lip tingling like she does with eating certain foods (see below). She took her own benadryl and was better in 15-20 minutes and denies recurrence of symptoms.   Denies dizziness/fatigue, urticaria, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, wheezing, n/v/d post immunization.

I took 10 mg of  liquid cetirizine hcl oral solution which I carry with me.  I waited an additional 25 minutes at the facility and the itching and swelling and heart rate diminished.  I took 800 mg ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol to treat the severe headache.  About 30 minutes after that, my headache was much better.  I went home and slept for 3 hours and felt almost normal thereafter.

Then My right ankle swelled up.  My face and hands had hives on them.  My throat felt better, I thought but about 1/2 hr. Later I started wheezing and my right ankle and leg were swollen  so, I went to the urgacare.  They saw me but told me that I should&#39;ve gone to the ER. I have a history of anaphylaxis. They gave me steriods and Benadryl via shots and sent me home with the same.  I woke the next morning with a sore arm, a horrible headache and my face broke out into hives and was swollen again. Today is the 4th day after and my face still feels a little swollen, I have a headache and now an earache in my left ear.  Today I also felt nauseous and couldn&#39;t eat.

A 48-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at 48-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2000 and ongoing (diagnosed 20 year ago).  There were no concomitant medications. On 21Dec2020, the patient experienced: chest got tight (non-serious), shortness of breath (non-serious), throat was itchy, and felt like it closed.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The caller was a respiratory therapist (also reported as health care professional (HCP)). The patient&#39;s first dose of the vaccine was on 21Dec2020 at the hospital where she works. Five hours after getting the vaccine, her chest got tight, she has shortness of breath, her throat was itchy, and she felt like it closed. The patient had asthma (diagnosed 20 years ago) and felt this reaction. It took 48 hours after the initial symptoms that she felt better.  For treatment, the patient took her salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient was scared to have the second dose; and she was going to talk to her primary care physician (PCP) about the second dose (but she did not think she would have much knowledge on what to do). The patient had a COVID PCR test the day she received the vaccine, and it was negative. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 PCR test: negative on 21Dec2020.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

Symptoms are swollen cheeks and welts , sudden itchiness at the site of my mask placement. The reason for this report is a sudden onset of excruciating and debilitating pain throughout my body specifically pain of my right shoulder radiating down my sprightly arm. I have been receiving testing and treatment for ongoing neuropathy due to Longhauler syndrome, however This recent pain is so debilitating, I spend most of my time in bed.  I have been experiencing chills then profuse sweating.  I also so fatigued, I sleep much of the day.  I have been having episodes of tachycardia with chest tightness which has increased since after having the vaccine. I also become short winded on exertion. I?ve been waking up in a panic and sweating.

                                                I waited 15 minutes and was fine. As I was driving to my work, my injection site began to hurt severely and I felt my throat swelling, it became increasingly difficult to swallow. My tongue felt larger and my lips and face began to feel numb. I felt flushed and I became tachycardic. It lasted about 45 seconds and then waned and then would flare again.  I was able to speak and called my husband (a physician) who stayed on the phone with me while I drove to the hospital. I went straight to an outpatient unit and was given hydrocortisone IV, loratidine PO and famotidine. By the time I was on the unit, my throat only felt slightly tight with tachycardia down to 103. Following the injection of steroids, I only had one further flare of throat tightness and tachycardia that was transient lasting 30-40 seconds. Everything resolved within 40 minutes of receiving therapy. Of note, I apparently had erythema on the anterior of my neck which corresponded to the area of throat tightness.

                                                Severe muscle pain across upper back (felt like muscle was being pulled off bone, unable to sit up for longer than 10-15 minutes at a time without leaning on desk or needing to lay down), general muscle pain (not as severe) throughout the rest of my body.  Headache, fatigue (exhausted), brain fog, muscle tightness (unable to take a deep breath due to tightness...not short of breath). Swollen lymph nodes in right armpit, overall feeling exhausted.   Treatment: I just slept a lot, took Tylenol.  I have a doctors appointment today.  Outcome: Slowly getting better. Still have brain fog , fatigue (not exhausted anymore), muscle weakness (not the severe pain anymore).

                                                After ten minutes my throat began to feel swollen, a feeling of a lump in my throat.  After around 20 minutes I also began to feel more light headed/dizzy.  I was moved to be observed by a nurse for another 20 minutes and when symptoms did not subside I was moved to the Emergency Department where they administered Epinephrine at 9:27am, Pepcid, 9:24am, Solu-medrol 9:24-10:50am.  Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis. Dr. wanted to prescribe Benadryl IV but I declined as I needed to drive home and the facility was far from home. I was discharged around 1:00pm.   A prescription for an Epi Pen was made by Dr.  and filled that day at pharmacy.  and spoke to my Dr. at another healthcare organization at 4:30pm.  Benadryl OTC was then rx&#39;d by my primary care doctor at 4:30pm-50mg every 6 hrs moving to 25 mg every 6 hours the next day.   Symptoms of swollen throat continued into the next day and have not yet abated but also have not worsened. Due to continued throat swelling I have taken 50mg of Benadryl the next day as well. Dr. my primary care Dr. scheduled an allergist appt for Feb. 3, 2021 and advised I should not get the second dose of the COVID19 vaccine until I speak with an allergist and have a treatment plan developed.

It was a similar feeling to getting contrast through an IV. I took two Benadryl and Ibuprofen to help relieve the symptoms. The metal taste lasted until the next day.  Friday- The next morning I woke if with a fever 100° . Minus the mild arm pain, I initially felt ok but as the day went on I felt worse, like the flu. By 11am my heart was racing even at rest. My pulse is usually in the low 60 range (athlete) and it was 95-115 from 11am until late that evening.  Saturday- symptoms gone but huge dark circles under my eyes. I felt great though.

                                                Within 5 mins of vaccine I felt my chest tightening.  I could still breathe but I could tell my lungs were tight.  Taking a deep breath was not normal.    Soon after I felt the muscles between my shoulder blades starting to tighten as well.  I think a response to my tightness in my chest.    We were instructed to stay in facility for 15 mins.  My symptoms did not increase after 15 mins so I went home. That was 5:00pm.  By bedtime at 10:00pm  my symptoms had resolved.    I?m not sure if I should get my second dose?

I am post COVID and was Dx on 07/14/2020. I was discharged from the hospital on 09/17/2021.  From my stay in the hospital on 07/14/2020  up until 02/15/2021 I had the minimum hair loss that  one would loss in a day. I am not sure if the vaccines caused it , but my hair literally came out in clumps.  I also started experiencing heart palpitations  along with SOB in the evenings after the first vaccine.  Upon  the second week in February, I started experiencing the palpitations and SOB in the evenings. Again, I am not sure if the vaccines caused this as I am post COVID.

This 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), the first dose (Lot # EL1283) intramuscular at single dose in the right arm on 15Jan2021 and the second dose at single dose in the left arm on 03Feb2021 11:30, for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included exposure to sars-cov-2 in Dec2020 (Her mother ended up positive for Covid and she was exposed to her and showed symptoms). There were no concomitant medications.   On 03Feb2021, the patient experienced felt like she had Covid plus the flu with outcome of recovered on 05Feb2021, very congested chest with outcome of recovered on 06Feb2021, flu like symptoms with outcome of recovered on 05Feb2021, chest pain with outcome of recovered on 05Feb2021, cough with outcome of recovered on 06Feb2021, shortness of breath with outcome of recovered on 06Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included oxygen saturation: normal on an unspecified date, sars-cov-2 antibody test: positive  on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of felt like she had covid plus the flu, flu like symptoms. The events were described as follows: Patient said that she had some weird side effects from the 2nd vaccine, but not the first dose and believes that she had Covid in Dec2020.  Patient said that she had flu like symptoms, she said it felt like she had Covid plus the flu. She said that she also had chest pain, a very congested chest, a cough, and shortness of breath. She did not have that with Covid. She said that her symptoms came on about 10 hours after the vaccination and were gone within 48 hours.  Patient said that she does not know if having Covid so recently plays into it at all. Patient said that she received the last dose on 03Feb2021 at 1130. Patient said that the phlegm started in her throat and she had the chills. She woke up with the whole shebang. She stated that it got worse by the next day. She said that she did not feel a thing from the first injection and had no side effects. She never tested positive for Covid in Dec2020. Her mother ended up positive for Covid and she was exposed to her and showed symptoms. She had exhaustion vertigo, and general feeling of being unwell with Covid. She had all of that again, but she was told not to expect anything respiratory. She got concerned with the chest pain, cough, phlegm, and shortness of breath.  She saw the doctor on 05Feb2021 and she was instructed not to take anything because it could affect the vaccine, but her symptoms went away within 48 hours.  She said that she felt like the congestion felt like a allergic reaction for her, said that it was hard to swallow, and had a lot of phlegm in her throat. She said that it is not inherently different if you were allergic to flowers.  Chest pain she described like you are full of phlegm and like there is inflammation. Shortness of breath: Feel panicky when you try to breath and you feel the phlegm. Patient said that when she gets sick she does have a tendency to get upper respiratory infections. Like with a cold that she would end up with a cough that would linger a little bit. She still thinks getting the vaccine was worth it. She just wished that it would have been a listed side effect, because when it is not, you panic. Most people are worried about the shortness of breath. She reported that her O2 levels were ok when she checked.   Doctor gave her a vitamin IV to make her feel better. Told her that her lungs were clear and it was all upper respiratory.

                                                About 10 mins post vaccine my throat started to feel tight and almost numb.....then I was having difficulties swallowing, as if there was a lump in my throat......a few mins later my inner ears felt like they were burning and I felt pressure.  I asked staff if symptoms were a side effect of vaccine at 15 minute mark from waiting period.  They had me sit back down for another 15 mins and paramedic come see me.  I told him I felt fine other than my throat feeling like it was as getting tighter and the difficulty swallowing.  He offered to take my stats and I asked him to wait to see if symptoms would dissipate.  After approx 49 mins of waiting from initial shot dose, my heart felt like it was racing and my throat felt tighter and I was now having a much harder time swallowing and I felt lightheaded.   They took me back and hooked me up to get my vitals.  About 7 mins later they brought an EPI Pen and I administered the shot in my leg.  After approx 10mins &#43;/- I began to feel my throat loosening a little.  Then over the next 10 mins or so I felt almost normal with little trouble swallowing.  They told me that I needed to go to the ER for further Eval.  I arrived  at ER approx 15 mins later and they gave me 2 Benadryl and 2 steroid pills and monitored me for the next 4 hrs - I was released shortly after - and again no other pain or side effects after EPI Pen and meds they administered.   Sent home with EPI Pen and Steroids and instructions on what to watch for.

                                                10 minutes after shot first noticed increased pulse, then lips and tongue tingling/slight swelling. Throat tight. Some dizziness. Some chest pain. Some itching (especially scalp and sole of feet and then some on arms). Stayed where medical professionals could see me for about 2 hours. Took Benadryl about 3 hours later (after shot) and lingering symptoms mostly cleared up. 8 hours later still some itching and lips feel a little &#34;off&#34; still. Arm is normal vaccine sore. I have a strong history of repeated anaphylaxis (from MCAS) and this didn&#39;t get too serious compared to previous reactions I had to be hospitalized for.

I inform the nurses and was immediately taken to the ER where they noticed that my tongue was extremely swollen my throat was beginning to swell and that I had raised up bumps and lesions starting to form on the back side of my tongue. ER staff admitted me and began me on a IV steroid treatment accompanied with Pepcid and Benadryl After 2 hours in the ER under close observation my tongue was still swollen and my windpipe was in danger of being closed off so I was transported via ambulance to Hospital and admitted to Intensive Care Unit where they continued to administer steroids and Benadryl. By 2 a.m. my condition had not improved and I was given an EpiPen in my arm. The EpiPen did help but by 6 a.m. my tongue swelling had returned but not as severe. On march 24th The hospital then moved me from the ICU  to the cardiac wing to be placed on a heart monitor as they continue to administer steroids, Benadryl, and Pepcid. I was given another Epi Pen by 11 a.m.  in the cardiac  care unit due to my tongue beginning to severely swell again.  As of today, March 25th My tongue continues to swell and they still have me admitted to the hospital as they continue to observe me and continue to administer steroids and Benadryl all via my i.v. port. Today they are going to begin me on an oral Prednisone.

                                                Patient is a 48yo female presenting for her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She reported a prior reaction with first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with throat tightening and some chest tightness onset approximately 13 min after receiving the first vaccine dose. She took oral Benadryl and was monitored by EMS  with complete resolution of symptoms after approximately 20 minutes. She did not require transport or hospital evaluation but saw her allergist for evaluation prior to presenting today for second dose. She was advised by her allergist to proceed with second dose of vaccine given her comorbidities and risks associated with COVID-19 infection. This medical evaluator reviewed risks with her, and possibility for allergic/adverse reaction with her second dose of the vaccine, and she chose to proceed with vaccine. She was initially doing well and was positioned next to EMS for close monitoring. Approximately 20-25 minutes after receiving second dose of the vaccine, she started to have a dry persistent cough, with some upper airway wheezing, no stridor or retractions, with auscultated normal breath sounds and good air exchange however with noted slight increase in respiratory effort and pale skin color, no diaphoresis. She took oral benadryl 25mg at 11:27am, but cough persisted and she developed lightheadedness and was transferred to the ambulance from her personal vehicle.10L oxygen was placed by nasal cannula. Within a few minutes, cough improved and skin color improved. Breath sounds continued to be clear with good air exchange. No wheezing or stridor or retractions were noted during this evaluation. She was transferred to another stretcher and oxygen removed, to allow for transport to the hospital via another ambulance. Within a few minutes off oxygen, cough returned. She was then transferred to local hospital for further monitoring and evaluation.

                                                The day after receiving the shot I developed pain in my entire arm from armpit to fingers. Pain became severe by day 3. Pain spread to my right breast, neck, back, and right scapular area. I have had numbness in my fingers on right side. Today is 16 days. The pain increased every day for about 10 days. Decreases slightly and is now holding.  I&#39;m am in terrible pain. I didn&#39;t sleep for 6 days when the pain was at is peak and still can barely sleep. It&#39;s the worst pain of my life. It feels like my arm is in fire and in a meat grinder. My arm and neck pain worsens when I use my arm or change positions. I am also getting flushed heat feelings on my face intermittently.  Since this vaccine I have had allergic reactions to ibuprophen and prednisone which sent me to the ER. Two medications I have received before with no problem. I also felt I was reacting to gargling with listerine which I have used before without issue.  I eat eggs regularly and got a small sensation of throat swelling with that too and have not eaten them again. My doctor is having trouble treating me since I am now having so many allergy symptoms to different things. I have been advised by my doctor not to continue with this vaccine or any vaccine in the future. I am still in terrible pain that is limiting me from participating i. my normal life activities.  I did not develop any rashes or obvious swelling at the injection site. Twenty minutes after receiving the shot I did get a bit flush feeling and some redness in my face and my ears felt hot and then cold. That resolved within about 45 minutes.

Had my own kit of epic pen, steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl. Injected myself because the MA at site injected herself and not me, so had another. Did pen, 2 Benadryl, 2 20mg prednisone, I Prevacid. Drove to urgent care and had them monitor me. All the about seemed to work to relieve the swelling and not gonna watch myself for 24 hours.   I have environmental allergies and have reacted to 3 allergy shots with similar symptoms listed above. Had to stop doing them. Please look at people with severe allergies as a group to not require these shots.

                                                About 3 weeks after my first dosis of the Pfizer vaccine, I started having constant numbness in both arms, hands and right legs, dizziness, pins and needles, extreme fatigue, lethargy, feeling the pulse of my heart rate in various part so my body in an opressive kind of way like in my throat, under my right breast, in my back on the ribs usually. All these symptoms never subsided and became noticeably worse a few days after my second dosis on April 8th.  My arms are always numb when I get up and become worse when hanging down, of course, but with different intensity.  I am feeling extremely dizzy as I walk around and unstable. Walking feels like the ground is further than it is in a way. I do notice a slight shortness of breath but more of an oppression in the rib cage than panting. I have been avoiding walking far or walking my dogs all together. I am not seeing any improvements even after my visit to the Urgency Care where nothing wrong was found on blood work and EKG. I was told to reduce inflammation with dietary supplement and some vitamins. I cannot work of course and what is a bit frightening now is that I am not improving on day 8 of my second dosis! Same rotation of weird symptoms all day (feeling my blood not circulating normally if that can be described even, numbness, pins and needles in arms, and right leg. Sometimes it affects my right cheek. Dizziness and unstability to walk around. Vision is lower as well. Too weak to do anything constructive.    My legs feel like they are not reliable (never have had that feeling at my age). It is more than feeling like a zombie, it is feeling too weak to do anything and my head is sometimes spinning. The numbness can be painful as a sudden thrust in an arm ( this does not last more than a few seconds).  It has now been going on since week 3 of my first dosis and today is day 7 of my second dosis! I had 0 symptoms on the first 2 weeks of my vaccine, dosis one. Now, I don&#39;t see any progress, rather a slight worsening of all the symptoms above. It is freakish not knowing what I have, of course. One can imagine, so stress adds to the mix sometimes during the day. I would not dare to even go walk my dogs now. A short grocery store visit at the most.

A 48-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: Unknown, Expiration date: Unknown) via unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 28Jan2021 13:20 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization.

The patient experienced adrenaline rush, heart was beating fast, blood pressure was up and felt agitated from 01Feb2021. She had the Pfizer vaccine on 28Jan2021 and four days later at work she felt like she had an adrenaline rush that lasted for 3 hours. It felt like her heart was beating fast, her blood pressure was up, and she felt agitated. It was unusual. It seemed to stop and she went to sleep at 20:00. She woke up at 22:00 and her heart was beating out of her chest and she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe. Her Apple watch showed her heart was beating at 140 sitting still. She went to the hospital. It stopped after 45 minutes, maybe an hour. Her oxygen level was low when she got to the hospital. It was 92 and her blood pressure was up. She has just a higher level of agitation. She is not sure if that is the immune system. She snapped at someone at work and she has never done that. Her heart rate and blood pressure have resolved completely. The agitation is still there. She went to the ER on 02Feb2021. It resolved in the ER, so she was not admitted. She had no more racing heart that day. Her blood pressure was up in the ER. The agitation comes and goes. She gets that way when her adrenaline is going, if her blood pressure is up, or if she takes a steroid. Any kind of adrenaline reaction. She hasn&#39;t used them for so long. She did not reacting well to it. They checked her thyroid level. She had AFib two years ago because she was on too high of a dose. She was on the same brand of Tirosint, but higher dose. The dose may have been 200mg but she is not sure. She is not absolutely sure what dose she was on at that point. She wasn&#39;t on Liothyronine at that time. The patient visited the emergency room as she thought she was having a heart attack. It scared her. she is going to talk to her cardiologist to make sure it is ok for the second dose. The outcome of the events heart was beating fast and Blood pressure was up recovered, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 48-year-old, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6198) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Huntington&#39;s disease diagnosed in 1995, due to this her voice crackles a bit. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9263) at the age of 48-year-old, for COVID-19 immunisation and she experienced 4 days of severe nausea, vomiting, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t eat, and diarrhea. The patient got her second dose on 17Mar2021 and had worsening of nausea, vomiting and fatigue on an unspecified date. The patient couldn&#39;t keep food down, can&#39;t sleep and keeps falling down, and he states &#34;that really concerns me, she&#39;s going to knock her teeth out or bleed in her brain, that&#39;s not good&#34;. She&#39;s barely able to get around, doesn&#39;t leave unless she has a doctor&#39;s appointment. The problem is this, it&#39;s not the vaccine, it&#39;s the genetic modification this patient has Huntington&#39;s disease she was told it was safe, but don&#39;t think they took into consideration that it&#39;s a genetic modification and she has Huntington&#39;s which was also the genetic modification, don&#39;t know what to do at this point. He mentions that her nausea and dizziness was getting worse now that were a month out. She&#39;s falling down more than before. He wants to help her keep down food because she lost approximately 10% of her body weight. She&#39;s dizzy and weak, he states &#34;she&#39;s wiped out, not sleeping&#34;. He also mentions that she&#39;s had hospitalizations. The reported was asking what do to next and if there was an on-staff physician for special cases. Patient reports going to the hospital 8 days after the second shot, she wasn&#39;t eating or sleeping. The second shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine was on 17Mar2021, patient began having severe vertigo, falling down, breathing hard, afraid she was going to knock her teeth out or break a bone, insomnia on an unspecified date. Patient reports she took a sip of water and threw up all over the side of the car today 20Apr2021. The Doctor states that this was not normal for her. Patient and reporter stated that the patient has lost between 10-15 lbs, about 10% of body weight. Reporter states that Ivermectin comes in custom lozenges and that it gets rid of inflammation so that it doesn&#39;t hurt the whole body. Ivermectin can make the GI upset. Caller states that it was not actually a vaccine that Pfizer was offering, reporter explains that Huntington Disease was when there was a repetitive code in the DNA, to the point it effects muscles and nerves and renders you. What Pfizer and Moderna was offering was a genetic modifier, mRNA was a genetic modifier, not a vaccine. In a Vaccine, they take a piece, make sure its dead, expose it to you and your body makes an antigen, that&#39;s a typical vaccine but this is not. Patient says Friday Saturday and Sunday she was stuck in the house. She cannot do anything. Reporter says the patient needs professional help. Her voice fluctuates so people take her seriously. (institute name), told the patient it would be ok to take the Pfizer COVID vaccine, but they didn&#39;t take into consideration is it was a genetic modifier. This was not a typical vaccine. Reporter states that he needs help escalating this please help with escalating this, needs help to know what to do for this patient because of the MRNA genetic modification. The mRNA may have affected the Huntingtons. The events resulted to hospitalization except for vertigo and breathing hard. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At 6 days after my second COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine (first dose given 12/17/20), I had acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath prompting a trip to the Emergency Department.  A chest CT Angio to rule out pulmonary embolus was done and negative for pulmonary embolus. My EKG showed some mild ST changes and a troponin I level was elevated at 0.08 (normal 0.04). Subsequent troponin levels 90 minutes apart showed a rising troponin at 0.18 and 0.38. An echocardiogram was performed which showed regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 45%. I was then taken to cardiac catheterization lab for coronary angiograms which were normal. My LV angiogram was consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and my LVEDP was elevated. I was started on a beta blocker and sent home the following day.

A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899 and expiration date not provided), intramuscular in the left arm on 06Jan2021 16:00 (at the age of 49 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included psoriasis, microscopic colitis, allergies to shellfish, and coconut. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took estrogen patch, etanercept (ENBREL) and sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergies to all. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and did not take any other medications with 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. On 06Jan2021 16:15, the patient experienced a very warm flush feeling, nausea started and by 15 minutes, she had swelling of the throat and rash on her arms and abdomen and the palms of her hands were bright red. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient was treated with diphenhydramine hcl (BENADRYL), steroids (unspecified), famotidine (PEPCID) and ondansetron (ZOFRAN) in response to the events. The patient assessed the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequel on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                29 minutes after vaccine was given i felt tingling and numbness on my left cheek and left side of my lips. i informed nurse and she began taking blood pressure and oxygen levels while asking if i was breathing ok.  i said yes. i then felt the right side of my lips go numb.  i felt a faint tightness in my throat but after about two minutes it felt like my right side of the lips started to feel normal and my throat.  then all at once i felt the blood rush from my body and tingling all over. i told the nurse i didnt feel good. she layed me down on the floor and put my feet up. she asked what i was feeling and i said i felt like i was going to faint.  i was aware that my tongue felt heavy and i wasn&#39;t talking clear. another nurse got the allergist or doctor on standby and she asked me what i was feeling. i just rubbed my throat and my cheeks and lips and felt numbness and my throat tight and my tongue very thick. she asked if i was having a hard time swallowing. i nodded so she said they were going to sit me up because they needed to give me an Epipen. i nodded, tgey brought a wheekchair for me and as they helped me stand because i had no strength, a nurse stabbed me with the Epipen then they took me to the emergency room and observed me until 2:30pmish to make sure i didnt have another episode. then i wss discharged and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor within 3 days. An  allergist will also see me to do a skin test.

                                                At night on the day of the vaccine I started with a headache, a dull headache, nothing sharp, really tired and my body was achy. My left arm was sore.  The next day roughly the same symptoms throughout the day, really tired and just kinda achy. On a Holiday after I had the vaccine, when I took the ibuprofen, my husband realized he lost his sense f taste and smell and he realized he was the same way the day before. He got tested Saturday the day after the Holiday and since I was still achy on Saturday I called employee health and they told me to get tested. I was tested through Employee Health ( employee only testing site). I still get tired really quick, I get winded really quickly even after doing chores at the house, like laundry and even if I am sitting still, I still sometimes am short of breath. The dull headaches are still present. I had lost my sense of taste and smell but those came back.

A 49-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1685; expiration date: unknown), intramuscular left arm on 18Dec2020 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included wheezing, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. She was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination. The patient has no known allergies. It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included salbutamol sulfate (ALBUTEROL) for wheezing, fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT HFA), hydrochlorothiazide, losartan potassium (LOSARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE ACTAVIS), pravastatin, colecalciferol (VIT D3), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000), latanoprost and metformin. The patient did not receive other vaccine in the last four weeks. On 18Dec2020, the patient reported that she received her first Covid 19 vaccination shot in a hospital and shortly thereafter became lightheaded, dizzy, mildly short of breath, and developed a headache. She further reported that her symptoms occurred approximately 10 to 15 minutes (reported onset time of 08:00 PM) after receiving the shot and started after she walked a short distance and then sat down when she became mildly short of breath, had one episode of chest tightness that since resolved. She also had acute onset 6 out of 10 left-sided frontal headache that has stayed constant since onset. She feels that the room is spinning around her however does not feel that she is presyncopal. The impression was vasovagal reaction with mild allergic reaction to vaccine. The adverse events resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit and treatment was received for the adverse events which included ketorolac 15mg x 1 dose, meclizine 25mg x 1 dose, NaCl 1,000 mL bolus. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the events cannot be excluded.

Terrible head pain and earache - amoxicillin for my ears; Dexamethasone  - for steriod for the body aches and pains; Norco - or Hydrocodone - I took that as a half a pill a night for 3 or four nights. Z-pack for three or four nights when I started getting chest congestion.  I was off work until 15th when I went back to work. I was not 100% but tired.

Was 24hours of dry heaving; called in sick on the 20th but felt better by the afternoon.  Hospital to get the prescription for the ear pain (it might have been on the 5th or 6th of January in the middle of the night).

                                                came to the vaccination appointment with no current illness or cough.  Within less than 5 minutes after the injection started with a cough that is similar to asthma attack onset.  As talking with the nursing staff on site after waving them over I began to get worse very quickly. Within minutes I heard one of the staff say &#34;she&#39;s crashing, move it&#34;.  At that point I could not breathe, audible wheezing, shortness of breath, throat was closing, entire body felt like it was on fire, extreme itching on back (especially upper back), shaking/convulsing, incoherent.  Paramedic staff was put into place and i was ambulanced to the hospital across the street from the vaccination site.  Everything is a whirlwind at this point and treatment from what I can remember was albuterol svn, atrovent svn, use of cpap,  epipen administration in the parking lot, benadryl via iv, solumedril, oxygen and pepcid.  Once arrived at E.R. I was aggressively treated.  Once stabalized began to wheen off the oxygen onto room air.  I am a rare asthmatic and my oxygen sats usually do not drop, although I am in distress.  At one point I heard oxygen sats were at 96, which is low for me.  I was discharged from the hospital to my husband&#39;s care.  In the next days now I am expriencing fever (100), itching, red rashy skin, severe headaches, joint pain, body ache, diarehha and extreme fatigue

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving vaccine, I experienced a gurgling sensation on the left side of the chest while breathing. That lasted for about 5 minutes and then dissipated. Throughout the day, I had intermittent chest pain. Upon going to bed that night I found I could not sleep on my right side because it hurt to breathe (primarily to exhale). On my back, I was okay. I had minor chest pain, all on the left side, the next day (3/18)  in the morning. By lunchtime it was gone. The evening of 3/18 (roughly 5:15-7:00), I experienced extreme chills. Finally put on my winter coat over my sweatshirt to get warm.

A 49-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location; Arm) on 22Jan2021 13:00 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included biotin from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 29Dec2020 (around 10:00 am to 12:00 pm at a hospital) and had the usual side effects of a little bit of nausea, developed a dry cough, some fatigue, and diarrhea and that kind of stuff. The reporter called about the Pfizer COVID vaccine and was calling on behalf of his wife who was the patient. Reporter stated that before the Pfizer COVID vaccine, patient used to walk the dogs 6 miles a very fast pace and had no problem, then she got her 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 29Dec2020 and had the usual side effects of a little bit of nausea, developed a dry cough, some fatigue, and diarrhea and that kind of stuff. The reporter stated that after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, the symptoms she reported have worsened and the cough, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea began immediately after the 1st dose of the vaccine where the cough started a week or so after the 1st dose and then after the 2nd dose, the cough never went away and got worse and worse and worse. Reporter stated the fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and cough were all ongoing and have gotten worse. Reporter mentioned that for the cough after the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, it was still there but was occasional and was not too bad but when the patient had the 2nd dose on 22Jan2021 and was knocked on her butt for about three days; also stated that the patient had fever, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and the works and had all the symptoms. It was also reported that the patient was very sick for 3-4 days with same symptoms. Reporter mentioned that fatigue was getting worse and the cough never went away and always had the dry cough which was getting worse and worse and worse with any activity and was a dry cough and she never had any phlegm. Reporter also stated the patient got to where she did less and less activity and was worse and the dry cough was worse with nothing coming up. It was reported that the patient sought treatment for everything she believed last week on Monday but was unsure of the dates. Monday of last week, patient went to the emergency room in a hospital and was told that they thought that the patient had an enlarged heart and severely low potassium and the patient was put on an IV drip of potassium because she could not tolerate the oral potassium and threw up the oral potassium so she was put on two bags of IV potassium. On an unknown date, it was reported that patient started having pain in her chest from the IV drip of potassium but she was released from the emergency room and the 2nd day of last week which was the next day, patient went back to the emergency room because she was having issues and everything was getting worse. Reporter also stated that the 2nd of last week, the patient collapsed and an ambulance came and got her on Tuesday of last week though reporter was unsure of the dates. Reporter also mentioned that patient went to a hospital and had severe chest pain and collapsed pressure on her chest. Reporter stated that the patient at that time had the dry cough and stuff and the hospital told the patient that the patient had fluid build up around her heart and lungs which was maybe due to the treatment from the IV potassium and was told she has a weakened heart. It was reported that with a weakened heart, the heart can&#39;t process fluid around the lungs and the heart and it puts pressure on heart supposedly. It was reported that on Wednesday last week, the patient went to the emergency room for the 3rd day in a row and already had an appointment with the HCP which was an appointment with her new primary Nurse Practitioner for the first appointment and she confirmed that the patient had fluid on the lungs when she saw the patient. Reporter stated that the nurse practitioner could not admit the patient because the hospital she admits too was full so she sent the patient to a hospital emergency room where they did all the tests and everything confirmed what they said and they transferred the patient to another hospital where the patient stayed in the hospital  a total of three days and was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and they started treatment on the patient. The patient was started on Entresto later on and tomorrow there was a follow up visit with her primary HCP and they have to follow up because the patient was released from the hospital and was very weak and she has to wear a lifevest because she is a heart patient and has a weak heart. It was reported that patient is going to be taking medications and stuff and will go see the HCP and they gave her beta blockers and other stuff and she will follow up with the HCP. It was reported that any of the medications including the beta blockers the patient was taking, reporter has no names of the medications, dosages or lot numbers or other information to provide at this time and stated that the patient was treated with those medications in the hospital and that was the hospital in another city and state. Reporter mentioned that it was last week when the patient collapsed while trying to walk across the yard and she was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy where part of the heart shrunk which is the expelling chamber of the heart and the HCP stated where a normal 20-30 year old would have heart function of 55, the patient had an output of 15. Reporter stated that the HCP said that stroke, disease or things like that can cause cardiomyopathy and there are various things that can cause it but they can&#39;t diagnose what caused this in the patient because she has not had various things and the only she had was the Pfizer COVID shots that hit her very hard and she just turned age 50. Reporter stated that the patient was age 49 at the time she began experiencing the symptoms that were reported and just turned age 50. Reporter clarified to state the potassium drip the patient had was not at this hospital but was at another hospital. Reporter stated he has no lot numbers, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide as he does not have the patient card for the Pfizer COVID Vaccine that the patient received and that paperwork is with the patient who is staying at her sister&#39;s house so the sister can help monitor the patient. Reporter also mentioned that patient was not taking medications at the time she received the Pfizer COVID Vaccine at that time but was taking over the counter Biotin and states he has no lot, expiry date or UPC to provide. Reporter mentioned that patient has no family history of heart conditions but he thinks the patient&#39;s mother is diabetic but she is the only who is diabetic and there is no other history he is aware of. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 49-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3249) as SINGLE DOSE, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Dec2020 (Batch/Lot Number: EK5730) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included: Caller states that there has been nothing relevant recently. Chronic allergies and sinus issues, Allergy induced asthma, allergic to pollen. A Flutter in 2012, Caller also had PVCs and Bigeminy on EKG around this time and caller had a Cardiac Ablation for treatment. Caller stated that she had a history of A. Flutter, related to Pneumonia that she had back in 2012, because some of the medications for the Pneumonia threw her heart out of sync. Caller states that she did have a cardiac ablation because the A. Flutter was proximal. Caller states that it took a while for the doctor&#39;s to diagnose her because it would only occur every once in a while, and just for a few seconds. Caller states that on EKG she was having PVCs and Bigeminy, but it never really picked up the A. Flutter, but of course the caller could feel the PVCs. Caller states that she has had none of the cardiac issues since this issue occurred in 2012. The patient confirmed that she had no other vaccines on the same day as either dose of the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included Unspecified Inhaler for allergy induced asthma. It was reported that, the patient received the COVID vaccine, the first dose on 18Dec2020 and she had the second dose on 06Jan2021, and recently, the caller started feeling some sinus allergies. She had chronic allergies. Caller stated that if her normal allergy medicines work, then she knew she was just having sinus allergies, but right now, caller stated her allergies are acting up. Caller reports that her symptoms started two to three days ago. Caller states that yesterday (25Feb2021), she had trouble breathing, but caller does have a history of allergy induced asthma. Caller states that she just had her windows replaced and she is allergic to pollen so she thought the dust being kicked up by her windows being replaced may have been the culprit of her symptoms, but she went to the doctor because she knew she had a sinus infection, and she also had some symptoms that are not typical of her sinus infections, including chills and body aches. Caller states that she told her doctor to test her for COVID, even though she has had both doses of the vaccine. Caller&#39;s COVID test came back positive. Caller states that she is a nurse herself, and she works in a hospital that is considered a COVID hospital. Caller does not work bedside but she does see some outpatient patients, as she is an anesthesia coordinator, and they do COVID testing on patients prior to their procedures. Caller reports that she had the COVID-19 Rapid test today, with the nasal swab. Caller states that it was a gut instinct on her part to ask for the test because she didn&#39;t think her symptoms felt real different from her normal chronic allergies and sinus issues, but she is sleepy and tired, she is having muscle aches and chills and a slight fever. Caller states that yesterday, she had a hard time breathing, and even though she does have allergy induced asthma, it seemed that even with inhalers, she was not able to breath normally. Caller states that the worst day of her symptoms was yesterday (26Feb2021), and today she feels a little bit better with her breathing. Caller states that if anything, the vaccine probably helped her with antibodies so that she is not having the COVID quite as severe as if it could be if she had not yet had the vaccine. She reported that about 2 to 3 days ago, caller started having symptoms and today, 26Feb2021, caller had a rapid COVID-19 test and she tested Positive for COVID-19. Outcome of the events she had a hard time breathing was recovering and all other event outcome was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information in the case report and a positive temporal relationship, a causal relationship between event COVID-19 and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

A 50-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, lipids (as reported) and asthma. The patient was known allergies: codeine, iodine, shellfish, latex, and cefatrizine propyleneglycolate (CEFTIN). Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in hospital. The patient experienced anaphylaxis and throat swelling on 22Dec2020 with outcome of recovered in Dec2020.  The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment of epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, observation was received for the events.    Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis and throat swelling cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 02Jan2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously took amoxicillin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and experienced allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced feeling close to loss of consciousness, intense chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath, and chills while driving home on 02Jan2021 at 12:00. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of feeling close to loss of consciousness, intense chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath, and chills while driving home was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling close to loss of consciousness, intense chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.   The underlying predisposing condition of penicillin allergy may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 15 min after injection my heart started racing and I got lightheaded. Heart rate was 95&#43; and BP was 190/90 something. My resting HR is 56 and BP is usually around 120/80.  Began to drop after about another 15 minutes. Followed by migraine for the rest of the day.    Felt okay when I woke up, but had one episode during the day today in which my heart rate shot up again and was a little short of breath even though I was not exerting myself. Lasted about 10 minutes.  Injection site hurts to the touch, but otherwise is painful.   Throat hurts a little and a little congested, but probably unrelated.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

I was taken to the ER by car and had labs and work up in the ER.  They were unable to determine if symptoms were vaccine related or not.  I had taken first dose of hypothyroid medication on 1/14/21.

The edema in my hand resolved the first day after the Benadryl dose.

                                                I had a reaction to the vaccine and wanted to make sure you were aware. I had a very similar reaction to Kenalog about 4 years ago. Within minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel like my body was racing a little. My foot started tapping and I felt hyperactive. At the end of my 15 minute wait time, I spoke to the physician that was in the room. I told him I was having a mild reaction and asked him if it was still okay for me to get the 2nd dose. He said yes, but he also took me over to another person to give me some Benadryl, just in case it got worse. They gave me 50mg of Benadryl and asked me to wait another 15 minutes to give it a little time to kick in. My reaction kept getting worse. I started itching all over and the hyperactive feeling became worse. She offered to use an epipen. I declined and  asked to wait another 15 minutes. At the 30 minute mark after taking the Benadryl, they called their EMT team because I continued to get worse. The team took me over to the ER. While they were pushing me there, my breathing started coming faster like I was panting. As if I had just gone for a run. Once I was in the ER, a physician saw me pretty quickly but it took a while until he came back to see me. I do not know how long it was. I would guess about 45 minutes to 1 hour. While waiting for the doctor the second time, it felt like my body started slowing down. Within 10 minutes, I felt like i had no energy left. I couldn&#39;t lift my arms. I was wide awake and could understand everything. But, all I could do was lay there. The ER doctor ordered oral Prednisone, IV Pepcid &amp; IV Benadryl to be given immediately. He sent me home with prescriptions for the Prednisone and Pepcid since I already have Benadryl. He also recommended I not get the second dose and follow up with my PCP.

Short of breath and my heart was going faster than normal and short exertion. So I took an antihistamine - Allegra; tums; Tylenol; and took Prevacid.  It didn&#39;t work. I was worried about my heart and that pressure on my throat. I went to my Dr. appt - she was able to get me in at short notice -  and she examined me and did blood work and chest x-ray. Gave prednisone and albuterol . She said my lympyh nodes were swollen on my neck. Symptoms have resolved. And on second dose of vaccine I felt fine. But still have irregular heartbeat but I have a cardio appt coming up. I&#39;m wearing heart monitor - Zeo - I mailed that on the 14 of January.

A 50-year-old female patient  received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), intramuscular in left deltoid on 22Dec2020 07:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccination was done in a hospital. There were no relevant medical history and concomitant medications. On  to 22Dec2020, she said she feels like she has had a severe reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she was not doing so great.  Reported she received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 22Dec2020 at 7:00AM in her left Deltoid. She said she had a reaction after receiving the first dose of the COVID- 19 Vaccine. She said her lips were tingling slightly, clarifying her lips were swollen too. She said she took some Benadryl (she clarified she did not have the Benadryl NDC/UPC, Lot or Expiration Date), and the Benadryl took away the lip tingling and swelling. She said she was tachypneic, and developed muscle pains (clarified as myalgia), joint pain, severe headache, weakness, and nausea. She said she also was really pale, so much so, that her husband was scared for her. She said the symptoms lasted for about 3 days, but the weakness lasted longer. Reported she took some Zofran disintegrating tablets for her nausea. Clarified she did have a PCR COVID-19 Virus test after she developed symptoms from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she had the PCR COVID-19 Virus test about 3 weeks ago, Dec2020 and the test was negative. She said she thought she had the COVID-19 Virus after receiving the first COVID- 19 Vaccine dose because no one else she knew who had the COVID-19 Vaccine had any issues. The outcome of the events joint pain,. myalgia, tachypnic, headache, pale and nausea was recovered on an unknown date in Dec2020; the outcome of the event tingling lips and swollen lips was recovered on 22Dec2020; while the outcome of weakness was unknown. The events were assessed as medically significant and causality was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close compatible temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the vaccination with BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

They asked me if I wanted to lay down. I said yes.  I was also very dizzy. My blood pressure was 135/83 and pulse was 125. my blood sugar was 102. I drank a bottle of water and laid down for 20 to 30 mins. Then sat in the chairs. I had to wait for the vision disturbance to wear off so I could drive.  it also gave me ADD symptoms for 48 hours. Very hyper.  Then I had the flu for 5 days. The dizzy wore off on the 6th day.    Should I get the 2nd shot?

                                                She received her 1st vaccine without any adverse or side effects.  Within 30 seconds of her 2nd vaccine she became flushed, within minutes she developed hives starting on her hands and then becoming more generalized, as well as itchy palms.  She also was hypertensive.  The COVID vaccine clinic administered epinephrine and transfer her to the emergency department where she was given prednisone, Benadryl, and famotidine.  ED notes do indicate she had some mild expiratory wheezing but on further discussion with her today this is a consistent finding after being diagnosed with asthma last year (more on this below).  She was monitored for over 3 hours and discharged home. Her itching resolved in the ED, hives resolved about 3 hours after discharge and other symptoms resolved around 24 hours post vaccine.   She did have labs drawn in the ED: troponin and C4 WNL. CBC showed leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and eosinophilia.   No personal history of seasonal, perennial, food, or bee sting allergies; asthma history as below. She did have an episode of bilateral eye swelling in December that was evaluated by her PCP; she was treated with benadryl &amp; prednisone and this took 3 days to resolve. She has no other history of anaphylaxis, hives or angioedema. She was able to show me pictures of this today.

On 26Jan2021, the patient tired so quickly even in her own place doing normal stuff, like cleaning and cooking. The patient used inhaler for short of breath which she usually did not use, like for year, and she saw it had already expired, and she got nervous that she saw it was expired, so she called her doctor to see if she could go, he said he was not receiving patients, all this stuff became so horrible. She tried to go to Urgent Care and they didn&#39;t see her, they said she had to go to the hospital, and she wanted to check her blood to see if she needs to receive the second shot or not, no one gave an answer, she doesn&#39;t know what to do, her second shot of vaccination was planned on 06Feb2021. Inhaler that was expired was Albuterol: expiry was Dec2020, lot DAEO68. During a call patient stated that the only symptom that worsened was short of breath. The patient wanted to know whether she could receive her second dose of vaccine. It was also reported that patient was not accepted in urgent care locations because she &#34;may have covid&#34; and was instructed to go to the ER (as reported).

The patient was recovering from the events back pain or the area of the lungs, more like sore on the throat, coughing a few times, throat pain and headache and not recovered from other events.

                                                &#34;The shot itself was very unpleasant,  the vaccine stung.  The nurse was concerned about this since it shouldn?t cause any discomfort at all.   Other than immediate onset of a painful injection site no other symptoms occurred until later in the evening.  I started feeling kind of yucky before I left work but nothing specific.  By the early evening I was running a low grade fever and having muscle and joint pain.   I didn?t sleep very well due to  body aches and severe organ pain.  At one point I woke up because my heart was beating so hard and fast I could feel it in my forehead.  My lips and eyes were swollen and my neck was visibly swollen as well, I think due to the lymph nodes in my neck.  My throat was some swollen but not enough to cause a breathing issue.  The heartbeat issue didn?t last terribly long.  I took a Benadryl to try and stop the reaction.  I ran fever of a 102 give or take a few degrees either way for 2 ½ days.  In addition, the injection site and whole shoulder area was swollen and  hot with redness that wrapped around the front of my arm.&#34;

I was really winded and the chest tightness got worse and my throat was closing.  I was rushed to the ER and given IV Benadryl and Steroids with Oxygen and I was discharged after 3 hours. I was able to control it for the next few days with Benadryl. I still felt short of breath for the first three days and I still have headaches and  since that event.  I did not have any previous allergies before this event and had had the first dose of the vaccine.

                                                I got the vaccine last Thursday, March 4, 2021 and I am experiencing strange side effects. I wanted to be sure to send this along to you as well as, to the adverse effect website. It?s almost as if I?ve had a stroke. Initially (after the shot), I was a little lightheaded but as the rest of the day wore on, (say around 6 hours later), I started to get foggy in my brain - like I had to remember to even breathe - and tightness in my chest like asthma. There was a high pitch scream in my ears and I was more or less, kind of out of it. My hands and feet were sweating profusely. My tongue kind of reacted, too and got a little burned, like when I eat pineapple. It was then that I noticed difficulty swallowing. My sister (a medical professional) suggested Benadryl for the mouth and tongue sensation and she kept an eye on me the rest of the night. She also warned that I should not get a second shot (I totally agree). Being a trooper, I thought all of the weird stuff would blow over in a day or two, so I decided to power on and not report my issues.  Today is day 6 post vaccine and I can now see a pattern to the symptoms or episodes which are still present, on and off:  1. The ringing in my ears will intensify, and then I stare off into space, my words get garbled (I have to really concentrate on being present), my tongue gets very dry and then the swallowing issue returns (it?s like slow motion swallowing, so I bite my tongue to stay in the moment).  2. The tightness in my chest intensifies and my breathing gets shallow. I must focus and breath through it despite discomfort. Note, since the shot, I keep a Benydryl and my inhaler with me, although I haven?t used Benadryl since day 3. I used my inhaler yesterday, day 5 because of discomfort and that seemed to help, but using it triggered an ear ringing/screaming episode that came and went the rest of the day.  3. I also have nasal constriction throughout the day. The nasal passage just inflames and then relaxes. I also have phantom smells and my sense of taste got a little off on day 1, but recovered. ________________  March 18, 2021 Update  Saturday, 3/13 went to the ER because the cognitive issues had advanced. I found myself staring off into space, losing my train of thought, and unable to speak. When I did speak I stammered or stuttered. They wanted to make sure I did not have a stroke or that I was not in the middle of one, so they did some tests. They also recommended that I go ahead and take the prednisone.  After my ER visit the cognitive issues continued, but began to be not-so-frequent by Sunday afternoon. I felt like I was on the road to recovery and so delayed again, taking the prednisone.  On Tuesday (3/16), I had what I would call an asthma attack. I was having very strong bronchial spasms that would not abate. I used my rescue inhaler to try to mitigate the symptoms, but that did not work. At the same time, the cognitive issues sort of returned and the big loud ringing and whooshing  in my ears was really really noticeable.  I am having a protracted allergic reaction to the vaccine. I am not normally allergic to things, but I have noticed new allergies since this all began. Certain food items seem to bother me now and push me into the lung seizing, raw tongue, neurological, ear ringing event.

A 50-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date) at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. During her 15 minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience throat tightness. Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to blood pressure abnormality, chest pain, collapse, hypotension, increased swelling, rapid progression of symptoms, respiratory distress, skin changes and tongue swelling. Treatment included: antihistamines. Follow up response to treatment: excellent. Patient discharge: Stable to go home and follow up with PCP. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be excluded based on the plausible temporal relationship and product safety profile.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ehics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Noticed my Heart rate was very high constantly between 100-115 ( on my wrist monitor) * On 4/5 Woke up and told myself to get moving for day, arm was turning very red at this point and swelling bad along with armpit along edge and was hot and still painful. Was up for 7 hr.. I got in shower that evening  and felt weird midway and my head felt like a whoosh and thought I was going to pass out (normal temp in shower) held onto shower got out was fine for about 20 min and then I started extreme shaking uncontrollably and teeth were chattering from chills. Went to get a Tylenol because I knew something was not right and within 30 min started sweating profusely with fever (I didn&#39;t even get up because I felt so crappy) *4/6 Woke up, felt a little better, arm, armpit and side of armpit red, hot and swollen still. Was up for 9 hrs, but when I went to bed and laid down, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe well...something told me to take a deep breath and I felt something like a pop in chest and then I felt like I was breathing better. Was not still feeling good  on 4/7  but went back to work, on 4/8 felt a lot better, then woke 4/9 with Migraine and felt terrible and my heart felt weird...I  called the Health Department and asked what to do and they recommended going to doctor... but a Nurse followed up with me which was very nice. Went to doctor and my Blood Pressure was 179/98 at that time. They ran blood work and prescribed me a antibiotic for my arm and armpit area. I want to add as well, not sure if this matters, but my shot was not in center of arm...it was closer to inner part of upper shoulder closer to chest.

                                                I received the first Covid vaccine on 2/25/21. I had bloodwork drawn related to my yearly physical on 3/11/21. They ran a CBC and basic metabolic panel. My CBC was normal and my levels specifically my Creatinine was completely normal. I received the second vaccine on 3/18/21. On 3/20/21 I started feeling a lot of pain in my abdomen area and was feeling really bloated. I was having a little difficulty breathing. I went to my PCP on Monday 3/22/21. They ran a CBC and a basic metabolic panel again. That afternoon, my PCP sent me for a CT scan of my abdominal and pelvic area. On the morning of 3/23/21, my PCP called me my Creatinine level ran the day before was at 5. Also my CT scan had come back.  I also had moderate ascites (fluid in my abdomen).  I also had a large right pleural effusion.  On 3/23/21, my PCP sent me to the ER for hospital admission.  I was in the hospital for 12 days.  I was in acute kidney failure.  They drained the fluid from my abdomen.  They inserted a temporary port and I had 4 rounds of dialysis.  On my 9th day in the hospital, the kidney doctor started me on 80 mg of Lasix per day.  My urine output increased dramatically and my creatinine levels began to drop. I had not had any issues prior to the kidney failure that would typically cause it to happen.  The only new medicine or change had been the Covid vaccine administration.  The kidney doctor and the hospitalist dismissed this idea.  I am reporting it because it was the only thing new and my levels had been normal less than 2 weeks before.

                                                Severe respiratory distress; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.   A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection),Lot# lot number: EL1284, intramuscular at right arm on 07Jan2021 12:00 PM,  at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. No known allergy , no other medical history.No COVID prior vaccination. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility .No any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No Concomitant medications (received within 2 weeks of vaccination) . On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced Severe respiratory distress that resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care.It was unknown if  treatment was received for the event. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal relationship between Severe respiratory distress and BNT162B2 cannot be completely ruled out considering the temporal relationship.  However, more information would allow for a full medically meaningful assessment, especially medical history, concomitant medications, concurrent illness and event details.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

She felt a little short of breath. She started to get fluid-filled blisters on bilateral palms. This is a milder form of the reaction pt has to flu vaccines (she was advised by PCP not to receive flu vaccines because of the blistering). Pt took diphenhyramine 25 mg PO x 1 and the fluid-filled blisters resolved within a few hours.  12/28 around 0330, pt awoke and felt like her right carotid was &#34;pulsating.&#34; Pt drank water, did not go back to sleep. &#34;Pulsating&#34; resoved within an hour. No other symptoms develped. In the morning, pt called employee health RN who instructed her to contact PCP and report the reaction.

                                                received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season belreathing, and a slight headache on my rr temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At approx 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At approx 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I have notice much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopefully, all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night. I have a history of whooping cough. And gastric bypass.

                                                Symptoms were first noted 12/24/2020. She had the Pfizer Covid vaccine at about 6pm. At about 10 pm she had mild chest tightness. It persisted for &gt;24. hours. She also had injection site soreness. She was tired for a day. If she talked a lot or got angry, she found it a little difficult to breathe. (Her mother was in the hospital and she had been talking a lot.) She did not have any other symptoms. She reports she was not stressed when she had the vaccine: her mother?s stressful problem started in January. The patient?s symptom severity is rated as: ?mild,? ?not very severe.? If she did not talk, she did not feel anything. The SECOND DOSE was given at my office. The Covid vaccine was administered and the patient was observed for two hours. This was from Pfizer-Biontech Lot EL3246, expiring 4/2021. She had some chest tightness and was given an albuterol nebulizer treatment. Her symptoms resolved and she was discharged to home. I phoned her the next day. She had mild dyspnea the day after the vaccination that resolved that night. She did not have a fever, but did have local soreness, fatigue, body ache, and a headache, for which she took Tylenol.  She did see her primary care physician and they discussed the patient?s anxiety due to her mother?s poor health. An EKG will be done.

A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 03Jan2021 at 10:00, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies (unspecified). The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient experienced 3 &#34;waves&#34; or what her many coworkers were describing as &#34;whooshes&#34;. The first two occurred minutes apart approximately 4-5 minutes post vaccine-last less than one minute each. The 3rd wave occurred after lunch approximately 3 hours later-lasted approximately 2 hours but not as intense as the first times. The patient further described the symptoms as &#34;felt like a rush&#34; (unspecified) experienced when receiving epinephrine. She was short of breath, lightheaded, dizzy, like pre-syncope as she felt like she could pass out but did not do so. The events occurred on 03Jan2021. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.

                                                about 15 to 17 minutes after vaccine I got a warmth thru my whole body and my heart started racing. I also had a headache. I was taken back to medic area and was assessed. My oxygen was good but my pulse and BP were high.  I layed down and after 10 minutes felt better and my pulse recovered.  Shortly later I was told I could go home.  I sat up and felt briefly dizzy then my heart started racing again (pulse 137).  I layed back down and EMS was called. By the time they arrived my pulse had slowed to normal but I still had a headache. This was about 45 min after vaccine.  They performed an EKG and monitored my vitals as I sat up and then stood up. I did not have any incidents of my heart racing but my BP was 157/98 so I was told they could take me to EC for monitoring or to my doctor.  I chose to go to my doctors.  I arrived at my doctor an hour later and still had elevated BP and headache . He chose to monitor me. I had another incident where my heart started to race so he gave me liquid Benadryl and let me rest.  I think I had one more milder incident of my heart racing but it was not as strong.  After about 3 hours I went home and was told to monitor for Anaphylaxis. I went home and slept 3  hours and woke up feeling fine.  I was fatigued for next 3 days but not issues with heart. About day 5 I was working and had a couple of incidents where I felt my heart pick up a little bit and I couldn&#39;t catch my breath.  After that I feel like I was fine and don&#39;t remember any more incidents.

Was feeling better and about 90 minutes later felt warmth over my heart, my lips and mouth became tingly and both arms went numb and uncertain if my heart monitor showed abnormal. Was admitted overnight for observation. About 10 hours later had warmth in my chest, heart started beating fast, numbness in arms and around mouth and slight tightness in throat. Benadryl administered and heart calmed after couple of minutes, numbness went away after couple of minutes and tightness in throat went away after an hour.  Again about 13 hours later the warmth in chest and heart racing only symptoms. Given another dose of Benadryl. The symptoms only lasted a couple of minutes.  I also saw a cardiologist who ordered an echocardiogram just to rule out anything with my heart. It was normal.  I was sent home with instructions to use Bendryl oral for 3 days every 12 hours. I was told it could be from vaccine and I was to follow symptoms for 2 weeks and if not better to see cardiologist to look at other reasons.   I have taken the Benadryl for 3 days every 12 hours and did not have any other episodes with my heart.  I am on day 6 now and I have joint pain and headache.

I do not think it wise to be there for my shift in the next 8 hrs. I will stay and observe for additional  symptoms.     I was on vacay and had out-of-office notice set for my email. I discovered this email yesterday while catching up on emails.  I immediately called her. She described the details of the events; stated she has not sought medical care; all symptoms resolved spontaneously but still has some intermittent, mild SOB&gt;   She sent me this email describing the reaction: Here explanation of the reaction:     Thank you for the follow up. Below is a list of symptoms I experienced after I received my initial dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I am scheduled to receive my 2nd dose next week on the 13th of January.   following up:   I received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45 min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season breathing, and a slight headache on my rt temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At ~ 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At ~ 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I noticed much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopeful that all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night.&#34;  I advised she contact her PCP to determine if follow up is indicated given persistent, intermittent cough and SOB.

All my joints hurt - even my toe joints. I called my doctor. I had a fever.  That went away in 2-3 days. Two weeks later or so- on February 5, I started feeling pretty bad. I started having chest pains. It progressed. No coughing. By the 10th, I ended up in ER. I thought I was having a heart attack - chest pain I was hospitalized. I am still dealing with that issue. I received morphine I&#39;m diagnosed with Pleurisy -like virus - the lining of chest wall can become inflamed and when I breathe in and out it causes severe pain. Tachycardia - fast heart rate. I&#39;m on anti-inflammatory - Naproxen - 500 mg twice a day and I&#39;m already improving. I saw a cardiac dr today - he says my heart seems fine. I still have a fast heart rate. Pleural Rubbing - he could hear it on my chest wall. I had a positive antibody test - COVID -on January 20th. I&#39;m recovering but I am not recovered.

                                                A little nauseated following injection. By that afternoon felt very ill. Took Tylenol and went to bed. Basically slept for the next 36 hours. High fever?Tylenol only brought down slightly and back up within a few hours, severe headache that Tylenol didn?t help, nausea to point of unable to eat or drink because felt like going to puke, dizziness whenever tried to get up, would also get short of breath whenever tried to get up, raised heart rate, fatigue?I was so out of it that my husband had to occasionally wake me to make sure I was still responsive, terrible body aches to the point that it hurt to move.

                                                51 y/o female, no chronic health problems. 14 days following first COVID Pfizer vaccine, I felt unable to take a deep breath, on day 15 following the vaccine, I became short of breath,; on day 16 I was having mild chest pain with inspiration and shortness of breath;  day 17 following vaccination I became significantly short of breath, with moderate to severe chest pain with inspiration and tachycardia (heart rate in the 140&#39;s). I called my PCP who ordered an EKG, CXR, COVID swab, a metabolic panel,  a CBC, and a D-dimer. My D-dimer was elevated and he called me to go directly to the emergency department, which I did and had a CTA chest. I was diagnosed with multifocal pulmonary emboli in my right lung with a slight pleural effusion on my left lung. I had a duplex ultrasound of my legs which was negatve for DVT, and an echocardiogram which was within normal limits. I was finally diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism, given a Heparin bolus and started on a Heparin IV infusion. Ultimately, I transitioned to Eliquis PO and was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours.

I had headaches on the crown of my head for four days After the headaches subsided, I was really short of breath after five days and was unable to work. I am normally in good shape. I went back to the Emergency Room and they did more tests which was a week after the vaccine.

                                                The following is the timeline of progression: First 48 hours: Immediately following the vaccine I felt I would vomit. That lasted 2 hours. The remainder of the 48 hours I had a growing headache that turned into a migraine level. Cognitively my husband would say I was out of it, not able to focus. The area around my eyes  my eyelids and below eyelids bright red  like I had put a bright red blush on them. Three to four days later: Saturday night my symptoms started to progress over a span of a few hours very drastically. I had symptoms of Diarrhea crazy impact in my gut. Sunday I still had migraine level pain in a headache. I felt increased symptoms of nausea and diarrhea increased. Sunday I still had migraine level pain in a headache.  I felt increased symptoms of nausea and diarrhea increased. By Sunday afternoon I had full blown symptoms of stomach flu. I had chills, extreme nausea that became debilitating. We do not have a thermometer that works, as a result I do not know if I had a fever. By Sunday night I was vomiting and symptoms progressed to tightness of chest, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, chills. My gut was literally moving in sharp pain, sounds, and cramping. It was severe diarrhea. I was achy and tired, but could not fall asleep due to nausea and vomiting. I was unable to stand up without the fear of passing out. I tried to manage the nausea with medicine that I have at home. It assisted but did not ultimate make an impact. By 4:30 a.m. I was scared by the lack of breath and asked my husband to call 911. The paramedic stated that I had an increased heart rate, but good blood pressure. I went to the hospital and received fluids, two different additional doses of nausea medicine, oxygen and a gut muscle relaxer. After 30 to 40 minutes I showed improvement and was able to go home. Still had pink color tone in skin around my eyes. On that Monday (2/8/2021), I was unable to go to work and called in for Covid PTO. I slept most of the day. Five days later: Still have a headache that can be managed with Tylenol. I still have diarrhea. I no longer have nausea, the pink color around my eyes seems to be gone.The nurse team and ambulance team all stated that the second shot was awful. Three folks stated they were in fetal position for two days. I was not able to ask what that meant due to my extreme nausea and trying to not dry heave. Note: I did not have any symptoms from the first vaccine  just a dull headache.

A 51-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 21Feb2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 17Feb2021 15:40, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2012 to (diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus almost 9 years ago), neuropathy in her feet/nerves and reported that she only turns pink if she gets overheated. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Historical vaccines included influenza vaccine (reported as flu vaccine) which she gets every year and pneumococcal vaccine (reported as pneumonia vaccine) which she gets every 5 years. The patient reported that she received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 17Feb2021 and had an allergic reaction. She said she was at a podiatry appointment, and her podiatrist told her the pharmacy had an extra COVID-19 Vaccine available. She said the pharmacy staff came to her podiatrist&#39;s office to administer her COVID-19 Vaccine. She said about 5 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine injection, on 17Feb2021 15:45, her left arm started feeling flushed, her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck. She said 20 minutes later, she walked from her podiatrist&#39;s office to a nurse&#39;s station to be monitored further. She said while she was at the nurse&#39;s station, a doctor came by twice to evaluate. She clarified the upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red. She said her podiatrist asked her if that was a normal reaction for her. She said she told her podiatrist she only turns pink if she gets overheated. She said her left hand got numb and tingly. She said the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were &#34;twingey&#34;. She said her podiatrist and his nurse felt both her arms, and said her left arm was much warmer than her right arm. While she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored, she felt short of breath. She said she wasn&#39;t sure if she was short of breath because of her nerves. She said her oxygen level was checked and it was at 99%. She said her pulse was 101, her blood pressure was 118/76, and her blood glucose finger stick test was 128. She said she was told by the staff monitoring her, she should expect her blood glucose number to skyrocket because there is a steroid in the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said the staff also mentioned she can expect blood glucose spikes as the COVID-19 Vaccine&#39;s steroid goes through her system. Her fingers in her left hand became itchy while she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored. It was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers. She said she asked for an ice pack to put on her left hand because she uses ice packs for neuropathy in her feet, and she felt an ice pack would help with the itch and burning feeling in her left hand fingers. The doctor came to look at her again and wanted to give her IV Benadryl. Then the doctor decided against the IV Benadryl because she would be too sleepy to drive home but the doctor did eventually give her an intramuscular injection of Benadryl 25mg (clarified as Diphenhydramine 25mg in a syringe) in her upper right arm. Within 5 minutes the itching in her left hand fingers calmed down, and the redness in her left arm calmed down to a pink color. She said 20 minutes later her left arm was still pink and warm. She said she was told by the doctor if her reaction moved out of the localized area of her left arm, to go to the Emergency Room, and to use an icepack, again, on her left hand. When she arrived home, her husband said she looked like she had hives and a rash going down her left arm. Her left arm was not itchy though. She clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist. She reported that while she was at her podiatrist&#39;s office her left arm was a solid pink. She then mentioned that when she goes out in the sun and gets overheated, she turns pink. She said from her left shoulder to left elbow was warm to the touch. She said by the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site is sore and her left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. She reported there were no blotchy, red marks on her left arm on 18Feb2021. She said her left arm is a pretty normal on 18Feb2021. The nurse who monitored her after the COVID-19 Vaccine shot said she needed to report her allergic reaction. She was told she needs to let the COVID-19 Vaccine staff know of her reaction before she gets her second COVID-19 Vaccine injection, so she can be monitored closely. She took no other treatment after she returned home from receiving her COVID-19 Vaccine. She reported she had a headache on 18Feb2021, clarifying her whole head hurts, and the headache has been persisting all day. She said she experienced tiredness, as well. She said the tiredness started on 17Feb2021 and can be partially attributed to the Diphenhydramine 25mg injection she was given. Her husband told her she looked completely wiped out, and pale when she got home after getting her COVID-19 Vaccine on 17Feb2021. She said she remembers being tired when she got home because her eyes were squinty. She reported feeling more tired on 18Feb2021 and her whole left arm and left hand are sore. She clarified her blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events &#34;her fingers in her left hand became itchy/it was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers&#34; on 17Feb2021; from &#34;upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red&#34; and &#34;rash going down her left arm/clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist&#34; on 18Feb2021; from &#34;her left hand got numb and tingly&#34;, &#34;the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were twingey&#34;, short of breath, &#34;burning feeling in her left hand fingers&#34; and &#34;she looked completely wiped out, and pale&#34; in Feb2021; was recovering from &#34;left arm started feeling flushed&#34;; has not recovered from &#34;her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck/her left arm was much warmer than her right arm&#34;, &#34;blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021&#34;, &#34;there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site&#34;, &#34;Injection site pain/injection site is sore&#34;, &#34;left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site&#34;, &#34;looked completely wiped out/Tiredness&#34;, &#34;Headache&#34; and &#34;her whole left arm and left hand are sore&#34;.

I have been  taking Benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                I got my shot around 12:20pm. After about 10-15 minutes, my tongue felt strange (like it was larger or heavier) and my mouth was dry. I thought maybe I was just thirsty. Shortly after that, I felt a pressure toward the bottom of my neck, like someone was pushing their thumb on my lower neck. Then, I felt pressure going down my chest. I told the monitor, and she brought the nurses over. The nurses took me to a different location for monitoring. I took some benadryl at about 12:45 pm. At 12:55pm, my throat began to close up, and when I breathed in, it was like a tiny straw was in my throat. The nurses gave me an epinephrine shot and called the ambulance. This event happened on 3/20/2021. On 3/21, I was physically and emotionally drained. I still had a slight pressure going down my chest. On 3/22, I went to work and developed a headache and was nauseous and my stomach was cramping by 10am. I went to the allergist at 3pm. She told me to take non-PEG liquid benadryl and Pepcid AC. On 3/24/2021, I still feel like I have some tightness in my chest (very minimal but still present) and a headache and am continuing to take liquid Benadryl.

                                                I received the shot at 11:00 am. By 11:20 I was dizzy, lightheaded, my mouth was itchy and the back of my throat felt numb and had  a significant headache.  I could not sit up straight due to dizziness.  By 11:30 it was hard to talk, my throat felt thick, tight, and like it was getting small. It was difficult to swallow.  I was too dizzy to stand up. I would tip over when I stood up.  The hospital was called and advised my family to closely observe my symptoms.  At 11:20 the pharmacist gave me liquid Benadryl.  At 11:30 I took hydroxyzine, prescribed after an adverse reaction to my first covid vaccine and Tylenol.  At 12:30 my throat felt less enflamed but sore and scratchy.  At this time my whole head was itchy and the headache was not reduced.  I had a difficult time walking due to the dizziness.

A 51-year-old female received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number= EN6199) injected intramuscularly in left shoulder (left arm) on 09Mar2021 13:30 at age of 51 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), neurosarcoidosis (diagnosied 1997 with remission since 2002), high cholesterol, depression, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), osteoarthritis. Allergies to penicillin (no specific manufacturer, lot or expiration) in 1990. Obesity through all her life. No relevant test. Diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness. There was no family medical history. Patient was not pregnant. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. There were other medications in two weeks. There was not covid prior vaccination. There was no other vaccine in four weeks prior vaccinations. The adverse event patient experienced: lose of voice with shortness of breath with communication and chest tightening, fatigue. This similar to her neurosarcoidosis diagnosied 1997 with remission since 2002. The events started on 10Mar2021 11:30 AM. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine 1st dose.  She was losing her voice.  She was a pediatric Occupational Therapist. She was eligible on Tuesday for the first dose and went and got it.  Her main concern was the symptoms she was having was the same thing that comes out when her autoimmune was exacerbated.  She would like to know if it was safe to get next dose. When providing her weight, she said she was not a small girl. There was no prescriber. She was waiting to see if it would disappear before calling Pfizer to report it and it did not.  It started yesterday about 24 hours after the vaccine. She received it for prevention and for the population she works with. A lot of her kids she worked with were autoimmune compromised. The majority of her medications she had been on for over two years, so she did not feel they were relevant. No further details provided. No Emergency Room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. She called her physicians&#39; office and they suggested she contact Pfizer. Patient received covid tested post vaccination: nasal Swab/Antigen on 09Feb2021: negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was brought to the hospital by the ambulance because my throat swelled up.; eyes are tired; My body is itchy and feel like crap; My body is itchy and feel like crap; she&#39;s allergic to the Covid 19 vaccine; I was wheezing within 10 minutes after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 51-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot/Batch number: ER8732 and expiry date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 29Mar2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Multiple sclerosis (from 1996 to ongoing), 2006-2007, it was because of an MS drug (Interferon (receiving 3 times a week)), it gave her mild cardiomyopathy. She just stopped taking another treatment for multiple sclerosis called Mavenclad. Mavenclad is a chemotherapy drug. She received her first dose in Oct2020, she took Mavenclad for 5 days. Then in Nov2020 she started taking the Mavenclad again for 5 days. She doesn&#39;t restart the Mavenclad again until Oct2021. She reports the Mavenclad takes the B and T cells out of her bone marrow. When she has the next dose of Mavenclad, the B and T cells will be depleted again and when the B and T cells come back they are &#34;tricked&#34; so they won&#39;t attack her body. Her hair fell out in clumps with the Mavenclad and her throat swelled too. She would really like a haircut to fix her hair. She premedicated prior to receiving the Mavenclad. She reports she was premedicated for 3 days prior and the day she received the Mavenclad, with Benadryl. Within 15 to 20 minutes of taking the Mavenclad she had a reaction. Concomitant medications included vitamin b12 (about a year) for vitamin b12 deficiency and vitamin d (10-15 years) with calcium for Vitamin D deficiency. On 29Mar2021 within 10 minutes after receiving first dose her throat swelled up. The next thing she knows is people are all around her, she&#39;s on a gurney and she&#39;s going to the hospital in an ambulance. She would say she&#39;s allergic to the Covid 19 vaccine. In the emergency department she had to have an IV with all kinds of medications. Yesterday in the emergency department the doctor wanted to give her an epi pen. She told the doctor she didn&#39;t want to have the epi pen. In her IV in the emergency department she received Solu-Medrol, Benadryl (as needed), and Famotidine (20mg twice a day 10 days). She was prescribed Prednisone 20mg tablets, take 3 tablets orally every day for 5 days. She also reports she is allergic to egg whites, not deathly allergic. She can eat a hardboiled egg but she has to take Benadryl because her throat will start to close up. She can eat scrambled eggs just fine because the eggs are cooked different. The emergency room was watching her because if she didn&#39;t improve, they were going to give her the epinephrine. She started to improve, and she was thankful. She was afraid something else could have happened to her and her husband was in the parking lot and wouldn&#39;t have known. She&#39;s not sure how many hours she spent in the emergency room. She was not admitted to the hospital; she was discharged from the emergency room. Now she&#39;s taking medication for the next 5-10 days. She&#39;s not shocked, with her history and her reactions to medications. She didn&#39;t really think an allergic reaction was going to happen because the Covid 19 vaccine is not a live vaccine or anything like that. She&#39;s not going to look online for allergic reaction information because her eyes are tired. She&#39;s been up since 1:30 AM because of all the steroids she&#39;s on. On 30Mar2021, her whole body is itchy. She&#39;s taking Benadryl and the Benadryl has helped. The itchy feeling is moving on to different parts of her body. She had the swine flu when it came out and it was hellacious. She feels like Covid is much worse and she she believes in science. She knows Covid 19 isn&#39;t made up. She&#39;s all for the Covid 19 vaccine. Give her the Covid 19 vaccine so she can move on. She reports everyone in her family got the vaccine, and they were all fine besides aches and pains. When probing for specific information regarding the caller&#39;s family members, she reports her daughter, who is in nursing school had the Covid 19 vaccine. After her daughter&#39;s first Covid 19 vaccine, she had a sore arm that night and she was really tired. The next day her daughter felt a little lightheaded and she felt like she had flu symptoms. She had some body aches. Then under her daughter&#39;s armpit where her lymph nodes are were swollen. By the third day her daughter felt better. She was totally fine. She thinks her daughter may have reported her experience online. The outcome of event eyes are tired and I was wheezing within 10 minutes after receiving the first dose of the vaccine was unknown, the outcome of event My body is itchy and feel like crap, My body is itchy and feel like crap and she&#39;s allergic to the Covid 19 vaccine was not recovered where the patient recovering from the event I was brought to the hospital by the ambulance because my throat swelled up.

                                                Pfizer dose #1 EJ1686 1/1/2021 12:30 pm  Onset of symptoms 2 pm 1/1/2021, around 1.5 hrs post vaccine: severe headache, stiff neck ache, dizziness, nausea, chills, extreme fatigue, feverish but below 100.4, severe muscle aches, loss of taste and smell. Loose bowels at times, slept all the rest of the day and night, drank lots of fluids and electrolytes (low sugar). Felt more weak and dizzy the next day, and when walking felt veering right more, more issues with extended activity. e next dose on 1/22 onwards, and has never gone away fully.   R arm pain and raised, tender area at vaccine site contiued to hurt for weeks, even into the next dose on 1/22 onwards, and has never gone away fully.   1/3.2021 woke up 5:30 am sudden onset shortness of breath, deep lung pain in the center of the chest.  I felt like my R lung blocked, and started to cough up large amounts of clear mucus, and vomiting mucus due to airway feeling blocked. I did a 4 albuterol puffs to try to open my airway, but I was not wheezing, and did not have any respiratory symptoms or illness at the time before this started. I had been having continued less lung capacity for many months prior due to having been very sick in March 2020 onwards, including loss of sense of smell and taste, shortness of breath, deep lung pain, fever, No wheezing, not sick.    Pfizer dose #2 EL9261 1/22/2021 3:50 pm after work. Onset of symptoms by 5:30 pm with headache, dizziness, nausea, extreme fatigue, increased R arm pain at the vaccine site, but it was still hurting at the site from the 1/1/21 shot too, before this dose. Drank fluids and went to bed.  Loss of smell and taste returned 1/23/21.  Had continued bad headache from 1/22 onwards, with nausea and feeling more dizzy at times, and on 1/26/21 I was at work with increased headache, dizziness and nausea, and went home early from my shift (I am an RN) due to symptoms. Went to bed early, due to continued nausea and headache and dizziness at times. 1/27 continued bad headache, then in the afternoon around 3 pm, GI felt bloated, bad nausea, and then felt shortness of breath around 4 pm and faster heart rate in the upper 80?s  lasting for minutes, despite laying down in bed, so I too used my oximeter (I Have photos) and the sats were staying at 88% continuously, and had shortness of breath and return of deep internal mid lung pain, and this lasted for over 10 min. I used a canister of Boost oxygen for 5-6 puffs to try to recover, and the sats raised to 90%. No wheezing. Not sick. I had a bad headache and nausea, and was not feeling good and went to bed. On 1/28/21 I woke up at 5:30 with severe vertigo and dizziness, nausea and a bad headache  and could not walk due to the vertigo, and vomited when I was trying to have my head up. I had to crawl to the bathroom on my hands and knees. I called out sick for work due to this and contacted my DR. I was started meclizine 25 mg 3 times a day for vertigo, and was taking Zofran to help. 1/31/21 noted my Re upper eyelid was doing a lot of spastic twitching at times, that would stop and start, but did not think about it much.  The vertigo was unrelenting and then I started to have Right arm and hand weakness noted on 2/3/21 and was still very dizzy, nauseated and had a constant headache since I got dose #2 of the COVID vaccine on 1/22.  I was using a walking stick for the dizziness to be stable, and also felt weaker on the R side, and drifting to the right when walking .On 2/4/21 I had my first MRI (no contrast, unfortunately) and noticed I could not fully shut my Right eye in the MRI, and by 2/5/21 my face was drooping. I still had the constant headache, nausea and dizziness, and increased R hand, arm and R leg weakness and R hip weakness. I could not lift my R leg up to walk well, cannot grip well with the R hand, and uncoordinated, and cannot walk straight, and am unstable when trying to walk heel to toe, or even stand still with my eyes shut, and have had some double vision with the R eye. I was started on Prednisone  and on Klonopin for the vertigo on 2/9 after seeing my neurologist.  I took Prednisone for 5 days, from 2/9-2/13 and did not have improvement with the R facial droop or R side weakness and the headaches have persisted, along with some dizziness and nausea.  on2/14-15 I had increased shortness of breath and R lung felt like it was not inflating much, and got an xray, and went onto Zithromax for 5 days, which did help my lungs to improve, and I was able to breathe better, and got my Right lung capacity back.    I stopped the Klonopin after a week (2/9-2/16), to manage through the symptoms without it, and have been doing physical therapy and. Vestibular therapy. I had another MRI, with contrast on 2/25, after an in-person neurology appointment, and was having some improvement with the vertigo, so I started back to a desk job, not my RN job on 3/4/21, but I was still having the constant headache, nausea, and some dizziness, R face droop, R hand weakness, R leg weakness and walk with a walking stick, and have increased issues with exertion, but have been walking and doing therapies to get stronger.3 I started to have increased R facial droop. EMG done on 3/23 of my R arm.  Worse headache, nausea, dizziness at the desk, and fatigue, but R side weakness issues increased, so I started back onto Prednisone on 3/28/21 with 50mg day for 3 days, then 40mg for 3 days, 30mg for 3 days then 230mg for 2 days, but had increasingly bad headache,nausea and increasing R facial droop, and much worse R hand weakness, R arm weakness and pain, and R hip pain and weakness, worse walking, cannot lift my R leg or foot as high as the L, again, and am struggling to walk, and get worse with exertion with R side walking and weakness. I also had shooting pains in my R jaw start on 4/6-7, along with R jaw and face pain and increased numbness, more face droop shooting pains in my R hip, and arm and body pain and a worse headache making it hard to even sleep, and some increased issues with my R eye that I need to have checked. The prednisone last dose was on 4/7, and stopped due to the symptoms I was having, after a video visit with the neurologist. Increased R leg weakness, R weak hip vs left, R foot drag/drop, with increased issues to maintain walking with progressive walking, still using walking stick to try to walk, but now for stability and to keep from drifting, R facial droop increasing and now some R eye blurring 4/9 onwards, that is new.

Went into ED at hospital where they gave me another breathing treatment x 2, magnesium sulfate, IV solu medrol. They were going to admit me but I decided against it with all the covid patients.

I felt pain in my temple and I also felt like my ears were clogged.  My tonugue was tingling and I had pain across my chest.   I had trouble swallowing and taking a deep breath.  The medical providers assessed me and since my heart was not racing and I did not have a rash all over my body, deemed I was okay.  When I went home, I noticed a rash on my chest from my collarbone to my sternum and alongside my ears on my neck.  My sister is an ER Doctor and I did a video conference with her. She had me take Benadryl.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccine nor have I ever had to take Benadryl.

She continued to have a headache for about 5 days and severe fatigue. Adverse event resulted in life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

I could breathe fine, but it felt as if it was swelling and it felt weird to swallow. I didn&#39;t want to overreact so I waited a total of 30 minutes and symptoms subsided. My throat still felt weird, but I could breathe so I felt it was fine to leave. Symptoms subsided more once I got home 30 minutes later, but I took Benadryl. Symptoms eased completely and did not return.

This progressed and got very light headed and weak for about 2 minutes. Throat tightness continued for about 1 hour but did not cause trouble breathing.  At one point felt like I was unable to swallow.  Monitored by coworkers when arrived at work and chose not to go to ED unless symptoms worsened which they did not.

Lasted 48 hours. I know many of these effects are considered a normal reaction to the vaccine. However, the  throat swelling and feeling like I could not breathe was concerning. It happened about 30 minutes after the chills/shaking started and right before I actually began to feel sick.

She woke up and her throat had still some swelling. She called her doctor and she was recommended to take more allergy meds throught out the day and to report event to facility and to monitor.

Second dose: Headache almost immediately after being given the vaccine. Followed by arm pain/ache in BOTH arms, fatigue, lung pain, hip pain, general feeling of being unwell or having the flu. Went to work the next day. Still not feeling well. Felt even worse as the day progressed (with symptoms listed), went home early. Slept for twelve hours. Same symptoms the next day. Oddly, my symptoms seemed to relax a little after I ate lunch. Then returned a few hours later.  Tomorrow will be 7 days after dose. I still have arm pain in both arms and extreme fatigue.

                                                Had vaccination shot #2 in right deltoid. Went to the observation area for the 15 minute period. After approximately 7 minutes, I felt my throat &#34;swelling.&#34; I got up and went to the RN who administered shot. They called the RN over. Vital signs were stable, airway intact, able to speak full sentences. No shortness of breath. It took more effort to swallow. Right arm sore. They monitored me for another 15 minutes. No worsening symptoms. Swelling not improving. Recommended going to the ER (I&#39;m an RN and this was administered at my hospital).  Was escorted to ER. Hooked up to monitor. Slight redness noticed on both arms. No hives. IV started. Given IV Benadryl, famotidine, solu-medrol. No improvement. Hooked up to a monitor and given epi sub-Q. Monitored for approximately 60 minutes with improvement of throat swelling. Discharged to home with prescription for prednisone, famotidine and Benadryl x 5 days.  At home, approximately 8 hours after shot, work up feeling itchy, took Benadryl PO with relief of symptoms approximately 45 minutes later.  Followed up with MD on 1/21. No change in medications.  Asymptomatic during the course of medications. Finished course of medications on the morning of 1/23. Later that evening started feeling tired, had chills, swollen glands. Went to bed early. On 1/24 symptoms continued including lack of appetite, increased fatigue, brain fog. Symptoms continued until 1/25 and gradually improved over the week.

A 52-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN 620H) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took polio vaccine for immunization and experienced allergy, nickel and experienced allergy, chloroxylenol and experienced allergy, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) and experienced allergy, clarithromycin (CLARITIN) and experienced swelling face. The patient stated that, &#34;After the vaccine was administered (18Mar2021 12:00) my throat felt like a mild cold making it a little more difficult to swallow. As I was sent to the high risk area I was monitored by a nurse. Upon leaving I got into my car that was warm inside. As I was driving I felt my throat closing up, making it more and more difficult to swallow or breathe. I went to a (store) and spoke to the pharmacist there. She advised me to take Benadryl immediately. She noticed hives on my neck and a swollen face and neck. As Benadryl took effect the hives receaded and the swelling of my face and neck went down. I went back to the vaccination site and seemed medical attention from the (Department name) Department team. They checked my vital signs and released me after a waiting period without any further medication being administered. I was given an appointment for 08Apr2021. I am concerned about an adverse reaction at the second appointment. Is it better to wait a little longer for the second dose to be given?&#34; Patient is not pregnant.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Benadryl. Outcome of the events was resolving.

Slept 2 days, woke up  little wheezing, BAD headache....lasted 3days . Next day I had bad muscle pain, some bone pain, arm sore that wasn?t bothersome. EXTREME FATIGUE .....couldn?t get off couch  bout 8 days. When I did very dizzy would stagger to the right. Fell into other couch trying to get up bout the 3 day. Fatigue was getting worse, hard to move body, VERY SLEEPY . Family insisted I go to ER or they would call EMS. I only will go if on death bed. This was 1st time in life I waited 8 days to shower, I?m a very clean person, I will even do my makeup almost daily. My biggest concern is the MALAISE AND FATIGUE WAS WORSENING AS DAYS WENT ON.   I DO HAve Hx. Of reactions to tetanus but nothing like this. I?m waiting to go to dr to have labs drawn because of this. Thanks you

                                                Night of vaccine felt heaviness on chest - using elliptical machine as usual and felt out of breath very quickly within 15 minutes.  Normally do 30 minutes and can speak through it.  Just thought I was tired. Overnight joint pain significant in knees, fingers and shoulder blades.  Husband told me I was moaning throughout the night and turning from side to side.  Got up to go to the bathroom once and head felt foggy. Morning got up as usual  and quickly became light headed.  Started to black out to the point where sitting down and putting my head down didn?t help.  Was blacked out and yelled for my husband.  Husband carried me to the couch what I was saying he thought I was hallucinating.  Began to have whole body trembling - not necessarily chills just trembling.  After about an hour subsided.  Blacking out lasted on and off throughout the day.  O2 stats between 91 and 94 throughout the day, fast heart rate 90&#43;.  No fever.  Stayed in bed all day, barely moved.  Restless and couldn?t get comfortable - very bad headache.  Going in and out of sleep.   Treated with Tylenol arthritis and ibuprofen.  Drank water and some hot tea.  Very hard to even drink anything. Next day felt like I had been sick although by 5pm seemed to be back to baseline.

A 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Mar2021 at 10:15 (at the age of 52-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy since Oct2015 (officially diagnosed in Oct2015, but the doctors believed it was in her early 20s but she was misdiagnosed for decades), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from 2020 (diagnosed a year ago), sleep apnea since 2016 (patient thought she was diagnosed in 2016), COVID-19 in Nov2020 from which the patient almost died, memory loss (left over COVID symptom) for which the patient was in speech therapy, intermittent body pain (aftereffects of COVID-19), relapse in seizures due to COVID-19, her eyesight was terrible, epilepsy migraines. Concomitant medications included unspecified epilepsy medications. There was no other vaccine given on the same day, or 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received a flu shot and fainted, on an unspecified date. On 08Mar2021 at 11:15, the patient experienced sore arm (pain 2/10). On 08Mar2021 at 22:00, the patient had headache which got progressively worse, then it got so bad she wanted to pop her head off at midnight. On 09Mar2021 at 00:00, the patient had shaking and shivering where it looked like she was convulsing (she had history of epilepsy and knew what a seizure felt like, her husband may have thought she was having a seizure). The patient had chills to the point where she had multiple blankets and could not stop shaking, took her pulse ox and it dropped down to 93. The caller&#39;s baseline temperature was 97.1 and her daughter took her temperature and it was 98.9, most people wouldn&#39;t consider that a temperature, but it was a temperature for her. The caller kept shaking like that for hours. On 09Mar2021 between 21:00-23:00, the patient had chills again. On 09Mar2021, the patient experienced excruciating body pain (pain 9/10) in very specific parts of her body. On 09Mar2021 by 12:00, the caller&#39;s spinal column hurt the worst, the front of her calves and hip joints, the very edges of her back, the spine from the top of her neck to her butt and then next to it was not so bad but the side of her back was excruciating, the butt muscles hurt really bad, the front of her thighs, left arm, 3 left fingers, but not the other 2 fingers. Oddly enough, she was considered a long hauler, it was the places that her occupational therapist and physical therapists were working on. On 09Mar2021 at 00:00, the patient experienced dizziness (that was on and off all day until bedtime last night on 09Mar2021) and vomiting (she couldn&#39;t hold down water). On 09Mar2021, the patient was not feeling well enough. On 10Mar2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced diarrhea (she&#39;s only gone to the bathroom twice). On Mar2021, the patient experienced exhaustion and no appetite at all. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced a high level of shortness of breath (patient was unsure if this was due to COVID-19). The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures which included an echocardiogram on an unspecified date: her left atrium was enlarged and her cardiac numbers were high, they were going to monitor her heart and the doctors didn&#39;t know if it was because she had COVID-19 or if it was that the doctors got lucky and found it, they had nothing to compare it to because she only had this one echocardiogram. The patient had history of epilepsy migraines (can pinpoint the spot where it hurts), she thought she would try sumatriptan succinate (IMITREX) for this headache (her whole head hurt), as it didn&#39;t interact with her other medications. The patient also took acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (TYLENOL PM; Lot: GF6062, Expiry: Jun2022), ibuprofen (patient thinks the Lot is QWE2546A, but is unsure) for the headache. The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) which she had from a previous prescription and that made the vomiting stop. The events did not require an emergency room or physician office visit. The patient did not think that the reactions were due to her epilepsy medication. The clinical outcome of excruciating body pain was resolved on 09Mar2021 (it&#39;s hard for the caller to say if she has recovered because she had COVID-19 aftereffects and had body pains that come back intermittently), sore arm / front of her calves, front of her thighs, left arm, 3 left fingers, shaking, shivering/chills, pulse ox and it dropped down to 93, spinal column hurt the worst (the spine from the top of her neck to her butt), butt muscles hurt really bad, caller&#39;s spinal column hurt the worst, the front of her calves and hip joints, spinal column hurt the worst, the very edges of her back, the side of her back was excruciating, dizziness, vomiting, not feeling well enough,  no appetite at all was resolved on 09Mar2021; headache was not resolved (unless the caller was asleep, she felt the headache); exhaustion was not resolved; diarrhea and high level of shortness of breath was unknown.

At 5pm, I had a headache, my neck was hurting and I began feeling so weak I could barely talk, I couldn&#39;t hold my eyes open. I took 3 Aleve. At 8pm, I started with shortness of breath just going downstairs plus my entire body felt like I was hit by a truck. My 3lb. Chihuahua would get on me and it felt like I was hit by a bat with a ripple effect into the surrounding area. I took 2 Tylenol PMs. On 04/07, at 6am, I woke up to my limbs extremely swollen and throbbing, this included both feet and especially both wrists and hands. My hands were worse than my feet. My left wrist/hand also had tingling. I was so weak I could barely get out of bed or talk, this continued through to 5:30pm same day. I called an Urgent Clinic and told her all my symptoms, she said were all &#34;normal&#34; until I got to my wrists/hands and limbs. Urgent Care told me it would be best to be seen in ER and evaluated. I immediately went to ER . This approximate time was 6:30pm on 04/07/21.

A 52-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the age 52-year-old on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hemodialysis for many years, adherent to medical care, multiple DVTs and Pes (On anticoagulants), morbid obesity, Patient was on dialysis for renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant (positive), Afib, allergic to shellfish. Family history included renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant. Concomitant medications included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN); metoprolol; amitriptyline; calcitriol; ergocalciferol (VIT D); calcium; calcium acetate (PHOSLO); amiodarone; albuterol. The patient previously allergic to Cipro, clindamycin, doxycyclin, Lyrica, tetracycline. The patient previously was non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient hasn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient wasn&#39;t smoker/ former smoker. There was no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. A nephrologist who reported patient in her hemodialysis unit who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 but were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. More detail is below on each patient. The patient COVID results were sent to the local health department for genetic sequencing (pending) and SARS titers were drawn (pending). Unfortunately, the HD unit does not have B/L information (although the B/L # was put on the patient&#39;s COVID vaccine cards, a record was not kept in the HD unit). Day she came in for dialysis she was already short of breath she said she&#39;d had body aches for 5 days, got short of breath on 05Apr2021. The day before, started getting cough, nauseous, chills, abdominal discomfort on 04Apr2021. The patient was sent to the ER from dialysis and was admitted for SOB on 05Apr2021 and passed away on 09Apr2021 due to a GI bleed. Patient is over 500lbs so was unable to fit into hospital imaging equiment for CT scans or weight measurements. COVID-19 test was positive on 05Apr2021; the patient experienced COVID pneumonia on 05Apr2021. The patient admitted on 05Apr2021 to regular floor. The patient was moved to an Intensive Care Unit on 06Apr2021. The patient experienced short of breath on 05Apr2021 and required much more O2 than normal. Sometimes required BP support while on Dialysis and BP was 113/61 in ER. Pressure dropped to 100/70 and required mitrodrine after fluid was removed. The patient needed 4 liters supplemental O2 vs. only needing 2 liters at home. The patient experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia and no Respiratory failure. Respiration was 22. After 5 litres of O2 improved. Pulse 93 in ER. Cardiovascular: There was no heart failure, cardiogenic shock, Acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and myocarditis. The patient Had chest pain which resolved when O2 was administered. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic: There was no Vomiting, Diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea and complained of abdominal pain. There was no Jaundice and acute liver failure. Neurological: There was no altered consciousness, altered consciousness, encephalopathy, meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. The patient had headaches a couple days before admitting to ER. Hematological: There was no Thrombocytopenia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. INR was 3 due to large dose of coumadin, and platelets were 180 and white count 6.8. Slight troponin increased at 0.37 at admittance, BNP 39. The patient started coughing up blood, having hemoxysis and bleeding on unspecified date. Laboratory test or diagnostic studies was reported that test for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or other commercial or public health assay. Xray showed vascular congestion with superimposed infiltrate which could represent pneumonia. Blood count was 11 and 36.7% at ER. Clinical chemistry: Sodium was 133; BUN was 68; Creatinine was 10. Evidence of hypoxemia: Pulse oO2 was 90 in ER.  CT scans: unknown results. Urinalysis: On dialysis so does not make urine. The patient had received Remdesivir, from 06Apr2021, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Azithromycin from 06Apr2021 and Corticosteroids from 06Apr2021 for COVID-19.  The outcome of event &#34;GI bleed&#34; was fatal, the event &#34;chest pain&#34; and &#34;body aches&#34; was recovered and other events was unknown. The patient died on 09Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect drug cannot be excluded for the events vaccination failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis. However, the patient&#39;s multiple medical comborbidities including renal failure requiring dialysis, lupus, and morbid obesity along with the risk of COVID-19 infection in light of the current pandemic are the more likely explanations for the development of these infections. The events gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage, hemolysis and troponin increased are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, and are considered unrelated to the suspect drug. The patient is currently on warfarin which may increase the risk for bleeds. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: GI bleed

A 53-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EU9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 08:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypothyroidism and chronic low back pain.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), baclofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and etodolac (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took miconazole nitrate (MONISTAT) on unknown dates for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy. On 31Dec2020 at 10:00, the patient started with a red raised rash under her arms and waistline and as the day progressed the rash turned hot to touch with raised red large hives all over her body including her face/head. By 23:00 on 31Dec2020, the patient had already taken 3 doses of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) which was not effective. Then, later on 31Dec2020, shortness of breath started with numbness in the hands/feet/chest area. Her daughter took her to the emergency room. She was started on intravenous diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and famotidine (PEPCID). The medications took time to work but they did resolve her shortness of breath and the hives subsided to mild redness.  She was sent home and given the following medications to take: diphenhydramine 50 mg every 4 hours, methylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSE PAK), cetirizine (ZYRTEC) daily, and famotidine (PEPCID) daily. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the red rash, rash was hot to touch, shortness of breath, and numbness, were reported as recovered with lasting effects; while that of the hives was recovering as they still flared up if she did not take the medications every 4 hours. The reporter assessed all the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported shortness of breath together with red rash was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE together with rash was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course.

                                                Four days ago the patient received her 2nd coronavirus vaccine. She received at the hospital pot. She received her 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She tolerated her 1st vaccine dose without incident. She did not have any problems approximately 15 minutes after her 2nd dose and she was then released to drive away. About 30 minutes after her 2nd dose she developed nonspecific symptoms of shortness of breath and a sensation of something sticking in her throat. She presented to the emergency department. She did not receive epinephrine. She was monitored and received intravenous fluids and diphenhydramine. She notes ongoing itching with rash and which she describes as exacerbation of asthma. She has known asthma with frequent exacerbations. She has been hospitalized numerous times in the past for asthma exacerbation. Now that it has been several days since her vaccination and she is still having rash and difficulty with her asthma we have discussed initiation of low-dose steroids for ongoing improvement.

A 53-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 17:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (HTN) and asthma, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included first dose of PFIZER BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE on 28Dec2020 at 01:15 PM (lot number: EL1284) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization given when the patient was 53 years old. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks prior to covid vaccine. She had known allergies which were not specified. She was not pregnant. The patient experienced chest tightness, wheezing, throat swelling, tongue tingling and lip numbness, all on 18Jan2021 at 05:45 PM with outcome of recovering. The events resulted to Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for all events included DECADRON and Benadryl script for Epipen. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. She was tested for covid post vaccination through nasal swab on 20Jan2021 with pending result.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of chest tightness, wheezing, throat swelling, tongue tingling and lip numbness  due to temporal relationship.  However,  the chest tightness, wheezing may possibly be associated with the patient&#39;s history of asthma. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

No other symptoms or problems other that soreness at injection site the next morning.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving the injection, I experienced the following symptoms simultaneously: skin flushed/got hot, hands got numb and tingly, back of and sides of my tongue got thick- felt like it was swelling, got more difficult to breathe, heartbeat started racing, felt light-headed. I sat up in the edge of my seat and almost called for help, however the symptoms subsided within 2-3 minutes and then I was fine. Had a lingering, very minor headache and no other symptoms. I didn&#39;t tell anybody and came home and took 1 benadryl just to be safe.

                                                Woke on 4th day after first vaccine with nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, lethargy, dizziness, weakness. In the evening, hands, wrists, feet, and ankles began itching and showing large, red welts; took Benadryl. Woke on 5th day, itching and red welts began spreading all over body, including head and ears. Continued taking zyrtec, benadryl, and cortisone, which helped somewhat.  On 6th day, these medications were not controlling the itching and welts/hives. By evening, all was worsening and throat was swollen. Went to ER on night of 3/18/21, where I received IV treatment to stop the reaction. ER also prescribed 4 days of prednisone and recommended that I not take the second Covid-19 vaccine.

A 53-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 19Apr2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history bipolar disorder, breast cancer, and slightly high blood pressure. Patient had a right mastectomy and had lymph nodes removed from the right side. In the spring, when everyone was mowing grass and it was real humid outside, she got welts on her body. It was temporary and went away. Patient would get really itchy. Concomitant medications included letrozole for breast cancer (the tumor in her breast was powered by hormones. This drug suppressed hormones) from 2017 and ongoing, omeprazole for constant heartburn from an unspecified date and ongoing, propranolol hydrochloride (PROPANOLOL) for anxiety from 2016 and ongoing, clonazepam for anxiety from 2016 and ongoing, and venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) for bipolar disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid on 29Mar2021 11:30 for COVID-19 immunisation and was really tired after the first vaccine. When she was a kid, her doctor put her on steroids. Never happened after age 12. Patient also got the influenza vaccine (flu shot) a couple of years before. The patient experienced redness in right arm at mastectomy site, and warm to touch, welts, red bumps, itching, and nauseated on 20Apr2021. Patient had a right mastectomy and had lymph nodes removed from the right side. In the area where that occurred, it had become red, inflamed, and a little welty. Not all of the welts were raised, they look like they were in the skin. There was redness and it was like someone scratched her and was kind of itchy. She took 2 diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Patient was very sensitive to allergies, but was not allergic to anything. Sometimes she broke out in welts in the spring. Patient got the injection in the left side but the reaction was occurring in the right side. Patient was pretty tired, but she was concerned about the rash. Patient was concerned that the right arm was roughly 2&#34; bigger than the left arm around it. Patient had been measuring the circumference, because nurses were paranoid about things like that. It was usually not 2&#34; more around. Patient woke up this around 10:00 am. Around roughly 12:20 pm, or probably 10 after 12, she looked in the mirror and said there it was. She noticed the itching and thought it was dry skin. That area was prone to dry skin. The welty points of redness that were raised. It looked like someone had scratched across the area. It was red, and might be the end of one red scratchy area might be a bump. It looked like, if were to put hand where the nipple used to be and open up the area. That would all be covered. It included the upper arm and the inside of the shoulder, like the front side of the shoulder. It was raised and welty redness. Not all areas were raised and was bumpy. It was all pretty red and warm to the touch. The itchiness started more after she saw it, which was terrible. Patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride because she was concerned about an allergic reaction. She also had scheduled medications that she took in the morning. Patient took 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride this morning. Patient took at 12:10 pm when noticed these things. At first, she didn&#39;t think anything, she didn&#39;t think like it was the Pfizer shot or anything. It was just a normal day. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride had done nothing for the welts yet. Patient then felt kind of nauseated. It started when we first got on the phone. She couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. Patient went to the emergency room last Monday. The incident had nothing to do with any vaccine. She had chest pain and shortness of breath. They drew all of the labs. If she wanted to know if anything in the labs was different from then and now, she could. Everything was normal. She got an inhaler. They though it might be related to all of her allergies. The only way she would go see a doctor, is if she saw that the arm was getting much bigger, like it grew 2&#34; more. If she had a hard time breathing, she would call 911. Patient had rash around right arm on 20Apr2021, in area of past breast mastectomy. Patient first noticed itching and the redness around 12:20 pm on 20Apr2021. Had gotten progressively worse. Patient did not see in the emergency department and was not hospitalized. Patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Multiorgan were involved. Patient just noticed new area that formed. There were lines coming out of the area and came below the sleeve line. The red rash was spreading. It looked like something invisible scratched it. There was a triangle of three dots with a little scratch mark below the sleeve. There was another dot area on the forearm that itches, just like the other stuff did. Stomach had been feeling a little jumpy. Patient had already eaten breakfast. It was not horrible. Patient would watch it and drink ginger ale. Patient was asking what parameters should be for calling 911. She was home alone. This was not life threatening but if it turned into something bigger or if she noticed getting a bigger rash, she might have to call 911. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Immediately afterward, she developed full-body shaking and SOB.  She was immediately sent to the ER where she was found to have stridor but without angioedema, hypoxia, urticaria, vomiting, hypotension, or other signs of anaphylaxis.  During her stay in the ER, I oversaw her care and her symptoms completely resolved after IM Epi, benadryl, famotidine, albuterol/iptratropium, steroids, and magnesium.  After an observation period in the ED, she had no recurrence of symptoms and was ultimately discharged.

                                                On 1/28/2021, I woke from my sleep with legs cramps and muscle pain.  I went to the toliet to urinate and began to have multiple bowel movement.  I began to feel nauseated and very cold with shortness of breath and my heart racing.  I cleaned up, washed my hands and proceeded to check my temperature it read 91.5, I continue to check it and it continue to read 91.5.  I drank water and orange juice thinking it was my blood sugar.  I began to feel dizzy but did not want to lay flat on my bed due to the shortness of breath.  My heart rate was 120.  I checked my blood pressure it was 180/120.  I was fearful of shock.  I continued to pace and warm up with blankets and a space heater.  I took a warm bath and my temperature increased to 97.7.  I continued to feel my pulse racing.  I called Dr. office and got an appointment to see her 8:30 am 1/29/2021.  She checked my vitals signs B/P  - 143/87, P 80, T 98.1 O2Sat 99, heart and lungs.  She did labs and urinalysis.  She prescribed Clonidine 0.1mg TID take if BP greater 160/90 and Allergra 180 mg QD prn for itch and reaction.  I will return to see her 2/5/2021.

                                                I received the shot Wed. afternoon. I had a sore arm right away, but that was all. Then Thur. I ate food that I normally eat (the doctor asked what foods I had) and went to bed. Fri 3am I work up and couldn&#39;t breath. I already have sinus issues, and it felt as if I was choking. I gargled, then looked at my throat in the mirror. My Uvula  was swollen 3 times it&#39;s nomal size. I calle a family member to take me to the ER. I was diagnosed ith Uvulitis. givendiphenhydramine, dexamethasone, famotidine, and neck xray, and strep tests (which were negative) The doctor said it definitely was an allergic reaction. He asked me about foods (I hadn&#39;t eaten anything unusual) but couldn&#39;t conclusively say it was because of the vaccine.. None of the treatments worked, but they still released me, saying that it would eventually stop being swollen, and if it was still an issue in a week that I should contact my primary . Although my swelling came down after a day, my throat is still red and irritated as of Saturday.

The Doctor in place informed that it was a normal reaction.   Everything was going well until I went to sleep. I woke up in panic due to not being able to breath. I felt like my brain, face, eyes, and nose were swelling. My chest was compressed. Then I remembered I didn&#39;t take any medication; therefore, I took two Advil. After and hour, I noticed that by sitting or walking , I began to feel better.  I went back to sleep in a seated position around 4:30.  Not sure if I want to take the 2nd dose. I&#39;m frighten. Have an appointment with my Doctor on March 22nd.

                                                About 10 minutes (moments before they told me sage to leave) I began thinking I was having a hard time breathing but associated it to anxiousness about receiving the vaccine. Ran my errands in town and kept thinking I was having problems breathing. Again, thought I was imagining. For just a minute or so it felt like my throat was tight, but soon vanished so again thought I was imagining. Just didn?t feel ?right? rest of day but assumed I was dreaming it up. That evening when I laid down to go to sleep, I quickly realized I was having shortness of breath. Could barely breath. I checked my oxygen level &amp; it was running 91-94. However, my heart rate (usually sits between 55-65 when resting) was running in high 70?s to mid-80?s. Called ER and asked if I could take Benadryl- they said yes. Took one adult Benadryl and felt a bit better soon after. An hour later took another along with a Pepcid. Eased up enough then I could go to sleep. Didn?t take any more meds, but it was another day &amp; 1/2 before I felt ?normal? (I have CHF so I deal with some sob always).

A 54-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 07Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included history of three spinal surgeries (takes no pain meds, she is not on pain meds, she has never been on or kept taking them); and has &#34;neuropathy and nerve related issues&#34; that were not this bad since ten years ago in 2011, clarified that what she has is not actually neuropathy, something with the peripheral nerve, she says she doesn&#39;t remember actual verbiage), since ten years ago in 2011, and the only difference was this vaccination, it was not this bad until this vaccination. She doesn&#39;t react well to pharmaceuticals anyway (unspecified). Her medications are that she takes the minimum amount of medications, very minimal (unspecified). There were no concomitant medications. There was no other products. Also, she has not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. For past drug, she didn&#39;t take anything other than 5mg of zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) to sleep at night because of her spine. Patient previously also took pregabalin (LYRICA) and was off it, was also on gabapentin or neurontin (patient did not have those medications to provide NDC/LOT/EXP for either of them because she took them back to the pharmacy or turned them in to the police station because she doesn&#39;t keep medications in her house if she isn&#39;t taking them, and she couldn&#39;t take that medication). Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 54-year-old; Lot Number: EN5318) in Arm Right for covid-19 immunization, and for her first dose the only thing was a sore arm, it was very sore, and she only experienced a slight bit of fatigue after her first dose. She received both doses of vaccine. Her first dose was LOT: EN5318 and was given 14Jan2021, and her second dose was LOT: EN6204 given 07Mar2021. The patient was reporting for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, for she was having a horrible reaction to it &#34;45 days&#34; (as reported) after taking 2nd dose, and had been in the ER, and her temperature still hasn&#39;t gone back down to her normal, her oral temp is still raised and her rectal is raised even more. She was not feeling well, she felt very bad, she would never get a vaccine again, that is how bad it was. Since &#34;45 days&#34; later she was still having significant pain and trouble flexing her right hand open and closed. For events treatment, she took over the counter Tylenol for fever and pain, strength unknown. Patient said she had not had this kind of disabling symptoms or anything before this vaccination. She had a slight fever almost the whole &#34;45 days&#34;. On 08Mar2021, her oral temp was over 98 degrees Fahrenheit when her norm temp being 97.2 or 97.3degrees Fahrenheit. Her rectal temp stayed at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The next day, actually on the 09Mar2021 (which was two days after her second dose), she had the slight fever, fatigue, and extreme pain through her right side. She said her right side means her shoulders, neck, torso, arm, and entire leg. She also had shortness of breath, and severe nerve pain. She called her primary care provider who said to wait 5 days to be seen. On day 5, or actually the whole five days (reported as in Mar2021), she was in bed and didn&#39;t leave her apartment because she was in bed and she was vomiting. On day 2 or within 6 hours of vaccination, she had a feeling of urination, like she had to urinate when she didn&#39;t, that feeling of urination was equivalent of having contrast dye (NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown) put in her IV which makes her feel like she is peeing her pants but she did not, and that feeling has not gone away. On day 5 (11Mar2021), she was dizzy and fell. In Mar2021, she was disorientated and vomiting, she couldn&#39;t eat anything other than soup. On day two (Mar2021) she had some kind of eye pain that is still there &#34;45 days later&#34;, it feels like pins and needles. Her skin was burning and painful to the touch, she couldn&#39;t keep an IV in her when she was in the ER. She was not admitted to the hospital. She was having headaches, and joint and muscle pain. She had nausea and vomiting at different times. She continued to have shortness of breath. She had a horrible lack of appetite. She had sores in her mouth and nose. She had anal hemorrhoid sores. Last night (05Apr2021 )she had a headache that was severe like someone put a knife behind her right eye, and when she got up (06Apr2021) her eye felt heavy and her eye was drooping. She also had difficulty speaking, with her words. She says she had passed out, and had been dropping things, she had broken glass. She has been to a neurologist and a gastroenterologist. She clarified that all of these events were after her second dose, for her first dose the only thing was a sore arm, it was very sore, and she only experienced a slight bit of fatigue after her first dose. None of her doctors know what to do, her gastro doctor was giving her an anti inflammatory suppository and was going to do some tests. She had blood done from neurologist and at the ER and no one knows what to do, they keep referring her to other doctors. She wished someone could explain to her, but no one know and they said it was uncharted territory, they didn&#39;t know what to do. She is now back on Lyrica which she was off of but the ER prescribed her 300mg three times a day. She wanted to know what the hell is going on with this vaccine, and that she doesn&#39;t think having these side effects &#34;45 days&#34; out is normal. She wanted to be transferred to speak with someone about what to do because her doctor&#39;s don&#39;t know anything. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her husband. This is the first of two reports.  A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 54 years of age), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right on 10Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe asthma which started as a child and then it went away and then as an adult it got severe around 2010 and ongoing, she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She had ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), brain surgery in 2007, low immune system, allergies to cephalosporins, pulmonary and stomach issues; and bradycardia (as her BP usually runs 90/45 and she is bradycardic). Concomitant medications included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR HFA), salbutamol (VENTOLIN [SALBUTAMOL]), and montelukast (MONTELUKAST), all taken for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN], omeprazole, phenytoin sodium, azelastine, ipratropium bromide, fluticasone propionate (FLONASE [FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE]), and ipratropium bromide, salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; prednisone taken for an unspecified indication from 2021 and ongoing as she was on this steroid 2 weeks before the vaccine; and  azithromycin which she takes prophylactically for her low immune system from an unspecified start date and ongoing. She was on a lot of medications period and most are for her pulmonary and stomach issues. The patient previously took propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, and Percocet wherein the patient had drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic shock with these; adhesive from nicotine patch made her arm to get red and swollen (Dermatitis contact). She previously took EpiPen for anaphylaxis. It was reported that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She got her vaccine at a hospital in their clinic and she was transferred from the vaccine clinic to the ER. Stated she was given a shot with an Epi-pen in her thigh at the clinic and transferred to the ER. In the ER, she was given Benadryl and watched for 4 hours. She would state this was medically significant because of airway, breathing, circulation and she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She added that it was kind of weird and freaky. She mentioned that along with that, shortly before she was released from the ER, she experienced a very sore arm where she was given the injection. She heard that was very common so she dealt with it. However as the night progressed, it got increasingly worse, it almost felt like she was punched several times in her arm. It probably started between hour 3 and 4 after receiving the vaccine. She added that she had a very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.  It was not serious, just annoying and it was gone 3 days later. She had injection site bruising on 10Mar2021. She stated that she knows this because she was a nurse, but a lot of times, people experienced this reaction when they are given Dilaudid wherein they  get a warm feeling in their chest, so they push it really slow and dilute it with saline so it doesn&#39;t have the respiratory factor. She stated that this was kind of what the feeling was like for her and it was scary because she didn&#39;t expect it. She stated that the ER team that assessed her said, because she wasn&#39;t used to that feeling, she may have had a panic attack and that may have made it worse. After she was treated, she spoke with her husband and he had the shot two minutes before her and he had the same feeling but he didn&#39;t freak out and didn&#39;t want to appear weak. Stated he told her he had the same feeling and it lasted 5 minutes and then it went away. Stated since she got scared, it made it worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she had a panic attack that made it worse. She stated that of course her husband didn&#39;t tell her that until she was out of the ER, that it does go away. That made her feel better because she wasn&#39;t the only one that experienced that. States he didn&#39;t say anything about it, because he was worried about her,  he said it was a warm feeling in the chest and not being able to breathe but he didn&#39;t want to say anything because she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She mentioned that they weren&#39;t going to let her get the second dose, so she went to an allergy doctor and told them what happened and about her husband having the same reaction and because she was severely immunocompromised. Stated the hospital said they were not giving her the second dose unless an allergist says it is safe and sets a protocol and he had to write a letter to the hospital. Stated she was pre-medicated 24 hours before the vaccine with 50mg Benadryl, 50mg Benadryl the day of the shot and 50mg of Benadryl two days after the shot. Stated she will have full immunity on 14Apr2021. She added that she had a pulmonary doctor, brain cancer doctor, ENT doctor, stated they don&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine, but they are pretty sure she had a reaction but they can handle it with pre-medicating her. She received the second vaccine on 31Mar2021. She mentioned that she was happy to be able to get her second shot. She stated that at first they didn&#39;t want to give it to her because of her reaction but she kept calling. So she went to a hospital to saw an allergist and he had to sign off that it was safe to give her the second shot and under what circumstances. Stated she had the letter from the hospital that she was seen by them and she needed to be pre-medicated and it had to be given at a hospital that had the ability to intervene quickly and she needed to be watched for at least 30 minutes after the vaccine. She mentioned that to go through what she went though, and not be able to get would have been disappointing. Because of her immune system, it is important to get the shot and there was a way around the reaction which worked for her. She added that even having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, she was able to recover quickly. Stated with having asthma, COPD and a low immune system, she may not recover from Covid. It makes sense they evaluated it and came up with a solution and a pre medication protocol and when and how long and she was still able to get the shot because it is important. Answers to follow up questions indicated that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was given the shot and getting ready to get out of the chair and her husband was about to sit down for his shot. Stated she would say the time of the course of the reaction was within under 5 minutes of her injection. The patient required medical intervention with Epi-Pen, Benadryl, and Duo-Neb. The patient was not hospitalized because she was immunocompromised, it was better to watch herself at home and because she had an Epi Pen at home in case she has that sort of reaction returning over a 72 hour period. Stated they instructed her husband and told them if she felt any different to come back to ER. She was not admitted to the ICU. Organ involvement included: Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress. The event required initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure including Epi-Pen, Benadryl, DuoNeb. Patient have a history of previous allergies: Medication Allergies to Cephalosporins, Anesthesia medications: Propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, Percocet: Anaphylactic shock; Adhesive from nicotine patch, caused her arm to get red and swollen. She takes EpiPen as she had previous history of allergies and since she had multiple medication allergies and had a history of quickly going into anaphylaxis, stated her BP usually runs 90/45 and she was Bradycardic. She did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the events being reported. She did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. She has not received any other vaccines around the time of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient recovered from &#39;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#39;, Difficulty breathing, and &#39;warm feeling in the chest&#39; on 10Mar2021; while having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress were recovered on an unknown date; Vaccination site pain recovered on 13Mar2021 and Injection site bruising recovered on 18Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events except Vaccination site pain and Injection site bruising. Relatedness of drug to reactions/events: Reaction assessed for events &#34;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#34;, &#39;very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.&#39; and Injection site bruising: Method of assessment: Global Introspection: Drug result: Related.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the Company considered all serious and non-serious events as possibly associated to BNT162B2 injection, due to a plausible chronological sequence. Current patient conditions of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allergic diathesis may have been considered as favoring factors in development of reported events.

                                                I went back to the hospital and couple days later they told me that actually I have Deep vein thrombosis now in my legs; my Crohn&#39;s had caused really bad flare up/I have been in the hospital for 5 days now with the clot and Crohn&#39;s Flare; I also have superficial clot in that left leg that was the pain began on the edges/blood clot; the arm is much better now. You know that&#39;s not really sore; I just was too tired/extreme fatigue; really bad like pain; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient).

But then she ended up into ER after the second dose and discovered that her Crohn&#39;s had caused really bad flare up. She mentioned her foot was looking strange but she was just too tired and left the ER. She then went back to the hospital and couple days later they told her that she actually had deep vein thrombosis now in her legs. She also had superficial clot in that left leg where the pain began on the edges. The patient reported that the vaccine was basically started the Crohn&#39;s flare up.

A non-pregnant 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), intramuscular, administered on left arm on 08Apr2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as unknown, single (at the age of 54-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included undifferentiated connective tissue disorder and allergy to dust and pollen.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated on 08Apr2021 12:00, &#34;burning of the tongue from the tip then to the middle and towards the throat. Tonsil kind of closes so that I could not breath well for a few seconds. They put me on oxygen, gave me Benadryl and Tacid&#34;. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not been tested for COVID-19.  The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   No follow up attempts are possible; information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported tonsillar disorder with symptom of dyspnea was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 26Apr2021 at 08:45 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), asthma from 5 years old, calcification of the breast, vitamin D deficiency, &#34;keep immune system up&#34;, ongoing panic and anxiety disorder. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid/calcium carbonate/calcium pantothenate/calcium phosphate/chromium/cyanocobalamin/folic acid/magnesium carbonate/ magnesium hydroxide/manganese gluconate/nicotinic acid/potassium bicarbonate/potassium carbonate/potassium phosphate dibasic/pyridoxine hydrochloride/quercetin/riboflavin sodium phosphate/sodium bicarbonate/sodium phosphate/thiamine hydrochloride/thioctic acid/zinc ascorbate (EMERGEN-C) to keep immune system up and colecalciferol (D3) for vitamin D deficiency. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 26Apr2021, right after the vaccination, the patient felt a little dizzy but proceeded to her car anyway, got about half a mile away and felt extreme panic. On 26Apr2021 at 09:35, the patient had a major panic attack (which the patient gets, &#34;but it had to be something really big&#34;). She began hyperventilating on 26Apr2021, felt like she was going to faint. She pulled over and started breathing in her hands until she felt almost normal; the anxiety didn&#39;t go away, but that was normal for her. Then the faintness came back, and she pulled over again; mentioned she was in heavy traffic and hurried up to pull over. Eventually she contacted her son and he came and took over the wheel. This happened three times on her 45-minute drive; at 15 minutes, then 10 minutes and then at 9 or 8 minutes. She stated she had nothing to eat or drink before the vaccine and they didn&#39;t advise her to get anything to eat or drink and that may have had something to do with it. She could see everything looking greenish and it was a sunny day outside. She had a bottle of water and started to drink, and it subsided for a little bit. She pulled over and sat for 15 minutes; there were trucks and cars going really fast; she was doing self-talk saying you can do this and get home; then she drove about 10 or 15 more minutes; she had stayed on the side so she could pull over; cars honked at her for going so slow and she pulled over again. It happened again after 20 minutes. She was feeling really funny. Her son took her for coffee and something to eat. Throughout the day she was having hyperventilation and anxiety feelings until about 19:30 it went away. She had a good night&#39;s rest. On 27Apr2021 in the evening, the patient experienced chills so she put on socks; and she had a headache (she never had headaches), so she went to bed. Then she woke up at midnight and felt really energetic, so she watched a little TV then went back to sleep. Now it was day three and she had a lot of bursts of energy. This morning, 28Apr2021, she had a burst of energy and felt renewed. The events did not require a visit to the physician office or emergency room. The clinical outcome of feeling faint and seeing green was resolved on 26Apr2021; of dizzy, headache, and chills was resolved on 27Apr2021; of panic attack and hyperventilation was not resolved; of bursts of energy was unknown.

I had already left the drive-thru vaccination clinic and was driving to the hospital emergency room where I work. I informed my colleagues of my symptoms and was treated for anaphylaxis with IV diphenhydramine and famotidine over several hours. I was given a prescription for a prednisone taper for the next 6 days.

                                                Vaccine administered at 11:15 AM.  At 12:00 pm the top of my head became very hot, my face felt hot and red with raised rash, my scalp became very itchy, my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest and I had pounding in both ears.  My bilateral forearms began to itch and then developed hives.  I notified my Supervisor that I was having a reaction.  I was checked in to ER (where I am an RN).  My blood pressure was elevated 180&#39;s systolic and my heart rate was 180BPM and short of breath.  An IV was started and I was given Normal Saline Bolus, Solu-medrol 125MG and Benadryl 25MG IV.  Prior to medications, my throat felt itchy and &#34;tight&#34; but resolved once medication given.  The itching and hives continued to spread to my upper back, neck, bilateral feet and behind my bilateral knees.  After approximately 1 1/2 hrs itching and hives continued then I was given Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25mg PO which after 40 minutes my itching and hives resolved.  I was later discharged home with a prescription of Methylprednisolone 4MG dose pack.  Symptoms resolved until approximately 1:30 am on 5/7/2021 when I awoke to pounding in my ears and the feeling once again my heart was beating out of my chest.  My heart rate was 132BPM, I became hot and diaphoretic,  short of breath.  My scalp felt it was on fire and then I broke out in hives.  I immediately took Prednisone, benadryl and pepcid.  I took a cool shower, got dressed and drove to the hospital down the road and sat in the parking lot just in case my throat became itchy and tight (which it did not).  The hives and itching began to resolve after an hour.  My heart rate went back to 67BPM and shortness of breath resolved as well.  I called Employee Health at hospital and made a report of symptoms.

                                                The day after the vaccination I had redness around my whole shoulder and arm. On the third day I developed swelling of my shoulder and neck with horrible pain when I breathe.   I went to urgent care and had an x-ray which was clear and they were treating me for myalgia with Motrin. I refused any narcotic pain medication or a Toradol shot.  The pain never stopped on the 19th I went to Work Force Safety and reported it and I was examined by the nurse practitioner who saw all the swelling and the pain that I was in. That nurse practitioner told me if it wasn?t better in a few days to go to the emergency room to be examined.  On January 23 , I developed swelling and pain went underneath my armpit it?s a burning pain that?s constant since the third day after my injection. My blood pressure was 153/104 and I was having nausea and not feeling well at all. On January 25 the pain and swelling were still there I went to work for a few hours and I went to the emergency room. They gave me lidocaine patch and Zofran for the nausea my blood pressure was 159/103 and I had an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot there was no blood clot but there was lymphadenopathy under my arm hurt and swelling and inflammation around the shoulder. The chest x-ray showed left pleural effusion / Pneumonia. My oxygen saturation was 93 and they wanted to admit me but I am a single mom with a new diabetic 14-year-old at home so they let me go home with a pulse oximeter and a prescription for doxycycline For 10 days.  They called me the next day from the emergency room to follow up with a pulmonologist and cardiologist. On January 28 I saw the pulmonologist who did an ultrasound in his office and saw the fluid on my left lung. He said that most likely because the technique of the injection was so high in my shoulder that they probably had a nerve and I did have the swelling in the lymphadenopathy and all the pain and it hurt when I breathe so I wasn?t breathing correctly and I was splitting my arm against me and that?s how I probably developed plural effusion and pneumonia. I am following up with him on February 4. I still have shortness of breath and my oxygen saturation is 93. I am also on two inhalers that the pulmonologist ordered.

I was in the waiting area when this occured and the caregivers walked me over to the emergency department and immediately started treatment for my symptoms. I was at he ER about seven hours before I was allowed to go home. I was still having symptoms a couple days later and returned to emergency room.

Tests ran showed no blockage or issue with heart and no blood clot found.  Tests are still being run, but no cholesterol issues, low BP rate always, and no history of heart issues for myself or family members.  2nd dose caused shortness of breathing starting at 24 plus hours and increased heart rate for 7&#43; days and starting to decrease.  Lungs cleared up after 6 days from 2nd dose.

It has now been 1 week and is down to 4 cm. Also, on 2/23 had a flair-up of the post CoVid syndrome and ended up in the ER with chest pain and severe shortness of breath.  All cardiac tests came back within normal limits.  Chest X-ray just showed atelectasis in bases remaining from bilat CoVid pneumonia 3 months ago.  Diagnosis was post CoVid syndrome.  Treatment - nebulizer and anti-inflammatories - more ibuprofen.  Returned to baseline shortness of breath that has existed since having CoVid in November in about 8 hours.  I&#39;m not sure if this was a reaction to the vaccine, but thought I would include it.

                                                Thirty hours in, I had joint aches in my spine (mainly neck and low back); low grade fever; nauseated;  headache. I felt like everything was it  was swollen  and tight - I couldn&#39;t wear my watch on my wrist. Almost like lymph system - nothing tight in my arm pits; felt like my pants were too tight in my groin - my body was swollen by my lymph nodes. Developed all kinds of gas in my stomach.  I was having chest pains - 3 or 4 times a month before the vaccine - after the vaccine - I&#39;m having the chest pains daily. That lasted for about 12 hours. Next day, 22nd, I developed diarrhea for 24 hours.  9 days later - I got numbness and tingling started radiating down my wrist into my fingers; lower calf to my feet and I had to go see my orthopedic surgeon - it was radiating down into my feet. He sent me to a podiatrist and he doesn&#39;t know.  Those symptoms still haven&#39;t resolved. When I wake up - it&#39;s a low level and by night time my feet would get so numb and tingly it drove me crazy and then it went into my hands. Went to my doctor on March 2nd - my doctor thought I was having a histamine response in my body. I took an antihistamine - and half my symptoms went away. My esophagus is going into spasms -  and I am trying to see a GI specialist. I was taking Benadryl last week but I got too tired. So I take 2 Benadryl at night now and I&#39;m taking a Zyrtec (generic) at the day - it takes the edge off but doesn&#39;t resolve the symptoms entirely. Eleven day - I developed a floaty in my right eye - a black spot. I went to my eye doctor - it looks like my eye is healthy -but floaty is not going away. So talking on the phone, My throat is starting to swell up and feels like something back there and the more I talk pretty soon I start losing my voice (happening now on the phone). They added to my meds: Pepsid, Viscus lidocaine;  Mylanta after every meal; Pantoprazole;  Sucralfate; gave me another one but I haven&#39;t taken it yet: Hyoscyamine - for really bad spasms and I haven&#39;t had another really bad one since I went to ER (besides taking the antihistamines).  I have seen 5 specialists all together.

Took tylenol several time through the day and fever resolved approx 7pm on 1/8/21.  Approx 11:00pm that day I woke up dizzy and felt chest heaviness, but went back to sleep.  Woke up again after midnight and sat up in bed and felt like I was falling out of the bed (extremely dizzy) and decided to check my oxygen level due to me having prn shortness of breath since contacting covid in July 2020 and noticed that my heart rate was 186 bpm.  Went to ER and MD was told that I had a covid shot the she wasn&#39;t sure if that what caused the SVT and could not tell me if I should or shouldn&#39;t take injection #2. Injection #2-(1/29/21) 4 hours after taking this injection started with low grade temp, sore arm and achy all over and noticed my heartrate was in the 120&#39;s.  Woke up next morning temp was 103.0.  Took tylenol troughout day and that day.  Heart rate was in the upper 150&#39;s.  I did not go to the ER.  The next day heart rate continues 140-150.

                                                Day of shot developed pain in entire right side(chest area), also acid reflux and nausea. That went away about 12 hours after the vaccine. Ten days after I developed a slight pain in right lateral side that progresses to constant pain in 2 places on right side including under right clavicle. I had pain upon taking in a deep breath. Saw MD after 4 days of these SXS. Performed labs, Chest x-ray and EKG. All were essentially normal except elevated WBC count. Have 2 COVID test which were both normal. Md said possibly some sort of inflammation and suggested taking anti-inflammatories which did not help much at all with SXS. After a few more days the SXS changed to constant chest pain(pressure), SOB upon exertion and pain behind knee. F/U with MD again and it was decided to wait a few more days. Upon suggestion from friend asked MD to perform D-Dimer lab test. The result was 4,400. My normal value should have been 550. Sent to ER. CT of chest, EKG and more labs performed. CT revealed large bilateral pulmonary embolisms in pulmonary arteries. Started on blood thinners. Ultrasound of left leg revealed large DVT. Sent home after 2 days on blood thinners. SXS stopped after a few days.

                                                Within the first few min of getting the injection my throat got tight and my tongue swelled up and got numb. I could still breathe fine. Didn&#39;t need any additional help. Throat cleared up after a few hours. Tongue still numb and swollen a bit for around 4 days after. Each day got better but took a few days for it to return to normal. Still having some occasional numbness on day 5 but not swollen and only on the edge of tongue. At this reporting I seem to have mostly recovered. I had a video conference with my doctor a couple days after to discuss my reaction.

A 55-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in arm left on 19Feb2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201), at the age of 55 years, as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed 3 years ago, ongoing gastrooesophageal reflux disease diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing hypertension diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing food allergy: allergic to eggs, shellfish, dairy/lactose intolerant, ongoing allergies to environmental: standard- hay fever, dust, mold, ongoing allergies to dogs and cats, contrast media reaction (IV contrast CT scan dye- respiratory distress, throat tightens), urticaria, pruritus. She had Covid on 18Dec2020 and &#34;Covid rash it attached her muscular system. She had muscular pain in the wrist and hip on the right side and mild double vision.&#34; The patient previously took vitamin k 2 and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Toradol and experienced urticaria, influenza vaccine and experienced rash at the injection site, at the age of 34 years (because she&#39;s allergic to eggs). The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 on 29Jan2021 Lot: EL3247; 9:30 AM; Right arm for covid-19 immunisation and she did not have any symptoms whatsoever with the first shot. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. Concomitant medications included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease; lisinopril taken for hypertension; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma; salbutamol sulfate (INHALERIN) taken for asthma; start and stop date were not reported for all.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis on 26Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, throat starting to close/throat started tightening on 19Feb2021 with outcome of recovered, severe rash- latus stranding, purple dots, and hives from face all the way down to toes on 19Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, double vision on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right eye is going cross eyed/left eye is dropping on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right wrist pain increased dramatically after the vaccine on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown for Hand swelling and recovered for Localised itching. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events: Benadryl, Zyrtec, Pepcid, New glasses for double vision, Prednisone 7 day ween. The patient underwent lab tests which included Hematology test on unknown date with unknown results; Immune markers on 11Mar2021 with unknown results. Clinical course: The patient received the vaccine on 19Feb2021at 10:00 AM and five minutes after, her throat started tightening and they put her in observation for another hour and then her throat felt fine and they let her go. Caller confirmed she was not referring to this occurrence as anaphylaxis.  The anaphylactic reaction occurred days later. She mentioned from 19Feb2021-26Feb2021, her symptoms were progressing and then on 26Feb2021, it was full blown out; the actual anaphylaxis was 26Feb2021. Between this, she had severe double vision, severe rash from face all the way down to toes, one eye going cross eyed (right eye), left eye is still drooping. On 20Feb2021, she started having double vision that started with the sunlight and fluorescent lights and the next day she couldn&#39;t see anything without double vision, and her eye started going cross eyed. She still cannot see normally now. She is under eye doctor care for that too. The patient was treated with Epi-Pen into leg and then into the Emergency Room. She received 50 mgs of Benadryl and 125 mg of Solu-Medrol IM injection, but still have to give Epi because her throat was still closing. Her airway was intact and no nebulizer treatment needed. The patient reported also that her hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch. The patient reported that her weight at that point was 204, the she had been on Prednisone for a week, and her weight has gone up to 210 now. After her throat closed on the 26Feb2021, caller reports she gained 7 pounds while on it for one week. Caller stated she was also put on prednisone when she got diagnosed with asthma, reactive airway. She confirmed her throat stop closing immediately after the Epi. The patient was also treated with 25 mgs of Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Pepcid a day. Outcome for throat closing was improved with medication. Outcome for rash was not improved and she is taking medicine to counteract it; itch went away when she took the Zyrtec. Regarding right wrist pain, it increased dramatically after the vaccine. Caller reports it felt like a spiral fracture down the ulna and it started to ache on 20Feb2021, by the next day it hurt a 5 out of 10. By 22Feb2021, she was wearing a splint, it was 8 out of 10, and she felt like she fractured it and it was swollen on the ulnar side. Regarding eye disorder, she is now under the care of an eye doctor for her severe double vision, eye crossing, and eye drooping. The blurred eyes give bad balance and that kind of stuff. The cross eyedness gives her poor peripheral vision and also her depth perception has now been compromised. They say the glasses will fix it. As of 22Feb2021, a new pair of special lenses with prisms were ordered for her. The patient was not hospitalized.

Approximately 2.5hrs later developed generalized muscle aches, tired, chills.  Next morning muscle aches were less, new headache and dizziness. took Tylenol which helped, about 5 hrs later symptoms worsened, improved with sleep and Tylenol.   Awoke this morning with some chest pain similar to initial response, some headache and dizziness, improved with Tylenol,  now returning (noon).  occasionally feels like I need to take a deep breath.  I believe its mostly muscular pain gets a little worse with deep breathing.  Sent home from work day of vaccine, worked partial days next 2 days

I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

That continued for about 15-20 minutes.  At 30 minutes after the injection my voice went hoarse. About an hour after I had a serve bullet like headache in one point in my head, I took Tylenol and lasted for about 5 hours.  I started taking Benadryl (25mg), the headed improved, but when I woke up in the morning the next day I had all over swelling to the the point where I couldn&#39;t make a fist and had facial swelling .  The facial swelling lasted for 5 days. My co worker took my vitals signs but everything was normal. For the next 5 days I had facial swelling that increased, hands got better. I continued to Benadryl . After the 5th day things finally started to get better. I did go back to have my second dose.  I contacted my PCP but he was out of town .

A 56-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular (IM) in right deltoid on 07Jan2021 15:30 at second single dose for preventative. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016 for immunisation and experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue, first dose bnt162b2, via IM in left deltoid for preventative on 18Dec2020 at 18:00 and patient was tender in her left arm, the first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. No prior other vaccinations administered within 4 weeks. The patient took the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Thursday 07Jan2021 at 15:30. She called employee health and was advised to call Pfizer to report side effects since she is not feeling good. She had never had the covid diagnosis. On Friday (08Jan2021) she worked all day and felt arm soreness and sinus congestion but nothing out of the ordinary. The patient reported her right arm was still tender to touch, if she rotated her arm she can feel that she had the shot and she was still tender in her left arm from the first shot. The first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. On 08Jan2021 evening she felt really lightheaded, she thought maybe it was her sinuses since it is dry due to winter. She felt like a truck hit her. She had a low grade headache. On 09Jan2021, she felt a little nauseous, queasy, no vomiting. On Saturday (09Jan2021) she had a low grade temp of 100.3 degrees F. She had the chills and shakes on Saturday and most of yesterday. She got up today (reported on 12Jan2020) at 5:30 am, she checked her temperature and it was 97.2 after the shower, an hour later it was 98 degrees F. She felt like she had to keep clearing her throat, her chest felt a bit tight which started Friday evening, the chest tightness was not terrible but it was there. She was not wheezing but when she took a deep breath she felt a little like a wheeze and she had to cough, she had a scratchy throat on 09Jan2020. She stayed home from work yesterday. The patient did not feel lightheaded today, felt it yesterday and did not notice it at all this morning, reported it has resolved. The sinus pressure and congestion started Friday night, she felt stuffy. She had a decreased sense of smell and taste on 09Jan2021. Unless something is right in front of her, she could not smell anything. She felt quite nauseous this morning but at the moment her nausea is under control. She had a decreased sense of taste, everything she ate or drunk had a metallic taste to it, on 09Jan2021. She felt that all the side effects mentioned were related to getting the vaccine. On 08Jan2021, she also experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue which had improved after a hot shower, that helped. She felt like she had a bad flu shot. The only time she ever felt similar to this was when she received the H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016. She did not have lot number, NDC, or expiration date to provide. Treatment included: took Tylenol on Saturday. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office (she is trying to get an appointment to see the doctor). Outcome of the event lightheaded was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events low grade headache, chest tightness, scratchy throat, sinus pressure and congestion, decreased sense of smell, decreased sense of taste, everything she eat or drinks has a metallic taste to it, arm soreness was not recovered, of events chills and shakes, muscle stiffness, fatigue was recovering, of other events was unknown.

                                                short of breath; had a high heart rate afterwards; anxiety; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 56-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1686; expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration left upper arm on 31Dec2020 11:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing hyperthyroidism reported as hyperthyroid, historically tachycardia from time to time resting, wears glasses, stressed and ongoing thyroid (thyroid disorder). Ongoing concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid and losartan for blood pressure high. She did not received other vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient stated that she first dose of the Covid vaccine and became short of breath and had a high heart rate afterwards after she got her vaccine. She mentioned that she had a high heart rate and shortness of breath on 31Dec2020 immediately after getting the vaccine. She received it at her workplace (in the hospital conference room) and was taken to the ER to be checked out. It was like soon as she sat down after getting the vaccine, she immediately started to have the high heart rate and shortness of breath. She wasn&#39;t sure if it was anxiety or a true adverse reaction. She further added that at first, she was thinking it was anxiety because she was stressed when first went there. However, she was reading the paperwork and it said high heart rate and shortness of breath could occur. After reading that she realized it may not be anxiety. When she was taken the Emergency Room and her heart rate then was 115-120 [units unspecified], she felt like it could have been higher before it was checked. She was kept in the Emergency Room for like 30 minutes or so for further observation. As a whole, the high heart rate and shortness of breath probably lasted no more than ten minutes. She confirmed she has recovered completely from the high heart rate and shortness of breath as she has not had any other episodes. She added, she gets tachycardia historically from time to time resting. However, she has never had shortness of breath and that is why she was concerned. She wants to know if she should get the second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included EKG (electrocardiogram) and troponin were normal on 31Dec2020. The outcome of the events was recovered on 31Dec2020.

                                                1/21/2021- First Dose-  Following day mild muscle soreness at site, ongoing fatigue, never feels rested or wants/needs to sleep, a lot.  Noticed abdominal pain, but did not connect the two.  2/11/2021- 2nd dose- Two hours later (approx) moderate pain at site, my head/mind felt &#34;off&#34;, out of sync like one side of brain slower,  affected balance. It was strange, and unpleasant.   2/12/2021- Groggy, face/eyes swollen, did not feel well, but not so bad I could not go to work. It was a 50 mile drive, and as I drove the same feeling of not thinking straight did not want to drive. The feeling of being unwell escalated quickly. Congestion, muscle aches throughout, sore throat, chills, and a need to catch my breath caused dizziness. I pulled over, called work, and made my way home where I went directly to bed. My head ached, abdominal (sharp) pains, especially after ingesting fluids. or food similar to gall bladder pain, but not close to its worse intensity still, continues.  2/15/2021- Update- Nearly 96 hrs. passed: What remains is:  Feeling exhausted, need to sleep, more frequent and intensifying abdominal pains, headaches, pain in left lung/easily winded, and site pain expansion. Injection arm (left) pins &amp; needles, and fingers ice cold, neck pain (stiffness).

                                                Developed fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath 1 day after 2nd dose of vaccine.   Started on antibiotics and steroids empirically prior to admission 02/15. Initial CT with diffuse centri-lobular tree and bud opacities.  Infectious (including BAL) and autoimmune work-up without clear explanation for infiltrate. Underwent VATS wedge resection for tissue diagonsis.  Post-op developed hypoxia requiring up to 10L O2 and worsening infiltrates on CT in a pattern consistent with organizing pneumonia (possibly drug reaction).   Started empirically on steroids for concern for organizing PNA/hypersensitivity pneumonitis.   Pathology returned with organizing pneumonia with increased eosinophils.  Timing of onset of symptoms is concerning for a hypersensitivity reaction to the COVID vaccine.   Symptoms are improving with steroids (started 02/26).  Recovery to be determined but I am optimistic for a good recovery.

                                                On Tuesday morning after receiving 2nd vaccination the previous Friday afternoon, I suddenly broke out in hives on both arms and across upper torso that alternated between itching and burning like fire.  It quickly spread over entire body.  I called my PCP to speak to a nurse and while on the phone, I begin experiencing tingling around nose and mouth, nose stuffed up making breathing difficult, and tongue became numb.  PCP office told me to hang up and go to the nearest emergency room.

It lasted for 72 hours and then the symptoms were gone. I took Tylenol the first day. The second and third day, I took Ibuprofen. I called the Dr on the second day - he told me it had to run its course.  I still have residual shortness of breath - I had COVID at the end of July and had severe scarring in my lungs from the lung.

A 56-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9265, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 30Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included food allergy (reported as allergy to walnuts). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a workplace clinic. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 30Jan2021 10:45, both times the patient had right face numbness (felt like Novocaine) that started in her right cheek and spread to her lips and up into her eye and ultimately radiating throughout her head, and also swelling throat/ear canal on right side. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. Clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.

Some improvement but continue to feel somewhat breathless at times, extreme fatigue  (abnormal for me), decreased appetite, muscle aches (severe at times), tightness in my jaw on left side with noticeable jaw clicking that I have never had, and on day 3 woke with severe, noticeable swelling in my left axilla (egg shaped and protruding) and my left neck/jaw -- also seems to be in the lymph node area.

                                                45 minutes after receiving the vaccine I felt like I was helping by getting my vaccine. After 45 minutes I started to get weird symptoms. I started to have a hot flushing sensation in my left chest and became mentally dissociated from the situation. I felt separated from the conversation and tried to touch my hands together and couldn&#39;t feel them it was  like a part of me. I was still trying to function for days and the feeling of being unable to think continued. I remember muscle weakness and dizziness. It was hard to focus. I had body tremors and some nausea and fatigue, headaches, body aches. The dissociation came and went and I felt really wobbly. I tried driving on day four and was unable to function in traffic. I started having abdominal pain which has lasted for five weeks. The flushing was still there in my chest and started to move up into my neck. Extreme dizziness on day 6 and I slept for much of the day, brain fog. I reached out to many doctors for help but no one had advice. I felt really scared and overwhelmed.  Day 8 I had severe nausea and abdominal pain muscle pain in legs and dizziness. I thought I wasn&#39;t going to wake up after sleeping on many days. My muscles hurt so bad that I thought it wouldn&#39;t end. I had many days of day long headaches and the flushing sensation with shortness of breath.   All of my symptoms continued with different levels of severity for five weeks. On the fifth week I had a few days that I thought I was not going to live. I had a band of pain and abdominal fluid that felt hard to touch.  I had no appetite and I still had severe muscle pain.  I was still disoriented and dizzy. Over this time I reached out through telehealth and several medical professional that had no advice.  My symptoms seemed to lessen from the five week point with more periods of feeling more normal.  I have only felt a little normal for three weeks.

Chest got very tight and breathing was strained. Waited with a pharmacy tech, drank water, called husband to come pick me up. Blood pressure went to 178/110, heart rate up to 154 before it subsided. Was able to leave after 45 minutes. Took Benadryl for the next 48 hours to stop reaction. Had waves of the same symptoms several times a day for 4 days after injection.

                                                About 30 minutes after the injection, my throat felt tight like it was closing up. Then I started to have a funny taste, almost like metal in my mouth and my tongue started to fatter as though it was swelling. I never lost the ability to breath but felt a little constricted in my throat. The &#34;puffy tongue side effect lasted for about 15 minutes and drinking water seemed to help. The throat constriction went away after about 5 minutes. We were already away from the vaccine site so we did not see any health professional for these symptoms but would have if they did not go away.

I was given anti-nausea medication.  I found the longer that I spoke the tighter and more sore my throat felt.  Symptoms of lightheadedness, headaches, brain fog, pain in throat, ear pressure, nausea, diarrhea, body aches and pain, chills, fever of 102 at 6am on March 27th, neuropathy was exacerbated, palpitations and sore left arm.  I feel a sharp pain in my right arm, deltoid muscle, when I try to lift it, I can barely move it. It feels as if I had the shot there but I know it was in the left arm for both doses.  March 27th all symptoms continue and my temp is fluctuating between 99.5 and 100.5 so far today.   March 5th 2021- Dose 1 Within 10 minutes I started to feel the vaccine. I felt a few pangs, brain fog, and exhaustion.  The first night I had terrible nightmares.  The first three days I experienced dizziness, light headed and off-balance, headaches, brain fog, pain in throat, ear pain, tinnitus and pressure, nausea, diarrhea, body aches and pain, difficulty breathing, chills, fever of 99.5, neuropathy was exacerbated, heart racing and palpitations and sore arm.   On the fourth day, I felt normal but was very tired.  On the fifth day (March 9th) I again felt exhaustion, brain fog, throat and ear pain, loose stools, body aches and pain, sharp chest pain and neuropathy.

                                                The vaccine site was Community Center being done by Paramedics and Fire Fighters. I received the vaccine and sat down in the chairs to wait the required 15 minutes. Within 2-3 minutes my face got very hot. I could feel the heat under my mask. Another minute or two, just below my knees to my toes started tingling. Another two minutes or so, I felt like my eyes were swelling. I took my glasses off and looked at my husband and asked if my eyes are swelling, he said, they sure are and called over one of the paramedics that were there. They directed me to a more private are and put me on a monitor and monitored my vital signs. My blood pressure which is well controlled on my meds (which I did take that morning) climbed and climbed to 200s/100s. My chest was tight and uncomfortable and getting more difficult to breath. They put and 02 mask on and gave me Benadryl IM. By that time the squad was there and took me to the local hospital ER. In the squad my tongue started to swell. At the hospital they gave me Solumedrol IV which took care of it all. The swelling quickly went away in my tongue and face, the chest pressure went away, and all the other little annoyances like the tingling. The hospital did a chest x-ray and bloodwork. I went home after 3-4 hours with a prescription for Prednisone 50 mg daily for 5 days.  No further reactions after that.

A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 56-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The husband commented that both of them got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 07Mar2021 and some minutes later, the patient started having a reaction that she had to be taken into the ER with an ambulance: her throat started to close, she could not breath and her pressure raised to 230. Until today, she has not fully recovered, and they have been getting in and out of the ER, in fact they just arrived home from there. Physicians only prescribed antiallergy medications and the patient was still having the same problem and her throat itches on an unspecified date. The physicians they have consulted have contradictive opinions about how she should do: one recommended her not to get the second dose while another recommended her to get started again on the series. The husband wants to know what they can do about this. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 56-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 24Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER2613) as a single dose for to prevent COVID (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included having blood clot from 2019 to Mar2021 which the patient stated a couple of weeks ago (Mar2021), she had an ultrascan in her leg and the blood clot was not there, but she is on medication. The patient has recovered completely from blood clot (not ongoing). Concomitant medication included warfarin (WARFARIN) to prevent from having blood clot ongoing since Jun2019. The patient previously took gabapentin for pain but had throat started closing, allergic reaction, coughing and was intubated until she was released from hospital; and albuterol [salbutamol] for dyspnoea but had nebulizer to open up her airways and prevent closing and did not work (drug ineffective). The reporter mentioned that the patient ended up in the ICU because of the COVID vaccine. As soon as the vaccine was administered within seconds, the patient experienced a reaction and was given an epi pen, another epi pen even an epinephrine drip and was sedated and intubated. The reporter mentioned that they gave the patient the first shot of epi pen and it did not work, and she was given a second one and a third one plus steroids. By the time the ambulance people arrived, they hooked the patient up to an IV and gave her additional epinephrine and administered another epinephrine. The ambulance guy told her; she does not need to keep up with them because they needed to go to the hospital ASAP because the patient is not getting better but getting worse. Once the patient got to hospital, she was intubated because her throat was closing. The reporter stated that the patient has allergies to begin with and this was worse than the first time she had to be intubated. The epi pens did not work, the patient was intubated and then had to be sedated. The patient was on Propofol in order to sedate her and later on in the evening was given Fentanyl to relax her then the epinephrine drip was removed at 6 pm on 24Mar2021. The epinephrine drip was started in the emergency room and the patient could not be moved to the intensive care unit until she was somewhat stable. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit and was there overnight and by the time next morning she was able to be extubated where they removed the tube from her around 9:30 to 10:00 25Mar2021. Of course, the patient was taken off Propofol, but she went through a lot and her legs are sore, throat is sore, and is coughing on 25Mar2021 because of the side effects from being intubated and that she went through a lot. The intensive care unit doctor said that the patient can no longer have the vaccine and she would only be 70% protected till whenever they are not sure how long the vaccine will last. The adverse events almost took the patient&#39;s life which made the reporter angry at that. The reporter is not sure what the contents in the vaccine that it in the other drugs and vaccines since there is something that is contained in all of them and the patient was not allowed to have any whether it is the Pfizer or Moderna and it is even up for discussion for even the flu shot because of the reaction and there does not want to be any chances and that everything should be proceeded with caution. The reporter wanted to know what is in the COVID 19 vaccine to see about what could have caused the allergic anaphylactic reaction. The reporter stated and the fact that the epi pen did not work, she was taken aback. The reporter added that the doctor had a hard time intubating because of her throat but they were able to intubate from the second time. The reporter stated that it is taking a while but her wife is recovering and feeling it is taking a while taking a little bit longer. The reporter also stated that they kept the patient in the intensive care unit overnight and after the tube was removed in the morning, by the late afternoon she was moved to a different floor to continue to be observed and the intensive care doctor said 2 days out her wife would be safe to go. The patient stood up but it was hard for her to walk on 25Mar2021 because it could have been from the epi pen, but she is not sure. The patient stated the side effect came out of the allergic reaction and it was on Thursday 25Mar2021. Patient stated the main trouble is her breathing, she is out of breath still and really sore throat on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that the leg sore is still ongoing and is about the same. It was mentioned that the throat sore was still ongoing but some days are worse and some days are better. The patient stated that when she has a problem trying to swallow a tablet and digest it and it gets stuck on Mar2021. It was stated that the cough was not going away. The cough comes and goes away. She will cough for five minutes constantly and then it disappears then she will fall asleep and wake up coughing. It&#39;s as if she is choking (Mar2021). When she is talking, she coughs more. With regards to the allergic anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated she is experiencing the aftereffects of the allergic reaction and being intubated like being out of breath. The patient stated that will come in time and that&#39;s what happens when she gets intubated. Her breathing was heavy and comes back fully with rest on Mar2021. This has taken a lot out of her. She was feeling tired which was still ongoing it is about the same but comes and goes on 25Mar2021. The patient is experiencing lingering side effects and the patient does not feel as if she has recovered completely. It was also mentioned that the patient was intubated on 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021. It was reported that treatment of the patient included Epi Pen, Epinephrine Autoinjector USP 0.3 mg (Epinephrine injection manufacturer was Mylan) which the patient was given at least three injections (two in the right leg and 1 on the left) then received another in the ambulance (unknown site). Patient received an Epinephrine drip and it was like 0.1 mg all the way up until 6 pm (only on 24Mar2021). The epinephrine drip was started when patient was intubated at the hospital. It was given for patient&#39;s allergic reaction through IV. The patient&#39;s lungs were filling up with fluid so her airway was restricting her from breathing and to prevent damage of the lungs that is when the intubation came in. The patient also received Prednisone which the reporter does not recall when this medication was started it may have been after the epinephrine drip was removed but she is not sure if they started the prednisone after or if it was the same evening which the reporter kind of thinks it was. The reporter stated that the patient took Propofol 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 which was given through the patient&#39;s IV and was given to help her airways being intubated, they sedate their patients. The patient also received fentanyl which must have been added either right before Epinephrine drip was removed or after but reporter does not recall. Patient was given Fentanyl 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 through her IV. Patient received this medication to relax because sometimes it is like some patients tend to want to sit up and kind of hear you, hear what people are saying and to relax patient sometimes because they can get scared and not exactly sure what is going on. The events anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary oedema, throat constriction and breathing difficult. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lung was checked from a CT scan was unknown results on 12Jun2019, D dimer test was elevated on an unspecified date, ultrascan in her leg (ultrasound scan) blood clot was not there on Mar2021 and weight was probably weighs 180 or her weight may be a little less like 175 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events anaphylactic reaction and throat constriction were recovering, as for the events leg pain, throat sore, cough and tiredness were not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 56-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 18Mar2021 10:30 (at age of 56 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included: Asthma, immune problems, upper respiratory stuff, all ongoing; Her Diagnosed allergies include iodine fish, Propofol, and preservatives, sleep apnea, had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough (Jan2021) from that. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took iodine, propofol and had allergies. Patient took first dose on 18Mar for reason that patient has lost all allergies that cannot be detected by blood work. After first short she was told to wait an extra 15 mins not vitals taken she can leave a felt like a specimen unpaid but paying with life. Patient started coughing while everyone watched her so she said she better take Benadryl cause she doesn&#39;t wanna die. Patient left had off balance couldn&#39;t see straight. She was the one that had all side effects from vaccine as well as COVID signs. She had research medicine/food that cause her to have anaphylaxis. Patient found same ingredients in vaccine but food and drug said it ok. Patient was an experiment. She need to no from your board it is ok for me to take 2nd vaccine. Patient should be getting paid. Her doctor making it seem it up to her she gotta go out and get and epi pen she cant afford. In running out of gloves and mask. The patient experienced Anaphylaxis, has been trapping food since in her throat, headache with numbness, Cough, blurred vision and nausea from headache, all on 18Mar2021. Caller has been coordinating with the CDC by email. Since day one she had a bad reaction to the COVID vaccine. This has been going on a month now. The CDC advised her not to get the second shot. She has went back and forth with the doctor. She had anaphylaxis from the vaccine. Her throat closed. She had irritation in her throat. She has been trapping food since in her throat. This has been since the anaphylactic reaction. She has to chew her food as fine as possible. She tries not to eat that much. This is still the same. It hasn&#39;t improved or worsened. She has also had a headache with numbness that is pretty much 24 hours a day. This started right after. She really felt it the next day. She tried to take Tylenol for four days, three times a day, and nothing happened. It was not going away. Her doctor also put her on a migraine medication, but it didn&#39;t work either. The headache has worsened over time. No medication is helping, and the doctors are confused. The migraine medicine is not helping. Her pressure is going up and down. She is wondering if she needs an emergency echo to see what is going on. She is still having bad effects. No doctor knows what to do. She has been to a lung specialist. Her cough just keeps getting worse. The cough started to get worse after the vaccine. She had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough from that, but the vaccine made it worse. It is a ruff cough. She is on cough suppressant medication. Caller did not have a prescribing doctor. She got it at the hospital. She figured that was the safest, and since she is a patient there they emailed her because she was eligible to get it. She is mostly calling because the doctors don&#39;t know how to help. She is about to pass out from this headache. She is even losing vision from the headache. She feels like she is going to have a heart attack before her time. They are trying to figure out why her head is hurting. They do not think it is a migraine. Her headache is a 9/11 or a 10/12. She feels like after the vaccine she has been chemically off balance. She wants to get her thyroid checked too. Mostly because her food is getting trapped in her throat. Her throat is irritated and hoarse. The headache has given her blurred vision, and a felling like she is going to throw up. She feels off balance from the blurred vision. Caller had difficulty seeing information on Tylenol and Nurtec. She asked her husband to help. They cannot read the lot on the Tylenol. She has been to so many specialists to try to find answers, and no one has a clue. She saw on Pfizer&#39;s paperwork that she needs to reach out to a immunologist. Her allergist had no clue. From the world trade centers falling she has ongoing issues from that. She has sleep apnea, allergies, asthma, etc.  She spent 30 minutes being monitored at the hospital. She had started coughing. Her husband said she needed water. She always carries Benadryl with her. Finally she felt like she needed to take her Benadryl. It saved her. She knows the Benadryl probably won&#39;t work forever, but she cannot afford an epi Pen. Time of Onset (24 hours clock): right after vaccine (18Mar2021). All events require a visit to Physician Office. She didn&#39;t have to go the ER. She was lucky with the Benadryl. She takes Benadryl with her everywhere even to restaurants. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Treatment received for coughing, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache. The outcome of the event has been trapping food since in her throat, had irritation in her throat, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

After 5-10 minutes  she reported shortness of breath and an anaphylactic type reaction. Patient was administered an Epi-pen by a nurse and the facility, and reported feeling &#34;a little better.&#34; She was also given oxygen and put on a pulse oximeter. Her O2 sat was 99% throughout. She reported before that she had no allergies and no adverse reaction to a vaccine in the past, but after this happened she said something similar also happened in the past with a flu shot. Patient believes this reaction was due to anxiety and not an allergy. 911 was called and arrived about 15-20 minutes after administration and patient was taken to the hospital. A nurse called the hospital 2 to 3 hours later and they reported she was &#34;doing fine&#34; and would be discharged home later today.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure from 2008 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine from 2017 and ongoing at 5 mg at night for high blood pressure, losartan from 2017 and ongoing at 12mg once in the morning for high blood pressure. Following her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020, the patient had throat tightening, metallic taste in her mouth. She was scheduled to have her 2nd dose today (07Jan2021) and would like to know what to do and if she was still covered 80% from the 1st dose of her COVID vaccine shot. When she got her first COVID shot 3 weeks ago she got a metallic taste in her mouth and her throat tightened up a little. Throat tightening happened right after she got the shot and lasted about less than 2 minutes. She also turned red when she got it. Then about 14 hours later, on the same day she got nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak. This lasted until about 20Dec2020 as well. She was supposed to get 2nd dose today (07Jan2021). Before her first shot she had taken paracetamol and hydrochloride prior. She also took both of those today (07Jan2021). But then she was reading through the paperwork and it says that a severe reaction includes tightening of the throat. She was not sure if what she had was truly a reaction or not. She did not have other allergies. She had many flu shots and never had any difficulty with those. She was a nurse, she wanted the second dose, but she was concerned about the throat tightening, and it getting worse with the second dose. She was unsure of seriousness. She figured that she would get aches and pains. Everyone else who got it said their arm hurt, but nothing else. She thought it was weird. She was just wired differently she guesses. The action taken in response to the events for paracetamol and hydrochloride was  unknown. The outcome of events throat tightening, turned red was recovered on 17Dec2020. The outcome of event metallic taste in her mouth, nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak was recovered on 20Dec2020.

Medical history included allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine on 04Jan2021 and yesterday (11Jan2021) she tested positive for COVID-19. Patient would like to know if she should follow-up for the second dose of the vaccine on 25Jan2021. Patient mentioned that maybe she should follow up with the second dose. It was also reported that the patient wanted to know if the vaccine could have given her COVID-19 and tested positive. Patient further clarified it to be the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                Three days following the vaccination I developed acute shortness of breath while sitting at work.  The shortness of breath episodes progressively worsened over the course of 4 days which required the use of an albuterol inhaler to treat the acute symptoms.   The shortness of breath started to increase in both frequency and severity.  On day 7 I began to develop a headache, cough, and fatigue.   Day 9 I developed  a fever 100.8.  I went to urgent care where I was prescribed Qvar steroid inhaler and Azithromycin antibiotic.  A covid-19 test was performed.    Covid test negative.   Today is Day 12, I have 2 days left of antibiotic, shortness of breath is better following steroid inhaler use but returns approx. 4 hours following treatment.  I continue to have a headache, productive cough, and fatigue.

A 57-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) on Deltoid Left for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced a warm feeling in her chest like tingling; kind of short of breath, it went away like she said it was just breath it was like for couple of minutes and then it went away and then she was just fine till it&#39;s been long here honestly about 3 or 4 days later; got shot in her right arm but left hand start swelling up first a little bit and then her left arm start swelling up and it&#39;s just and then that&#39;s the base and then her right hand start very, very mild swelling in her right hand. The hospital think there as some clot or something weird but she did not and then that started going down after that it just started going down and went away and never had swelling since then but this was going to long but this was something weird happened to her. She got chills, She got fatigue. She had increased heart rate after that it started getting worse. She had Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, she had that always but it&#39;s been control. She walked 5 miles daily a day, she was in shape, she had lot since then, so it&#39;s been under control, she never had problem with it until after she got the shot, her heart rate was she had to add medication, she never have to add. She took metoprolol (Treatment) so she added that and she added more and that&#39;s thing get it under control and then she take herself back off because she felt like it was under control but she had GI problems since, now she was getting better now, still have some issue, did not feel good, off and on. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: good on 04Jan2021 (blood work to see if something was going on to her heart, because she had short breath, and everything was good), weight: 166 or 164, SARS Covid antibodies test IgM on 04Jan2021: positive. Treatment: Nurse stated, &#34;No, not now, I had a heart-rate monitor, it&#39;s what for see what is my heart rate, to locate and see what&#39;s going on.&#34; Outcome of left hand start swelling up first a little bit and then her left arm start swelling up/ her right hand start very, very mild swelling in her right hand was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event heart rate increased is related to BNT162B2.  The event is most likely due to underlying paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

I took 2 Benadryl and in about hour the lump feeling was not as bad, lump feeling subsided. I had muscle joint pain the next 4 days and stayed on Benadryl those days until throat and ears felt better. On day 5 my left arm started stinging and broke out in hives , some on torso but mainly vaccinated left arm. I went to primary care to talk to her about my reactions on day -7 . She documented in my records but told me to report through Vsafe  app. I did. I do not want to take 2nd dose after having this happened and no one able to tell me the 2nd wont be worse,

                                                Patient received her vaccine about 11:50 AM and waited in the parking lot (because she is under quarantine and not allowed to enter the facility) for the appropriate 15 minutes. Within about 10 minutes she began experiencing shortness of breath, throat felt restricted and severe nausea. Myself, another pharmacist, and several members of the staff met them in the parking lot and assessed her condition. Because of her symptoms, we determined it was appropriate to go ahead and administer the EpiPen 0.3mg and call 911 at that time. About 10 minutes later we gave her a 25mg oral dose of Benadryl while we waited on the ambulance to arrive. The ambulance arrived within the next 10 minutes and by then the patient stated she was feeling much better. The EMT examined her and declined any further medical assistance. I called the patient at her home 2 hours later and she said she had some light itching and dizziness. I told her the dizziness could be due to the after-effects of the EpiPen but if it worsened or there were any other signs of an allergic reaction to report to the ER immediately or call 911. This may have been more of an anxiety related reaction due to there being no signs of swelling around the lips or mouth, but we decided it would be best to be overly cautious in this situation.

Speech clear, no stridor noted. Pt stated does have a significant allergy history and sees an allergist. Medicated with Benadryl 50 mg po and immediately to ED, registered right away, pt then c/o head and back itching, and taken into triage for assessment by triage nurse.   Per Hospital Note: Patient initially developed hives and itching with progression in symptoms to include shortness of breath and throat tightening. She reported feeling as though her tongue were swelling and having difficulty speaking and having difficulty swallowing. Concerns of impending loss of airway prompted administration of IV Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine which were unsuccessful and therefore emergent intubation was performed.   Patient apparently has had prior anaphylactoid reactions in the past including bee stings and shellfish.

                                                57y/o female presents with mild throat tightness ~15min after receiving Pfizer vaccine into the left arm. She states that it feels as though something small got stuck in her throat and is causing mild discomfort. She reports associated injection site pain, body cramps, and headache. She denies itching, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, blurry vision, presyncope, difficulty swallowing water, or lip/tongue swelling. She reports no change in symptoms after 40min. post-injection.   Physical Exam:  Heart Rate 66bpm, Blood Pressure 115/74, Repeat Blood Pressure at 40min post-injection 120/80 Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm Lungs: unlabored breathing, clear to auscultation bilaterally  Skin: no injection site erythema or swelling. No rash.  No lip/tongue swelling or narrowing of oropharynx.   Plan:  Patient reports that her symptoms have improved at 1hr post-injection and would like to leave. I advised her that she should wait until all of her symptoms have resolved as throat tightness is a concerning adverse reaction. I provided her with options including contacting EMS right now to take her for observation at the hospital, however, the patient declined and said she would not go in the ambulance.  She insisted that she wanted to go home and that her husband was driving and would take her to the emergency room if her symptoms worsen. Patient was well-appearing when she left the vaccination site.

I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, the swelling did not get real bad - it was more of an annoyance. If it had gotten worse, I would have gone to Emergency. It didn&#39;t. Obviously, it&#39;s an allergy, I&#39;m concerned about the second dose.

A 57-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3302, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 05Mar2021 at 00:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), and known allergies to erythromycin. Concomitant medication included atenolol and furosemide, both for unspecified indication. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 12Feb2021 at 15:00 in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Within a few hours after administration of the second vaccine on 05Mar2021, the patient became tired so went to bed early. Upon awakening the following morning (06Mar2021), the patient was nauseous and vomited. She got herself ready for work but noticed she was feeling weak, tired and had short of breath resulting in worsening of symptom. The patient then got in her car hoping to feel better with fresh air. However, her condition significantly worsened resulting in me calling number due to fear that she may expire. Upon arrival of emergency services, her condition significantly worsened, the patient was weak and unable to open car door. She was informed by medical personnel that she began seizing at the scene, in the ambulance and in the ED. Once she was stabilized in the ED, she was admitted for 3 days to continue tests and evaluations. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient had no COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was tested post vaccination via nasal swab on 06Mar2021 and was negative. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, disability or permanent damage.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible temporal association and lacking any reported alternative explanation, a causative role of BNT162B2 vaccine for all reported SAEs cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 57-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8734, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included has back issues, but nothing serious probably for about 7 years and patient stated that she had a Pilates injury and after that her back has never been the same; and patient stated that she was pretty healthy, adding that she was allergic to sulfa, cow&#39;s milk, wheat, and almond. Family medical history relevant to events reported included mom has osteoporosis, and severe dry eye syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as she doesn&#39;t take any regular medicines but she does take regular supplements and herbs and stated that she was very lucky. Patient stated that Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was the he one she trusted the most and she doesn&#39;t want to die from COVID if she gets it. Patient received her dose in her left arm, at the time of administration, on 30Mar2021 14:00, she was breathing out, then her &#34;cheeks, lips, and mouth started quivering/trembling and it was definitely noticeable&#34;.  Patient further stated that while it was being administered her cheeks, mouth and lips started quivering and twitching. She also reported that immediately afterward (30Mar2021), she experienced a swelling sensation on her left side of her face, &#34;kind of how it feels when you have novocaine, but no visible signs of swelling or drooping&#34;.  Her left cheek area felt swollen and tingly. She stated that it felt swollen but it didn&#39;t look swollen, like when you go to the dentist. She also experienced pressure around the eye sockets. She added that both areas under eye sockets felt a little bit weird, tight or something but not like a pain, hard to describe.  All of these symptoms resolved within a few hours, and 24 hours later she&#39;s &#34;pretty much back to normal&#34;.  The pressure around eye socket, lasted for a few hours; while trembling and quivering only happened when the shot was being administered, and 24 hours later, she was pretty much back to normal. Patient asked if this has this been reported before and if she should she get her second dose. Patient stated if this could this be a sign of Bell&#39;s Palsy, and was it likely that she develop Bell&#39;s Palsy (30Mar2021). Patient stated that all her family have all received their doses and no one had this kind of reaction. She wanted to take the second vaccine, just doesn&#39;t want to have a stroke or heart attack or anything like that. She stated that all of her events are completely gone except she still has a little bit of swollen feeling left in her cheek on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the worst, she would say it is a 1, its pretty much gone, the swollen feeling. She stated that provider was aware of the events because she called and told her yesterday. Her family got their vaccines either moderna or Pfizer and have had no issues, other than typical ones such as forearm, a little bit of nausea, or fever but nothing like what the caller has experienced. She was the only one in her family that has had this issue. She did not have any kind of rash, no fever nausea or headache, and stated it was just like getting her flu shot. The patient did not require emergency room and physician office visit. The event swelling sensation on her left side of her face was recovering. The outcome of the other events reported was recovered on 31Mar2021.

Symptoms consisted of perioral tingling, some possible oral swelling, and then subsequent shortness of breath with labored breathing. Initial treatments in the emergency room did result in some symptomatic benefit, however, the patient continued to have an oxygen requirement and demonstrated persistent symptoms of anaphylaxis. She was then admitted to the intensive care unit for higher level intervention.

This 57-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0161; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Apr2021 14:30 (at the age of 57-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not enrolled in any clinical study or program. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ongoing Crohn&#39;s disease, ongoing diabetes mellitus, ongoing neuropathy peripheral, and ongoing liver disorder. The patient had allergic to a lot of antibiotics; she is allergies to metronidazole, Compazine, she is very highly allergic to Compazine, Penicillin, Augmentin, Bactrim, Iodine, Sulfa, IV contrast (iodine), Prozac and Avelox; the allergies to these medications occurred years ago with the same type of reactions with all these medications: Her throat closes up, she turns black and blue (bruising), or she vomits. Concomitantly, the patient takes medications but does not feel her medications are relevant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8730, Expiry Date: 31Jul2021); via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 27Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 57-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported she had her second Covid 19 vaccine on 17Apr2021, it seems like the next day on 18Apr2021, she didn&#39;t feel that good where she has been nauseated, lightheaded, throwing up, can&#39;t eat and has shortness of breath. Every day it seems worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;s sick with something else or if it&#39;s the vaccine. She called and spoke with her doctor and her doctor didn&#39;t know if her symptoms were related to the Covid 19 vaccine or maybe she had bronchitis or COPD (since she does have a history of COPD). No investigation assessment reported. The patient also called her liver doctor who told her to call and report her symptoms to Pfizer. Her symptoms are still persisting. The clinical outcomes of the events, nauseated, lightheaded, throwing up, can&#39;t eat and has shortness of breath were not resolved.

A 58-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number= EH9899), intramuscular on 19Dec2020 07:00 at SINGLE DOSE at Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer female and allergies to shell fish and Latex. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 30 minutes after receiving vaccine on 19Dec2020 07:30 am, patient reported &#39;heart racing, dizziness, flushing, burning pain in her chest, dizziness. tachycardia, nausea and throat tightness. Patient was taken to the ED where she received IV Benadryl and was observed for 4 hours. Patient was discharged home and symptoms subsided. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible temporal relationship between immunization and onset of allergic reaction in a subject with a positive medical history for allergy to food (shellfish); causality cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

A 58-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 08Jan2021 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on left deltoid on 22Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient stated she got her first Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on 22Dec2020 and had no issues really with that one. And then she had second one on 08Jan2021. The first she got in her left deltoid and the second one she had on 08Jan2021, she had in her right deltoid. It&#39;s towards 8:30 in the morning roughly is when she had it. So, during the day went on 08Jan2021, she felt strange but not sick or anything like that. And the day went on to eat something and then came home. And then she&#39;d say at around 7:30 it hit her like with a ton of bricks. She was shaking so bad, she couldn&#39;t even hold anything. And then she was aching all the way from head to toe. And she was like she will get her tooth brush at least. So, she brushed her teeth and then all of a sudden her throat closed up on 08Jan2021 around 7:30 pm and she couldn&#39;t breathe. And she stated she was like &#34;oh my gosh and then it sort of opened up enough for me to scream for my husband, I yell for him to come and then it did it again, it closed up again. And when he came, I started hyperventilating because I was scared. And he calmed me down and rub my back and everything, and it went away. But it scared me. But the shaking lasted probably all through night maybe till 3 in the morning because I tried not to take anything and I probably took 2 Advil. And now I have residual like I am sill aching in my back. And it&#39;s weird, in morning I tasted the food, it tasted funny, like not the same but then at the end of the day I could taste food like normally. And then I had sort of a cough but not like I urge to cough but it was not like chronic. Not a lot but it&#39;s there like if you urge to cough, it doesn&#39;t happen a lot. &#34; The patient stated &#34;It started on 08Jan2021 around 7:30 pm, when my throat get bad. I have muscle soreness specially in my back and I don&#39;t know in the taste in the morning the food doesn&#39;t taste right but then like it&#39;s fine towards the afternoon. And I am still tired and a slight like cough. But the cough isn&#39;t really anything, if I get urge to cough. It&#39;s not all day, it&#39;s not chronic at all.&#34; The patient started to took Advil as a treatment and stated &#34;Well I started to because it was like 3:30 in the morning, or 2 or 3 in the morning I did take 2 Advil. And they helped with that pain.&#34; The outcome of the event taste abnormality was recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By 8:00 p - fever was 100; joint and muscle aches and fatigue; Took Tylenol finally before bed - slept a little bit but woke up with 101 temperature and I took another Tylenol and went back to bed but couldn&#39;t sleep because of pain with muscles; sore throat and it went up to 101.4 - it would go down with Tylenol but it would shoot back up after 4 hours. Rollercoaster with that up through Sunday 10th - all day fever was over 101.4 - 101.6 with extreme fatigue; really bad muscle and joint pain; eat a little and pushed fluids. Didn&#39;t have to work Monday. Rested and I felt a little tight in my chest and took Albuterol. Monday morning temp was 101; but started going down to 99 range fever; I had a previously schedule visit with my dr. and it ended up being a sick visit. He said to keep an eye on it. He told me not to go to work on Tuesday or Wednesday. Things were getting better but still had sore throat; shortness of breath and muscle aches/joint pain but lower temp. Wednesday night I called out from work because things got worse with my breathing/chest got tight etc  but not fever anymore Had a virtual Urgent care visit - for the COVID test. COVID test on Thursday. Went to back to work - and I still have a slight bit of joint pain.

A 58-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, lot number: EL3246; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 16:30 at a single dose at left arm for COVID-19 immunisation, glatiramer acetate (COPAXONE), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for unspecified indication. Medical history included multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient was not pregnant. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EKS730) on 22Dec2020. The evening after the patient had her second Covid vaccine, the patient gave herself Copaxone shot. On 14Jan2021, the patient stated that there was an idiosyncratic reaction that happens periodically. Symptoms were flushing and palpitations. It ends quickly. About 15 minutes after that occurred, the patient had shaking chills (violent shaking) and difficulty breathing. The symptoms lasted about 1 hour. During that hour, the patient had someone drive her to the hospital but during the drive the symptoms calmed down. The patient spoke with one of the nurses that does screening in the lobby and they said many people had been reacting to their second shots, so she didn&#39;t really need to be seen in the ED since her symptoms had resolved. No treatment was received. The action taken in response to the event for glatiramer acetate was unknown. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                After being observed for approximately 20 minutes and patient walked to her car without assistance I was called to assess the patient in the parking lot for troubles breathing.  EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

                                                Pt reported feeling symptoms approx 10 minutes after receiving injection. She complained of mild shortness of breath and &#34;itchy throat.&#34; She was questioned about having any other symptoms and immediately escorted to the medical attention tent. She was seated, and EMS began evaluation; her vital signs were taken: RR 22, HR 82, BP 156/102, PULSE OX 98%. She then reported an increase in symptoms, as face itching, increased tightness in her throat. Objective symptoms observed by myself and EMS: cough/clearing of the throat, increased SOB/labored breathing, facial erythema, hoarseness. EMS asked for her consent to give her Benadryl and Epinephrine. She repeatedly refused this, and refused any attempt at IV placement. She eventually agreed to IM Benadryl, of which 50mg were administered by EMS. Both EMS and I suggested more than once that she allow us to transfer her to the hospital for further management and preparation in the event that she needs further care. I explained that she was having symptoms of anaphylaxis. She repeatedly refused transfer. She reported a decrease in symptoms, saying she felt well enough to go home. Her objective symptoms observed by myself: continued hoarseness and clearing of the throat. VS were repeated: RR 18, HR 68, BP 160/98, PULSE OX 99%. Airway remained patent and clear. Patient again requested to leave, and agreed to EMS escorting her to her car.

I took 1 Benadryl and then another 15 minutes later, then drove home once rxn seemed to stabilize. Took 2 more Benadryl through the course of the evening as flushing stopped but still had throat discomfort and new headache. Also took Tylenol.  In AM, allergic symptoms were resolved,  but had significant arm pain (upper arm around site was very firm and warm to the touch), mild headache, moderate fatigue, and diarrhea. This continued for another 24 hours. Took Tylenol 3 times. Felt fine by Wednesday (2 days after vaccination).

Told me to keep window down and take deep slow breathes. This worked, but maybe to minutes later it happened again. My blood pressure and oxygen level was taken. I was given a banana to eat. I ended up calling my husband to pick me up. On  the evening of Sunday 3/14, I noticed a red patch on my chest. Monday, 3/15 when I woke up, red patches were on my arms, hands , neck and face. Tuesday, 3/16 the red patches had spread up my arm and my eyes were puffy. I went back to the vaccination site and reported it to a medic. I was told to take Benadryl. Wednesday, 3/17 my right eye was swollen more and puffiness under my eye.  My left eye was swollen but not as much. I went to clinic and was given Benadryl and prednisone, and told  to go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Today 3/18 blotches still on arms, hands, neck and chest. Swelling on right eye lid has gone down some.

                                                Within 2 or 3 minutes my left arm was itching, within 10 minutes my head, chest and other arm were itching. I got lightheaded and for an instant felt like I was going to black out but didn&#39;t, in 15 mins my entire body was itching. I was given 1 Benedryl capsule orally and told to wait 15 more mins. The itching kept spreading, I started feeling like I was going into an asthma attack. They had me wait 15 more mins. It seemed to stop getting worse as quickly. They gave me another Benedryl and I left since I did have an Epi-pen with me. I got home and took another Benedryl about an hour later and about every 6 hours. I got up the next morning and felt horrible and was still itching so took more Benedryl. Tuesday night it felt like it was getting a little better but felt like I was having a slight asthma attack but my inhaler wasn&#39;t helping. On Friday I went to my family doctor and was put on a short dose of Prednisone, 20 mg twice a day for 5 days. It did help. Since I&#39;ve gotten the shot, when I eat it&#39;s like my stomach bloats up and diarrhea and generally don&#39;t feel like myself. I was really tired until I got on the Prednisone. Each day I feel more like myself but not back to 100% yet. I started taking my Brio again to see if it would help.

                                                As stated in #11 above, I had just been recovering from something really bad I got hit with in January.  The vaccination seemed to &#34;reactivate&#34; whatever it was, as all the same symptoms started back up that night except for the scalp pain.  Gastric distress wasn&#39;t quite as bad but definitely present.  Breathing definitely compromised, started back up using multiple OTC meds to get airways open.  Breathing continued to get bad for approx 3-4 days, as did gastric issues.  Started getting better on 5th day, then by 7th day doing a lot better.

                                                Within a minute or receiving the COVID 19 vaccine I began experiencing tingling and numbness in my lips, tongue, mouth and throat. My throat felt like it was closing or tightening and I had difficulty swallowing. I was administered Benadryl at the vaccine site and then transported by ambulance to the Hospital. There I was given an IV with peptide, steroid and benadryl. After a couple of hours, my symptoms began to improve and I was released.  I continued to experience irritation of my tongue and mouth and a sore throat until the next day.

                                                allergic reaction to the first dose; Felt like her throat was constricting; Very flustered while driving home, somehow missed her exit; face is swollen; fast heartbeat; heart racing really fast; This is a spontaneous repot from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199), intramuscular in the muscle of upper left arm (deltoid left) on 03Mar2021 17:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a pharmacy, not a facility. No other vaccines were administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included hormone replacement therapy, high blood pressure, and &#34;very sick she guessed from a cold and had asthma&#34; on 2011 (from 10 years prior to the report; this was the only time she had asthma, and her physician said her asthma can come on because of being sick). The patient stated that she generally has higher blood pressure than she would like, but she is otherwise very healthy, and never had an allergic reaction to anything. Family history relevant to the adverse events was none. Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) for high blood pressure, valacyclovir (VALACYCLOVIR), rosuvastatin (ROSUVASTATIN), omega-3 nos (OMEGA-3 NOS, capsule), estrogen (ESTROGEN) for Hormone replacement therapy, progesterone (PROGESTERONE, 100 mg capsule) for Hormone replacement therapy, all were from unspecified date and ongoing. It was reported that patient gets her flu shot every year and never had an adverse reaction. The patient reported that she had an allergic reaction to the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE she received last Wednesday (03Mar2021) after an hour after she received it (18:45) while driving. She mentioned that she saw on the package insert what a severe allergic reaction would include. She experienced swelling of the face and a fast heartbeat but no difficulty of breathing on 03Mar2021. The patient further explained that she had her first dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE on 03Mar2021 around 17:15 at a pharmacy. She left the pharmacy around 17:30. While she was driving home, she started to feel her heart racing really fast and felt like her throat was constricting within about 30 minutes of being administered the vaccine, by around 17:45. She was very flustered while driving home which is usually about 30 minute drive; but somehow she missed her exit and it was rush hour so it was about 18:15 when she got home. When she got home her husband asked her if she had been crying because he said her face looked weird. She told him he thinks her face is swollen. All of these events lasted maybe 1-2 more hours or less after she got home around 18:15, maybe a few hours before she recovered completely. She was expecting soreness and pain from the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE but was not expecting the fast heartrate or swelling. She was reading through the information she got from the pharmacy for the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE because she was a little concerned about getting the second dose due to these events. She has never had an allergic reaction to anything before and wondered if she should go to a hospital for her second dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE in case she has these events again, or a worse reaction. She asked about these events and dosing recommendations for the Pfizer. The reported adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the events was recovered on 03Mar2021.

                                                This was a 58 year old female who received her 1st dose Pfizer on 4/6/21 (Lot# EW0175) and 2nd dose Pfizer on 4/27/21 (Lot# EW0151).  Of note, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident on 4/12/21 with a diagnosis of concussion and cervical/thoracic strain/sprain (see history under patient information).  On 4/29/21, the patient&#39;s sister contacted the patient&#39;s primary care clinic with the following documented concern:  &#34;Pt&#39;s sister calling to report that two days ago pt got 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine and has been sick. This morning they found her passed out against the her bedroom door. Pt reports that she can&#39;t remember much other than going to the bathroom.  Pt&#39;s sister states that patient totaled her car a week ago, and that it was determined she had a concussion.  &#34;She hasn&#39;t been herself since the wreck and I am very concerned.&#34; This caller recommenced the Ed or UC but caller denied stating that either needs to see her today. This writer is reaching out to nurse to see if they can advise from here.&#34; A RN assessed the patient virtually with the following documentation:  &#34;RN note:  Call transferred from patient&#39;s sister.  Pt noted to be found on her floor this morning. Pt unsure if she hit her head.  Spoke to patient.  She reports body aches, and feeling weak.  Pt is slow to answer questions, and had a lot of difficulty hearing me (sister did not have any difficulty hearing me).  Pt is noted to have more rapid breathing, and some slight wheezing.  Speech is clear when she is speaking.  Sister gave patient water to drink.  She drank out of bottle and was able to hold on her own (though had difficulty with this at first).  Sister noted some water dripping down face, but was able to swallow okay.  Sister also noted that patient&#39;s lips seem to be pursed. Plan: Given recent concussion, and patients change in behavior per sister (pt more irritable, speaking more slowly, moving slowly, breathing faster, and wheezing), recommended patient be taken to the ED today--recommended ambulance since it took 2 men to help patient back to bed this morning.  Sister states patient is not agreeable to going to ED at this time.  Advised to try to encourage her to drink more fluids, and continue to monitor her sxs, and if any worsening, to call for ambulance transport.  Sister agreeable to plan, and will discuss with sister, and recommend ED visit today.&#34; On 4/30/21, the patient&#39;s sister contacted the clinic to inform them that the patient was found dead that morning.  The medical examiner is completing the further investigation. If additional information is needed from the primary care physician for this patient.

                                                Short of breath; Fluish symptoms; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 59-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL1283, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm, from 08Jan2021 at 11:30, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization and progesterone at 700 mg, daily (takes 300mg  in the morning and 400mg and night) and then 200 mg (yesterday took 200 mg and today she took 200 mg), at unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified dates, for perinatal menopause symptoms. Medical history included allergic reaction to Penicillin, ongoing borderline high blood pressure, sleep apnea, perinatal menopause symptoms, and allergic reaction also with Sulfa drugs, it is hives and wheals with Sulfa drugs and overweight. The patient previously took prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Diavan and experienced angioedema and allergic reaction, and first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number is EJ1685 with expiration Mar2021) on the right arm, on 18Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about Pfizer COVID vaccine number 2. She knows she could go on the website but she also had a question she would like to see if she could be answered. She said she took the COVID vaccine 2 on 08Jan2021, Friday, and on 10Jan2021, Sunday she noticed she couldn&#39;t breath after taking her Progesterone. She takes Progesterone for perinatal menopause symptoms and she really needs it. She noticed about 20-25 minutes after taking her progesterone that she was short of breath and this has continued if not increased. It is not going away since then and she is wondering if there is any end in site. She went to a physician that is very knowledgeable and he said it is triggering an inflammatory response but she is really short of breath she is walking around with a O2 sat monitor on. She doesn&#39;t know if there is any end in site. She does not want to have to go in the hospital. Mainly after she takes her progesterone she is short of breath and she has gone down on her  dosage a lot and she still having shortness of breath. She took the progesterone and 25 minutes later she became short of breath. The reaction has increased since it started on Sunday evening, 10Jan2021. She is noticing, she is still taking it and it has a long half life but even with dropping the dose a lot even with that it has stayed the same or gotten worse. She says she took her Progesterone on Saturday as she normally would. But Sunday morning when she took her 300 mg in the morning about 20 minutes or 25 minutes after she was very short of breath like she can&#39;t get a whole breath of air. She has reduced the dose she is taking now. Yesterday she took 200 mg and today she took 200 mg. She has been on it for 3 years and she has never had shortness of breath. She has never had shortness of breath before even though she is overweight she has not had shortness of breath unless she is running or some sort of exertion this is totally new. She said her initial side effects the fluish symptoms and fatigue began Friday evening on 08Jan2021 and had resolved completely on Saturday, 09Jan2021. Outcome of short of breath was reported as worsened (not recovered). The action taken for progesterone was dose reduced.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event short of breath is more likely due to progesterone based on more close temporal relationship.  However, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took my albuterol inhaler,  which did very little, so i added 20 mg prednisone tablet that i carry with me for emergency.  Benadryl/Aleve mix (2 Aleve pm) taken at bedtime to assist in sleep and reaction.  By 7:30 am i could not breath,  peak flow meter revealed reduction to 68% capacity, so I took 60 mg prednisone,  continued with albuterol inhaler q 4 hours,as i did the evening before.  Then  added Montelekust and allegra (antihistamine).  Fever reached 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit,  taken Temporal method- high for me,  as i run low.  An hour later,  elevated temp to 100.5, same method,  and has remained throughout the day and evening.

                                                About 4-5 minutes after getting the vaccine, I coughed and then could not breathe. I was sitting down and quickly stood up gasping for air. I was in the library at the time.  Several people ran to my side and sat me down on the floor. My O2 sat was 86, pulse 120. I was able to start breathing without epi. O2 went up to 100. Was taken to the ED and given Benadryl and Prednisone. I waited quite a long time. The ED was packed. I ended up leaving, as I felt fine. I am fine today and at work. This was my second vaccine.  No adverse event after the 1st dose.

She was further evaluated where she was noted to be dyspneic (diffuse wheezing in pt with history of asthma) and was noted to have a labile heart rate.  Her heart rate increased from 80s at rest to 139 with ambulation.  Given her dyspnea and very labile heart rate she was encouraged to go to the ED for further evaluation but patient declined.  Cardiologist office alerted and she will follow up with him.  EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  Of note the pt is actively being treated for an arrythmia and recently adjusted her beta blocker.

                                                On March 5th (day 11 after vaccine) I awoke with red rash/hives on palms of both hands and elbows and underside of forearms and upper left thigh. The rash got worse each day spreading all over my body causing me to seek medical treatment first with primary doctor who gave me prednisone pack and injection and then my local emergency room (twice) due to swelling of throat and tongue. I was given prednisone IV treatment and sent home with a high dose of medication for inflammation and hydroxyzine for itch and famotidine for stomach upset.  My doctor got me in to see immunologist for tests and treatment. That doctor took blood and diagnosed me as having a moderate to severe delayed allergic reaction post covid vaccination. My liver had elevated levels of bili-rubin my white blood count was over 16,000 and my skin was cover in red, itchy hives and rash from head to bottoms of my feet for over ten days. I was very sick and miserable.

Then 30 minutes after ( now 45 minutes after vaccine) started getting nerve problems behind left eye that was bothering me. Then my face got nerve problems too. Then all my teeth on top and bottom row were hurting. my lips and tongue got numb with nerve problems like I had too much Novocain. Then my throat felt like it was swelling up. I called hot Line of vaccine to report side effects. They transferred me to a Covid 19 nurse that said go to emergency room right away sounds like yiur getting Bell?s palsy.   FYI my brother who lives in another state did not report his side effects. In February he got the second dose of Pfizer and he said four hours after he got nerve problems in his face and his right side of eye and mouth drooped and he was talking strange like someone with paralysis of mouth . Still has it but never went to doctor and won?t fill out info to report

I moved from back to the front as i felt cold and was swearing. It was sift chsnge and the staff was huddled in a corner and i called for help.2x before taking off my mask amd callinf a thried time. By this point i felt like vomiting and nedded immediate water. The thirst was intrnse. The University of Arizona didn&#39;t have anything for me to throw-up into except a half full used large janitorial garbage can.  I was given water and that really helped the thirst and nausea. The nurse came and put a monitor on my finger and immediately took me to a back area where rhe cold sweat and chills now covered my whole body and the thirst returned. Tje nurse took my vitals and i remember my heartbeat reading in the 30s and had a very low blood pressure. No one ever experienced what was happening and i asked if i was going to die. The only thing they had to lie down on was an army cot 6&#34; off rhe ground. I wanted to lie down so badly buy it had no sheets, pillow or anything. With all the money they get from the feds they should be able to afford a gurney. I was never told the truth about what had happened to me. I was let go with a very low heart rate of 51. My normal is 68 to 78. No follow up instructions.

An Epi-Pen (branded generic form) was administered in addition to two diphenhydramine 25mg tablets.  Patient was given a bottle of water.  Over the course of approximately 7 minutes she consumed about one-half of the bottle.  Paramedics were called.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Mar2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included exposure to SARS-COV-2 on 02Mar2021 (reported as &#34;daughter tested positive for COVID on 02Mar2021, patient had been around their daughter and their daughter&#39;s husband, they went out to eat with them on the night of 02Mar2021&#34;). Concomitant medication included esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 09Mar2021, the patient received her first shot. About 20 minutes after she took the shot, she started feeling bad and became nauseated/felt sick to stomach. On 09Mar2021, the top part of her stomach would hurt, and she started developing a cough. On 11Mar2021, the patient felt like she doesn&#39;t have any energy. The coughing went pretty bad so on 12Mar2021, the patient took a COVID-19 PCR test and it came back negative. The patient kept having a bad cough so then they went to the doctor where they put the patient on prednisone 20 mg and amoxicillin 875 mg on 12Mar2021. On 16Mar2021, the patient went to the family doctor and the doctor put the patient on azithromycin and gave her a steroid shot. Then the patient kept coughing and her stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage. The patient was never getting better or anything. So, on 18Mar2021, the patient had COVID-19 Virus test where they swabbed her nose and the test came back negative. The patient was taken to the hospital on 19Mar2021 at 11:30 where they did an x-ray of the patient&#39;s lungs and her O2 level was 82-86 sitting in the bed (also reported as 84-86 so she was put on oxygen), performed CT scan of her lungs and it looked like there was inflammation in the lower lungs that was rubbing on her diaphragm, and performed Chest CT which determined pneumonia. That night they did another COVID-19 virus test where they went really deep and it came back negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the night of 19Mar2021. The patient was given IV ceftriaxone, IV azithromycin, azithromycin (also reported as Zythromax), one breathing treatment, and they said they may have to send the patient home with some oxygen. It was also reported that on 19Mar2021, the patient did really good with coughing, she didn&#39;t cough that much. The patient had a dry cough that wasn&#39;t productive at all. The patient acted kind of short of breath because she wasn&#39;t breathing deep because of the pain in the top part of her stomach, but the reporter doesn&#39;t believe it was true shortness of breath. When the patient got out of the hospital on 22Mar2021, she didn&#39;t need to come home with the oxygen. The patient&#39;s oxygen level is running pretty good at the time of the report, in the lower 90s (Mar2021). The patient was on Decadron 6 mg for 5 days and she&#39;s doing pretty good, she still has a little bit of a cough. It was also reported that in Mar2021, the patient only ate about half of her breakfast, this lasted for several days, she wouldn&#39;t eat much. The patient pretty much recovered from the nausea. When she ate, it felt like everything would make it to her stomach and just sit there. The emergency room doctor said it could be from gastroenteritis, also they gave the patient several rounds of Protonix. The patient usually takes Nexium every night. The doctor felt that this event could very well be from the vaccine. The reporter asked if the patient could get the second shot on 30Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Cough/bad cough/dry cough&#34;, &#34;Stomach pain/top part of her stomach would hurt/stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage&#34;, and &#34;O2 level was 82-86/ Oxygen level was like 84 or 86 so she was put on oxygen&#34;; has recovered from &#34;nauseated/felt sick to stomach&#34; on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events &#34;inflammation in the lower lungs that was rubbing on her diaphragm&#34;, pneumonia, &#34;feeling bad&#34;, &#34;ate about half of her breakfast, this lasted for several days, she wouldn&#39;t eat much&#34;, &#34;feels like she doesn&#39;t have any energy&#34;, &#34;gastroenteritis&#34;, &#34;short of breath&#34; and &#34;she wasn&#39;t breathing deep&#34; was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021329963 Same reporter, drug and event; different patient

Three days later, on 3/7/21, you began to have fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and chest pressure.

A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ENB207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 19Mar2021 08:00 AM (at the age of 59-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma since 1990, obese since 1990, Congestive heart failure about 4 years ago in 2017, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease since 1989; all were ongoing. She had a chemical exposure in a small town that started the COPD since about 1989. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received fluzone on unspecified date for flu vaccine and caused COPD exacerbation, she was given doxycycline and prednisone with that. The patient is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19, her first dose she received on 19Mar2021. She isn&#39;t going to take the second Covid 19 vaccine. On 19Mar2021 at 7:00PM on the day she received her Covid 19 vaccine her arm was killing her all the way down/ arm hurt so bad she wanted to cut it off. That lasted the whole next day and she took 2 Tylenol arthritis pills. Her arm was real sore the next day but it wasn&#39;t paining her like it was that first day. It was still a little sore but not like it was. The pain was down the whole arm.  Last week (on unspecified date in Mar2021), she started getting headaches and chills.  She&#39;ll get a chill and the chill will go away. Then a couple hours later the chills will come back. Her headache comes and goes. She checked her blood pressure and her blood pressure is normally low, she checked it and it was 117/76 in 2021. She knew her blood pressure wasn&#39;t causing her headaches. And she checked her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 and it was good. She normally does not have headaches. She&#39;s on 4L of oxygen because of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her breathing has been, she can&#39;t describe it. Her doctor prescribed some steroids yesterday, 30Mar2021. She is asking if this is normal after 2 weeks. When asking her about her breathing she reports it&#39;s like her chest is tighter and she has shortness of breath. If she moves, her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 drops with the slightest little movement. Her oxygen has been dropping into the 70s and she has to do the pursed lips breathing to recover. It&#39;s taking a while to recover. She has to really work to get her oxygen back into the 90s. That started last week some time. She did call her doctor and her doctor prescribed prednisone and doxycycline (Prednisone 4, 10 mg tablets for 3 days, then 3 tablets for 3 days, then 2 tablets for 3 days, then 1 tablet for 3 days and Doxycline Hyclate 100mg 1 capsule twice daily for 7 days). She forgot to mention that her left leg hurts from her knee to her hip on unspecified date in 2021. That started a couple days ago. She didn&#39;t have any problems with her hip before. She&#39;s scared because the second vaccine is more potent, it&#39;s worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;s going to get that second Covid 19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 22Feb2021 11:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9266) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included arrhythmia, ear infection. Concomitant medication(s) included propranolol (PROPANOLOL [PROPRANOLOL]) taken for arrhythmia from Apr2020 to an unspecified stop date.  The patient previously took augmentin [amoxicillin;clavulanic acid] for ear pain and experienced rash on her elbows and palm and arm. Caller stated on Friday 05Mar2021, which was the 11th day after getting the Pfizer COVID Vaccine although she noticed symptoms on the 10th day 04Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine, states she noticed she had a hive rash on her palm and hand and elbows/rash on her palms, hands, elbows, and left hip and it was strange and her elbows were red and were itchy on the palms like red and itchy and she could see the rash starting on the left inside forearm; from there as the day wore on into the next day the rash became worse and more areas of the body were covered with the rash. States she made an appointment on that Monday morning with her HCP and had gone into the HCP office at that time; states on 08Mar2021, she was in distress with her throat starting to swell, her tongue started to swell/ her lips and tongue began to swell and she was covered with the hives and rash from head to toe. Caller states she was started on Prednisone at her HCP office and it was one of those dose packs; states she has no lot numbers to provide. Later on that evening she needed to go to the emergency room and she had become more severe and had a big dose of Prednisone at the emergency room and at that time the HCP there did believe she was having what is considered a post COVID vaccine delayed allergic reaction and hives; states she was in the emergency room early and was there past midnight and thinks she presented to the emergency room on 09Mar2021 and then most recent results she has of her paperwork were from 09Mar2021 to 10Mar2021; no further details provided by the caller. Caller states she was in the emergency room rolled over to the next day on the 09Mar in the evening around 10:30pm and concluded her ER visit on the 10Mar after 12:30. Caller states the HCP gave her the 40mg dose of Prednisone by injection and she has no lot number; states then at the ER, they gave her Prednisone 125mg IV and she has no lot number; they gave her hydroxyzine which is Atarax by IV and gave her Pepcid for her stomach at the same time; no lots for the Pepcid or Hydroxyzine. States the reason for her visit was allergic reaction, allergy hives, post covid delayed reaction. States she let them know at the site that before the vaccine she felt like she might have had an ear infection and was not taking anything no vitamins or anything like that and no Tylenol or anything for a week or so prior because she wanted nothing to be in her system other than the vaccine should anything happen. Had the vaccine that day, later on that afternoon contacted her HCP felt like she had ear infection, no fever but had fullness and some pain in her right ear. Saw her HCP at that time and took a look inside her ear and felt that she did have an ear infection without fever but was painful to the touch around her ear underneath her ear; prescribed Augmentin which she has taken before. Started taking one Augmentin pill on the 23rd in evening which would be Tues 23Feb2021 for the 1st dose, 500mg and dose supposed to take following the next day was to take two tablets one tablet twice per day which she did finish up around 10 days of that on 04Mar. The day before all this started with the rash she finished Augmentin, went to the HCP and two things happened; she was taking Augmentin and had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. States she had the rash on her elbows and palm and arm and she was like that coincides with the Pfizer vaccine but also was on Augmentin and had been on that before with no problems; thought it was either the vaccine or being on the Augmentin as the reason for the rash but narrowed it to the vaccine. States she ended up in the hospital that evening on Monday evening of 09Mar and it was something they had not seen but were prepared to see could happen and concluded the rash was from the vaccine. Caller states she went to see her immunologist at the conclusion of this event and she was still covered in hives and rash and did step her down on the Prednisone and prescribed her hydroxyzine and topical itch stuff. Caller states she has no lot numbers to provide for the topical stuff or the hydroxyzine or Prednisone. States the HCP concluded she could not receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine or any other vaccine that comes forward and she is not a candidate because of this reaction he can&#39;t safely say it would be ok to get a 2nd dose of the vaccine; states she can&#39;t receive a 2nd dose of any covid vaccine and it worried her because she has to be ok with having had the 1st dose of the vaccine and wants to know where she stands with that and what to do and she just doesn&#39;t know. States it is not she herself saying she can&#39;t get the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine but under her HCP advice and two ER visits and many doses of Prednisone and she presented how she looked and that prompted the HCP to say no 2nd dose for her. States she was taking Prednisone started two days of 50mg then 2 days of 40mg, then 30mg, then 20mg, then 10mg and that brought down the amount in her system; states she was given Hydroxyzine 1-2 tablets every 4 hours of 25mg and has no lot numbers for the Prednisone or Hydroxyzine. Caller states instead of taking Benadryl she was taking the topical stuff because Benadryl was not really working and she took Benadryl 25mg tablets in the beginning to try to get the itching out of her system and she felt really really tired and was so tired from taking the Benadryl; caller states she has no lot numbers to provide for the Benadryl. She was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine and the thinks it tended to work better and she did not take a drastic amount of it but it could cause drowsiness and she did feel a lot better from taking it but did not have a really bad feeling of feeling really dopey and sleepy with it because she felt bad enough and did not want to feel bad. States she kept on this for the 10 days or more of a 14 day course and was feeling like until it started to subside. On an unspecified date it was reported that Her WBC count was high and her &#34;liver was not doing great&#34; but recent bloodwork shows it has returned to normal. The patient was hospitalized for the events developed hives/rash on her palms, hands, elbows, and left hip, elbows were red, hive rash on her palm and hand and elbows and it was strange and her elbows were red and were itchy on the palms like red and itchy, her lips and tongue began to swell, WBC count was high, liver was not doing great, post COVID vaccine delayed allergic reaction. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included white blood cell count: returned to normal on an unspecified date, white blood cell count: high on Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events except for WBC count high and liver was not doing great. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 59-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number ER8727, expiration date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 07Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy ( macro Danton, sulfa). Patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included Nerontin. The patient reviously received flu vaccine and had normal things, previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN5318; Expiration Date: 31May2021) in arm left on 17Mar2021 16:00 and experienced acute lymphatic response, brain fog and arm started to hurt. The pateint was calling because her doctor, who she saw yesterday 14Apr2021, told her she should let Pfizer know what was going on. She had a reaction to the Pfizer Covid19 Vaccine. she was now having PVCs. The patient added that all of the events started with a fever, and throwing up. She had a fever and threw up for 36 hours. She had to contact her physician to get medication and to stop vomiting and the nausea and everything. During that time, she was sick. She was having intermittent breathing issues which she did not think she felt too much of until after the other sickness was over. She was weak, like people get after they are sick, and had bizarre shaking legs and arms which was strange. She added that she had breathing issues and difficulty breathing and hard to get a breath. That was what she was dealing with. Treatment: caller took Pedialyte and all the proper things to get back into better shape. The breathing issue still remained. The doctor called in a rescue inhaler. She kept going downhill so he called in a rescue inhaler. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Caller added that this one will not be believed but on Monday, she woke up and got dressed again and was just weak and had breathing issues but was just doing work on the laptop. She did not fall, she did not run into anything. In the evening, she went to take a bath and saw that when she took her clothes off there was a large black bruise on her left breast, it was probably 2 inches in diameter. It is very large, but does not hurt like a bruise. She checked the rest of her body for blood issues and only saw a couple normal looking bruises. She contacted her doctor, and they questioned her thoroughly on her bruising and activity. This was on Monday. Tuesday, she still felt the same headache, weak, and breathing issues. PVCs (Ventricular premature beat) after second vaccine: Yesterday, 14Apr2021, she started declining and the doctor wanted to see her. Caller stated the doctor heard PVCs in her heart. Caller asked clarification of PVC abbreviation and does not provide. She never had heart issues ever. The doctor did blood work and a chest x-ray, and saw the bruise and was worried about her blood. Caller added that even though these are not listed as side effects of the vaccine, she was worried. Her doctor sent her to a facility for chest x-rays to make sure there is no pulmonary embolism. Caller confirmed this was on 14Apr2021. She has not yet heard back. PVCs after second vaccine: Caller added the doctor said her lungs sounded good but wanted to see what was going on to see how her breathing was because there was difficulty. The doctor wanted to cover bases and check. Today, caller can tell her heart is still not in correct rhythm and that it is in continued PVCs. She still had the same breathing issues, limbs were weak, she was shaky, and she is lightheaded. She was hoping to wake up today and feel better. Fever after second vaccine: started 3am 08Apr2021. She had a fever and was throwing up at this time. Throwing up and nausea after second vaccine: caller add that throwing up and vomiting with nausea occurred at 3 am, all of this occurred 08APR2021. The vomiting lasted 36 hours, and it ended when she took medication. The fever lasted 40 hours. Even after the medication worked for her fever, she had nausea. Around Friday was when it went away. Intermittent breathing issues after second vaccine: caller adds it started with throwing up and fever, but she did not think a lot about this or know when it started because she was dealing with the fever and vomiting. It continued, and it has not subsided or ended. As a matter of fact, there are 2 or 3 times it has gotten bad which is why she was given an inhaler. Treatments: caller took a Phenergan suppository, which she adds is the best medicine in the World for nausea and beats Zofran. She had used two or three doses and it did work. She used a rescue inhaler, Albuterol Sulfate HFA. She took Tylenol for fever. She is also now taking an aspirin daily because of the blood issues. No additional information regarding the products. Weak after second vaccine: caller adds that this started at the same time, she was over the nausea and noticed this. It felt different than what it feels like with the flu. This is still going on, she did not think too much about it but it has persisted. Sometimes there is a little bit of shaking but that is intermittent. Caller states she can not put it into words. Bizarre shaking legs and arms after second vaccine: this goes with the weakness, she is continually weak but she has a shaky feeling that will come every now and then and is random. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Monday this started, 12APR2021 and it is still there but it is the same. It has not been sore like a bruise but it is black and large. The physician has seen it now and it is bizarre and scary. It is the left breast on the outside.  Headache after second vaccine: started probably an hour after the vaccine, pretty quick. There were degrees to this headache because it was an actual migraine for a good 48 hours and even after the fever was gone it was terrible. It started out just a mild headache and then was very severe for a couple of days. Then, after that it was just there but not as severe. PVCs after second vaccine: caller adds that she went to the doctor yesterday 14APR2021 and she can tell every now and again that she is having these but there is nothing she can do about it. Caller adds this is everything new she can think of, but some of it is foggy, she thinks this is the main information. Brain fog after first and second vaccine: Caller then states, by the way, after both vaccines within 2 or 3 minutes of having them her head started feeling foggy and weird.  Investigations: caller has not received any results yet. She did get an EKG, Chest XRAY, blood work, and the doctor also rattled off a bunch of things the doctor was going to check. These all were on 14Apr2021 and she is waiting on results. Caller confirms the physician told her she had PVCs while listening to caller&#39;s heart. Did any AE require a visit to: Physician office? 15Apr2021 she was in contact with her physician, and the whole week they were on the phone. Yesterday 14Apr2021 the physician wanted to see her. The doctor figured out something was going on with her heart so thankfully the doctor wanted to see her. It was discussed if caller should go to the ER but caller did everything she could not to go because that is the last place she wants to go. Emergency Room: no. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of fever, vomiting, nausea was recovered, intermittent breathing issues, shaking legs and arms, weak, severe migraine, headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 16:00 (Lot Number: EN5318, Expiry date: 31May2021) on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. Historical Vaccine included flu shots. The patient stated her physician told her she had an acute lymphatic response. She added there was something about 3 am (18Mar2021) because she woke up at 3 am and had severe pain in some of her lymph nodes. In particular, the ones around her ovaries. She added that she was old and her ovaries had not worked in a long time. She had severe pain like cysts except both sides were hurting. She also had trouble catching breath with the pain. This lasted 45 minutes and subsided. The next morning 18Mar2021, when she got up some of her lymph nodes were very panful and there was one even that was a node visible down her throat almost at the base of her neck in the center. She could see it sticking out, it was crazy. It went down in about three days. The pain and the weirdness in all of her other lymph&#39;s was about 3 or 4 days. It was an odd response and people told her it was just her body acting like a young person and was going to work. This was the first issue she had with the vaccines. The patient also experienced brain fog after first vaccine on 17Mar2021: within 2 or 3 minutes of having them her head started feeling foggy and weird. It was after the first vaccine, she thought it was psychological but it did not go away and it was not psychological. It was like a weird foggy and like taking sinus medication, no additional details. When it happened with the first vaccine, it did not concern her as much as the first one. It went away after the first vaccine probably late that evening (17Mar2021), around 10:30 pm right when her arm started to hurt. She did not have arm pain that was severe. She added maybe it lasted a day. The next day it hurt but it was not anything bad, it just hurt to touch it and to lift it hurt for a day. Maybe this was for 36-40 hours before the pain went out. The outcome of event &#34;trouble catching breath with the pain&#34; was resolved on 18Mar2021 03:45, outcome of event &#34;brain fog/head started feeling foggy and weird&#34; was resolved on 17Mar2021, outcome of other events were resolved in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Cervical vertebra #8 through Lumbar vertebra #5 is very, very painful; in excruciating pain; muscle tenderness; muscle tightness; pain feels like someone kicked her in her kidneys; pain feels like it&#39;s punching her lungs; pain is a 10 plus in both flanks; back pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 20Apr2021 08:26 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing hypertension, ongoing mitral valve prolapse, ongoing Tarlov cysts and ongoing mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. The patient had a neurological condition caused Tarlov Cysts. These cysts populated right outside of the dorsal root nerve system. In her, it&#39;s cervical vertebra #5 all the way down her spine bilaterally. In May2018, she had a surgical procedure, not an aspiration, for 8 of the nerves in her sacrum. She has had complications ever since. Cervical vertebra #7 and #8 have been giving her the most problems.  Concomitant medications included ongoing oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone terephthalate, paracetamol (PERCOCET) 10mg every 4 hours taken for pain, and her doctor recently changed it; ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) injection and something for acid reflux but she did not think that&#39;s relevant. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm right on 16Mar2021 9:48AM for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 59-year-old and she had no problems just soreness in her arm. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. She had her second Covid 19 vaccine yesterday morning, 20Apr2021. Cervical vertebra #8 through Lumbar vertebra #5 was very, very painful from 20Apr2021. She didn&#39;t know or hasn&#39;t heard if the Covid 19 vaccine is associated with her back pain. This pain that she&#39;s having now didn&#39;t feel like the pain she had related to her Tarlov cysts.  Before the Covid 19 vaccine she had no problems until late last night (20Apr2021) and early this morning (21Apr2021). She was in excruciating pain. She reported it&#39;s complicated for her to make that mind adjustment. She texted her cousin this morning at 6:30AM (21Apr2021) because she had to let her cousin know what was going on. If her cousin texts and she doesn&#39;t respond, her cousin will do a welfare check. She doesn&#39;t want a welfare check so she told her cousin to just let her sleep, let her see how she feels when she&#39;s up again. She reported sometimes when the Tarlov cysts were bothering her she could lay on her back and it would soothe her pain. This time that was not working. She reported she had her vertebra and her discs and then her outer muscular system to the flank, that is where it was painful. She didn&#39;t know if this is normal. She was hearing normal side effects like tiredness and fatigue, she was not having those because she was not normal. She was 1 in 2 billion with her Tarlov cysts. She has complications with her Tarlov cysts. She has mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. She has Tarlov cysts from Cervical vertebra #5 bilaterally down. She had multiple cysts. She didn&#39;t know if the Covid 19 vaccine was aggravating her back. She reported she has 2 nervous systems, her parasympathetic and her sympathetic nervous system. She reported this is in her parasympathetic nervous system. She reported sensory, if she touches something hot, she knew it was hot. She reported this is so important. She had muscle tenderness and muscle tightness from 20Apr2021and that&#39;s it. She knew what she was taking about because she was using medical terminology. The pain felt like someone kicked her in her kidneys. The kidneys, where the waist is on her back to the top of her sacral area and up the spine to where her first rib is and go outward, that&#39;s where her pain was, from thoracic vertebra 12 to lumbar 5.  The only different thing she&#39;s done was get the Covid 19 vaccine. She was trying to triage herself. She didn&#39;t know what else to do. The Percocet was not even fixing it. She wanted to make sure the Covid 19 vaccine wasn&#39;t exacerbating her disease. She thought that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. She was in a lot of pain. Her pain was the same before and after when she took the Percocet. Normally the Percocet calmed her down to where she&#39;s functional and the Percocet was not. Percocet was 10-325mg, oxycodone and acetaminophen. Take one 4 times daily as needed for pain. The Percocet was a pharmacy bottle. In order for her to have a quality of life she also took Ketorolac or Toradol. She hadn&#39;t taken that today (21Apr2021). She picked her prescriptions up at the same time she received her Covid 19 vaccine.  She can lay on the ground on her back sometimes and her pain will be alleviated. Now laying on her back exacerbates her pain. She didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s muscular. If she was diagnosing herself, she would say it&#39;s not muscular. She knew enough about Tarlov cysts that she knew how to rule it out. She reported her felt feels like it&#39;s punching her lungs.  She reported it&#39;s so hard to explain. She&#39;s trying to separate the pain she has from her Tarlov cysts from what she&#39;s experiencing now. She reported her pain was a 10 plus in both flanks. She stated people will call flanks &#34;the sides&#34;. The only reason she knows it&#39;s a flank is because she had learn anatomy real quick with her Tarlov cysts. On the date of her first Covid 19 vaccine she had a steroid injection and a Toradol injection. With her second Covid 19 vaccine she had a Toradol injection. The pharmacist told her there would be no conflict in receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. she has to suffer through it until her pain subsides. It feels like it&#39;s kicking the heck out of her back. When she lays supine she can alleviate some of the pain associated with the Tarlov cysts but that&#39;s not working.  She can&#39;t stand or lay supine, all of that is out the window. Meaning it&#39;s not working. This pain has to be the Covid 19 vaccine. She&#39;s in a lot of pain and she didn&#39;t need the vaccine to exacerbate her pain. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I was hospitalized for bilateral pulmonary embolism 4/18/2021 at hospital. I think I had symptoms for over 3 weeks prior to hospitalization. I was rapid COVID tested on 3/26/2021 the nurse at CVS asked why my blood oxygen was low. I did not know but had me pant and move my fingers and it went up to 96. I also remember severe leg pain on a drive 3/25/21. I noticed shortness of breath 4/5/21 and fast pulse but didnot go to hospital until 4/18/21. I previously had a PE 7/2009 and also had it for ~2 weeks before going to hospital. I was not on blood thinner since 2015. The doctors at the hospital and primary care doctor did not seem to think the PE was vaccine related but they also do not believe I had symptoms for over 3 weeks.

Her pupils were dilated and slow to react and she was in some respiratory distress and very diaphoretic.  At this point airway was controlled 5 oh endotracheal intubation using the glide scope and during the intubation patient was noted for copious amounts of dark brown vomitus coming from her esophagus which was guaiac positive.  Her blood pressure was low she was sedated initially with propofol etomidate was used for the intubation however because of her hypotension the propofol was slowed and she was given Versed which did seem to control her agitation and maintain her blood pressure.  Patient had IV fluid initiated wide open and CT scan was obtained of head chest abdomen pelvis given the fact that her altered mental status could be from some kind of intracerebral catastrophe and the patient&#39;s abdominal exam being unobtainable certainly possible that her GI bleeding could be from a perforated viscus.  CT scan of the brain does not demonstrate any stroke that appears to be acute however there may be some ischemia present although it may be remote and an MRI will need to be done when the patient is more stable.  CT of the chest abdomen pelvis shows what is likely an aspiration pneumonia on the right as well as a perforated viscus in her abdomen.  Radiology feels is probably somewhere in the right colon terminal ileum.  At this point the patient was given Cipro and Flagyl and that should also aid with her aspiration pneumonia.  Her blood pressure did start to decrease her temperature was noted to be elevated at 101.8.  She was given Tylenol rectally and fluids were allowed to run wide open.  Her blood pressure continued to decline and Levophed was instituted.  Case was discussed in detail with surgery and she will go to the OR immediately.  Her temperature continued to rise and was 104.5 upon transfer to the operating room as blood pressure was 78 systolic ED COURSE: o ED Course Medical decision making  Patient with altered mental status from an unknown cause.

Most of the small intestine and large intestine was affected. o Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, ICG injection for evaluation of perfusion  Indication and Consent  Findings: . Findings: Even after the ICG injection.  There was spotty tissue necrosis from mid jejunum all the way through sigmoid colon.  Most areas were blackened with a foul smell.  There was some highlighted areas secondary to the ICG but not a significant amount that would lend for an anastomosis.  Black ascites was present throughout the abdomen.  Unfortunately after much contemplation there was no surgical intervention.   Procedure  Procedure: Patient was placed in supine position.  Was intubated in the emergency room so, we were able to proceed with resuscitation through our anesthesia team.  Patient&#39;s abdomen was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Proceeded to make a midline incision.  The blood supply in the subcutaneous tissues did not even bleed.  Appeared to be darkened and almost coagulated.  As we entered through the fascia we were able to open the peritoneum between 2 hemostats.  The large rush of free air through from the abdomen.  We then proceeded to open the abdomen for the length of her incision.  This was done with electrocautery.  From here there was a black ascites present within the abdomen.  There was a large amount of dead intestine that we could immediately see.  I worked my way to the ligament of Treitz.  There was no adhesions so this was easily found.  That intestine did appear to be pink.  It lasted for about a foot.  After that area everything was either black or purple in color with a few pink spots in between.  This went all the way down to the terminal ileum where pneumatosis was visualized.  We then looked at the colon from cecum through rectum.  It appeared to be blackened as well.  Not knowing whether all of this intestine was dead or not especially with patient being hypotensive I injected ICG dye approximately 2 cc.  This was to evaluate perfusion.  Unfortunately perfusion was no better than what I could visualize.  I could not even find enough room of the colon or small intestine to make an anastomosis.  Was very hard decision, however, we did not resect any bowel.  I closed the patient&#39;s abdomen.  Patient will be taken to ICU on ventilator.  Discussed with daughter with pastor present.
