                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

                                                Asthma Attack started at 1 pm while seated and attending virtual class. She was under no distress and was not in any way exerting herself. She described the attack as a feeling of someone sitting on her chest and began to hyperventilate. The color drained from her face and her hands felt numb. Her asthma attacks are generally exercise-induced, so this was highly unusual.  She took a dose of albuterol ( 2 puffs with a spacer) and followed her asthma action plan. She laid down and slowed her breathing. 20 minutes later her facial color returned to normal. Two hours later her hands returned to normal. She was disoriented for about 5 hours.

                                                My daughter was given her 2nd COVID shot at approximately 9:00am on 4-16-2021. We waited 30 minutes after the shot. No issues. That evening at approximately 6:00pm, she had a red rash on her upper chest and throat. She stated that she was having a hard time breathing and swallowing. I gave her  a Benadryl tablet and watched her for approximately 15-20 minutes. she continued to feel tightness in her throat and said it burned when she swallowed. She confirmed again that she felt her throat was swelling. I drove her to the closest ER located at. My daughter was seen and it was determined that she was having an allergic reaction. DR recommended continue Benadryl tab every 4 hours for the next 12-24- hours. We were discharged to home. I administered another does of Benadryl at approximately 10:15pm. My daughter went to sleep. I woke her up at 3:00am to check on her and she stated she did not have a rash and her throat was fine. She was running a low grade fever of 100.5. I gave her 500 mg of Tylenol for the fever. When my daughter woke later that morning at approximately 8:30am, she still did not have a rash or throat swelling. Her fever was gone.

                                                Pt. received her second Pfizer dose at 3pm. By 11:30pm she had significant swelling on both of her eyes, mouth, and the start of red splotchy skin on arms and legs. We took her to ER. They gave her 50mg of hydroxizine and sent us home. 5min after leaving the ER at 12:30am on 4/23 she felt a golf ball sized lump in her throat and was having difficulty breathing. We brought her back to the ER.  At this time they gave her an ekg, and at around 1:30am gave her an epi pin and an oral steroid. Within 5min of the oral steroid and epi pin she no longer had difficulty in breathing and the lump in her throat was gone as was the res splotches. By 5am the swelling in her face had reduced drastically to 90% normal in her left eye and 70% normal in her right eye and 70% normal in her lip. She was released from the ER at 5:45am and went home to sleep. At 11:30am on 4/23 her swelling in her face remains the same and she is complaining of a headache. She was given 50mg more of hydroxizine.

                                                An hour after Pfizer vaccine administration, the parents of the 16 year old patient returned to the pharmacy and reported that their daughter was complaining of trouble breathing in the parking lot.  The immunizing tech asked the parents to bring the patient back to the pharmacy.    The patient returned and while crying and gasping for air, she reported that it felt as if someone was constricting her throat.  She also complained of stiff fingers and feeling numbness/tingling in her upper extremities.    Assuming anaphylactic reaction, one dose of epinephrine was administered.  The patient said she felt slightly better after the first dose but then 2 minutes later, said her breathing was getting worse, and again described feeling her throat tightening.  Five minutes later, a 2nd dose of epinephrine was administered.   The patient was taken to the hospital by paramedics.

Patient&#39;s mother stated patient was experiencing extreme anxiety getting the vaccine and after 20 minutes was wheezing.  She brought patient inside and a Pharmacist came to check on her and her mother stated that she has had a reaction to a medication in the past and just needed Benadryl.  Benadryl was given to her and she took it orally.  Her pulse and blood oxygen were measured with a finger pulse oximeter and were both normal.  Shortly after she was panicking more and had a seizure.  Her mother reported that she has frequent seizures when she has anxiety/panic episodes.  Her seizures were persisting so 911 was called.  Paramedics arrived shortly after and took patient to the hospital.  A few hours later the patient&#39;s mother came back to us to inform us that she was released from the hospital and was feeling fine and back to normal.

                                                Arm soreness, tightness in chest, dizziness, nausea, difficulty breathing. Symptoms started pretty much right after getting the shot but the dizziness and tightness in chest stopped after I took a nap about an hour after the shot. As of the submission of the form I am still feeling soreness in my arm but it?s lessened a bit and I still feel nauseous and am having trouble breathing properly.

                                                Five days following her first Pfizer COVID vaccine, she woke up from a dead sleep with sharp chest pain, shortness of breath, and feelings of her throat closing. She was given one dose of oral steroids by PCP, but continued to have the feeling that she couldn&#39;t breathe due to her throat closing throughout the day so she presented to the ED. There, she reported continued chest pain, worsening SOB, and the feeling that she could not breathe. She was tachycardic to 140 bpm, but otherwise vitals were stable. She was admitted and monitored on continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry overnight. By the following day on 4/29, her symptoms had largely resolved and she was discharged.

                                                Patient reported feeling lightheaded status post first dose Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot: EW0167, expiration date: 08/31/2021) to medic. Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety. Client reported she felt anxious prior to her vaccination and that her last oral intake was 15 minutes prior to vaccine. Client denied headache, blurry vision and chest pain. At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures. Client was advised to stay for additional 30 minute observation. Client&#39;s symptoms resolved completely and she was able to ambulate away from observation site without assistance and with a steady gait.

                                                16 yo female came into our injection site today 05/05/21 to receive her first pfizer vaccine. She was accompanied by her father. Pt received vaccine IM to her left deltoid. Pt completed vaccine at 2:55pm at which she sat down for her 15 minute observation period. As soon as she sat down she called over the staff that administered the vaccine. She explained to her that she felt nausea and was breathing heavily. I then walked over to them and the attendee was very pale and breathing heavily. By that time I had RN getting attendees history from her father, She has no history of allergic reactions, not taking any medications and no current illness. She is &#34;slightly asthmatic&#34; but is not taking any rx.  RN was helping me by putting cold pack behind attendees neck. Pt then proceeded to explain that she felt nauseas and starting dry heaving. RN then brought over trash can and attendee started to vomit. I then started to proceed and take her vitals. first set of vitals were taken at 2:58pm BP: 90/60 HR: 132 RR: 24 O2: 100%. Attendee at this point was diaphoretic, pale, breathing heavily and vomiting. We continued to monitor attendee in which she started to feel better by 3:08 pm. She was no longer pale, diaphoretic or vomitting and was breathing normally. We provided attendee with water and continued to monitor her. Now that pt was calm, I was able to ask her some questions. She stated that she had a smoothie and an avocado toast about an hour prior to vaccine. She explained to me that she does have a phobia to needles and was feeling very anxious prior to appointment. I then repeated her vitals at 3:16pm BP: 98/60 HR:89 RR: 20 O2: 99%.  I had attendee stand up off chair and walk at 3:22pm. She felt fine and did not feel dizzy at all. No signs of distress noted. She was then discharged and walked out with her dad at 3:25pm.

                                                My 16-year-old daughter, very healthy without any health conditions, got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday evening, April 10th, at around 5pm. On Wednesday, she started complaining of shortness of breath, chest pains, which she described as a feeling of someone stubbing her heart. By Thursday, she began blacking out repeatedly throughout the day, each blackout lasting about a minute. These progressed and whenever she blacked out, she would not remember what happened. At first, she and I brushed it off as maybe lack of calcium since she rarely drinks milk. But as they intensified, I began to become more concerned. I told her I cannot leave her by herself in the house as I prepared to go pick up her young siblings from school then schedule an appointment with her doctor. On our way back home, she blacked out again, however, it was for more than a minute. Straight away, I drove to the  ER close by. The doctor came back to inform me that her heartbeat was irregular and concerning based on her age. In that same moment, she began complaining of excessive pain like someone punching her heart out, and then she passed out again. Still with my two other children, the whole ordeal began to frighten them and illicit some heavy tears.  Being that this ER was general admission, the doctors insisted they call in the paramedics to transport her to another ER for children. However, after being transported to the other ER, her condition began to intensify rather quickly and the pediatric doctor at the second ER informed us we would have to be transferred to Childrens intensive care unit where the cardiologists could check her heart, find the ultimate cause, and monitor her closely. In that moment, as a mother, I was speechless and extremely terrified. Seeing my daughter being transferred from ER to ER, made it even tougher on me so much that I could no longer hold myself together. Here she was in terrible pain and being moved around with no clear diagnosis and treatment.  From there on, we spent a couple days in the Cardiac ICU waiting and praying with friends for answers and the best treatment she could get to ease the pain. By about the third day of being in the ICU, the cardiologists informed me, she had Acute Myocarditis. This was so shocking in a sense that both sides of the family have no history of heart issues. Secondly, she is a very healthy child.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Last time at the doctors office was for her well check in Oct or Nov. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine.  On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling. They are not sure if it (anaphylactic reaction) is related to the vaccine. She does not have any allergic issues of any kind and is not sure if it is from the vaccine. The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid. She was on steroids for like 4 days. The steroid was prednisone. Outcome of anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing, face swelling were recovered on 21Apr2021.

                                                is a 16-year-old female patient admitted with tachycardia.  Starting 1-1/2 weeks ago, mom notes that she has had episodes where she feels her heart racing.  It began 1-1/2 weeks ago with her crying and her watch that her heart rate was 208.  They went to the ED, where she was given some fluids and her heart rate improved so she was sent home.  She had had prior episodes of mild tachycardia up to the 140s in the past but which has always improved with fluids.  Mom states that she used to have a lot of trouble maintaining her hydration and would not drink a lot of water.  Since the last 1-1/2 weeks, she has been having these episodes 1-2 times a day that last about 1 to 2 minutes with a max of 5 minutes.  When it comes on, she feels dizzy and lightheaded, and after the episode she feels a big rush of blood to her head.  She also has some associated shortness of breath.  She denies having any episodes of chest pain at all.  She has never passed out, she has never felt like she was going to pass out, she has never felt like she was out of balance.  She denies any nausea or vomiting during episodes.  She denies any headaches during the episodes.  She does have history of migraines, but has not had one in the last couple weeks.  Her prior resting heart rate was in the 80s per her watch, and lately it has been in the 110s to 120s while awake in 80s while asleep.  Along with the episodes, she also feels some pulsating sensation in her abdomen.  She does not have any abdominal pain.  Today, her heart rate was again in the 200s, but it was worse than before because it lasted about 30 minutes total.  Lately they have been using an app that continuously monitors her heart rate.  Since these episodes started, she has cut down on her caffeine intake and she has increased her water intake.  Does not feel that this helped. She has never had syncope in the past and has never had seizures in the past.  Patient was started on carvedilol which has helped control heart rate and was encouraged to drink fluids. Per primary care team, her current episode of tachycardia was not due to the vaccine.

                                                Vaccine administered at outside facility. Patient is a 16 yo girl, admitted on 4/19 with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19) after presenting with progressive new onset chest pain. She was in usual state of health up until 2 days ago when she started developing body aches, and chest pain. Patient received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine last week (4/15). No known history of COVID infection. Parents brought her to the ED yesterday after she complained of dizziness, SOB, chest pain, and had a near syncopal event. EKG showed non-specific ST abnormalities with labs showing elevated troponin, mildly elevated CRP, normal CXR, negative COVID PCR. Denies fever, GI symptoms, GU symptoms, headache, rash. Once transferred to our PICU, she was worked up for myocarditis vs MIS-C. Troponin has been trended q6 and is trending up (now 11). Of note, there have been no fevers. Patient is a 16 yo girl, s/p admission (4/19-4/23/21) with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19), has now been readmitted on 5/10 with myocarditis after presenting with headache and neck pain for 2 days. Following discharge from the PICU on 4/23, patient states that symptoms have lingered (low grade fevers, feeling tired, on and off chest pain). After developing a progressive headache and neck pain, she came back to the ER for re-evaluation. Upon readmission, her troponin was elevated (2.06 on 5/10). Her CBC and CMP were reassuring. Blood culture collected on 5/11 and urine culture collected on 5/10. ID consulted for workup.

                                                Shortly after receiving vaccine (about 5 minutes), pt complained about difficulty breathing. I went to check on her and she appeared pale and seemed very drowsy and unresponsive to questions. She continued to complain about dizziness and nausea. Her parents grabbed some water for her and still there was no improvement. I called 911 to report the symptoms and was advised to administer EpiPen. When asked if her breathing improved, she nodded yes, but she did not appear to have improved. She continued to be unresponsive to questions and appeared extremely drowsy. Within 15 minutes, the ambulance arrived.

                                                The patient was previously well then shortly after the first COVID vaccine she began experiencing fatigue slowing to her swim times ( she is an high level swimmer) and felt &#34;Off&#34;. She presented to my office on May 6, 2021 three days after her second COVID vaccine  I examined her and heard a slight hint of a wheeze and in addition to labs did a CXR which was Abnormal with evidence of a LLL consolidation and a pleural effusion.  We then did a CT scan with contrast and started her on antibiotics  and I called Pulmonology to get her in quickly since swimming trials were approaching and we had to do our best to get her in shape to compete.  We also did a rapid COVID test which was negative at my office on May 7, 2021-- The pediatric pulmonologist repeated the CXR 5 days later and there was more fluid and she was now having more sx of cough and feeling  worse so she was Admitted to the Hospital on May 11th and had a Chest tube placed and drained 950 cc of serous fluid .  Pulmonology, oncology and rheumatology consulted to rule out various other causes of the pleural fluid in an otherwise healthy girl.  Surgery  did the procedure and followed up outpt.   She was in the hospital for approximately 4 days.  Proximity of sx onset to doses  and other sources being essentially ruled out lead to concern for vaccine complication.

                                                Patient admitted with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  At the time of the report, she is still hospitalized. From EHR note: Patient was in her usual state of health when she received her second dose of the Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  She experienced mild myalgias in the day following the vaccine.  However, on 6/5 she developed new severe substernal chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnea.  Pain radiated to her throat.  Given severity of pain, she presented to the emergency department.  In the ED she was afebrile, tachycardic, and initially hypertensive.  Labs demonstrated WBC 10.9 (N 49, L 27), Hb 11.7, PLT 315.  ESR 25, CRP 7.61.  Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.08, consistent with mild cardiac inflammation.  SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were negative. An EKG was normal. However, an echo demonstrated low-normal LVEF (55%).  Otherwise, patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, new rashes, arthralgias. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring.  Following admission, she was started on ibuprofen.  She notes that her substernal chest pain has improved somewhat since admission.  Differential for patient&#39;s presentation includes infectious, post-infectious, and non-infectious causes of myocarditis. Although post-vaccination mild myocarditis seems likely, we agree with the infectious workup already undertaken, and recommend additional EBV and CMV PCR testing.

                                                Pain in her chest, lungs, and ribs; Costochondritis; Myalgia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient&#39;s father). This is one of the 2 reports from same patient. A 16-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient received first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date in 2021, 3 weeks before the second dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma (Diagnosed when she was 5 years old), allergies (Pollen, dust, walnuts, coconut, diagnosed when she was 3 years old) and migraine from Sep2019. Concomitant medications included Amitriptyline 25 mg for migraine, Macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) daily for constipation and salbutamol sulfate (VENTOLIN HFA) asthma pump taken as needed for asthma which patient had not used this for a while before the vaccine. The patient received the second dose and then 5 days later she had to be taken to the emergency room. The patient was only 16 years old but was able to be vaccinated because she had asthma, so she is high risk. In Mar2021, 5 days after the second dose, the patient had horrible pain in her chest, lungs, and ribs. On 26Mar2021 or 27Mar2021 the patient woke up with this pain, then that night it hurt when the patient breathed or talked. The patient was taken to the emergency room at that time and was diagnosed with costochondritis, the patient was not ever admitted to the hospital. The patient was given ibuprofen 600 mg prescribed but it didn&#39;t help. Unknown lot, NDC, and expiration date for the Ibuprofen. The pain was still there so the patient was given naproxen and she has been taking that for almost 2 months now. Sometimes the pain gets better but sometimes it gets worse. Unknown lot, NDC, and expiration date for the Naproxen. The first 4 weeks the patient had to lay down because she couldn&#39;t sit or stand for more than 15 minutes because of the pain. The patient was fine and then 5 days after the second dose she got the pain, and it doesn&#39;t go away. The pain is under the breast like 4 fingers under it and in the middle near the sternum. The pain hurts more when the patient moves and changes positions. It was reported that &#34;Two days ago, the pain was a 2 out of 10, but randomly it goes to 5,6, or 7. Today the pain is a 4 out of 10&#34;. The caller said this event was ongoing and persisting. When the patient went to the emergency room on 26Mar2021 or 27Mar2021 they checked her for inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis, but it was negative. The patient&#39;s blood work was normal, the chest x-rays were normal too. The patient also went to the emergency room on 05May2021 and was not admitted. The care team checked the patient again and they said it was myalgia or something. The patient was not resolved from the events. The causality assessment with suspect vaccine reported as Related to the events pain in her chest, lungs, and ribs.   Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported Pulmonary pain, Costochondritis and Myalgia.

                                                I started to feel a slight pressure on the right side of my throat around 1:30 hours after the vaccine was administered. The pressure was drastic, but it slightly relieved after about two minutes. I took 2 benadryl and kept feeling pressure, although it was lessened. After about 2 more hours I took 6 medrol pack 4mg tablets to see if the symptoms alleviated. Around 30 minutes after I took the medrol pack, I felt the same pressure, but on the left side of my neck, and it lessened  after 1 minute.  I still feel some pressure on the left side of my neck 10 hours after the vaccine was administered. I all took 1,000 mg of Acetaminophen 1 hour after the vaccine was administered to relieve some pain that I was feeling in the vaccination site.

                                                Patient not seen in office.  History obtained via phone from father of patient and patient herself.  Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

                                                After a few minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported dizziness, light headedness, and blurry/dots in vision. She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

RN asked if she was okay, stated she was scared and that her arms felt weird and her chest was tight.  RN asked some questions about her health history, she then offered a granola bar and water. Client drank some water, declined snack. Clients hand began to shake, RN offered to lay client on a cot but client declined. Her dad came to check on her, she broke down saying that her arms were numb and chest was tight. The 15 vaccine minute timer went off, client stood but legs were week. She sat down and then slid herself onto the floor. She at first went into a fetal position then laid out flat on the floor. Client began acting more panicked and frantic with short quick breaths and her hands appeared to be contracting some. Clinic team made the decision to call 911 and administer 0.50 mg epinephrine. Ambulance arrived quickly and client was taken to the Medical Center via ambulance.

The patient was given cold water to hold on her neck and was alert.  Local EMS assessed she was ok and the patient&#39;s mother refused transport to the ED.  The patient left on her own.

On Wednesday, May 19the she woke up and said that she had a terrible time in the middle of the night with a tight chest and she couldn&#39;t catch her breath. She wouldn&#39;t go to Urgent Care with me so I told her that we had to call the 24 hour nurse line (on the back of the insurance card). I called and she spoke with a nurse, then spoke with a doctor on the phone who told her to go the doctor if her symptoms got any worse.

                                                Chest Pains Shortness of Breath Costochondritis - Per the Doctor These conditions were present after the first vaccine shot on April 6th and then again after the second shot on April 27th. Doctor initially thought it could be a simple case of Acid Reflux and gave her Nexium. Once that didn&#39;t work, she had her Chest X Ray done that came back all clear. She then had her blood tests done and that too came all clear except for Vitamin D3 that came in at 15 so doctor gave her a 50,000 unit Vitamin D3 dose. That also didn&#39;t do much to relieve the chest pains and shortness of breath so he had her EKG and Echo done and those were all clear as well. Finally, he gave her a  day steroid course of Prednisone at 40 mg/day which is where  she is currently. It is helping her a bit but she is still complaining of original two issues - chest pain and shortness of breath. She is also doing cold and warm compressions throughout the day that helps her temporarily.

After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

He is an athlete and not able to do any of the sports  - he starts breathing heavily when he walks across the room. He couldn&#39;t attend school for over a month. Has been to several physicians - a pulmonologist several times; cardiologist; gastroenterologist; his pediatrician. He got a steroid shot - 24th,  given to him for the headaches. Last Monday, the 24th of May (the pulmonologist gave this to him).  It (the headaches pain) was really bad on Tuesday, Wed, Thursday and he started feeling better with the headaches on Friday. He has been given an inhaler and Pepcid for acid reflux (gastroenterologist). These have given him a little relief - but he don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the steroid shot or the inhaler that is helping. Yesterday he tried to go to his Sports class and he couldn&#39;t do it - there was a problem with breathing; a lot of shortness of breath. The headaches and the breathing issues are still what are debilitating him the most.

                                                Patient told us that she has passed out and vomited after receiving vaccines in the past. After getting the vaccine, she didn&#39;t feel well. We monitored her in the vaccine room for about 5 minutes. She had a drink of water, then when she was ready, her family helped her into the lobby I returned to the pharmacy, and continued to watch her. The patient&#39;s mom came to the window and said patient had fainted. I went to her, and said we need to lower her to the floor. At that point, mom said patient was not breathing I quickly lowered her to the floor, while dad supported her head. I didn&#39;t have time to verify that she wasn&#39;t breathing, because as soon as she touched the floor, she began convulsing, then sat up and w was immediately awake. She sat up, and we explained that she had passed out and I had her lie down. I stayed with her for a few minutes, asking if they wanted an ambulance (which mom and dad declined) while making sure she was ok. She was just resting at this point, so I returned to the pharmacy, and ask them to let me know if anything changed I continued to watch her from the pharmacy window, and the patient said she was nauseated. We gave mom a bag, and patient vomited in the bag. After a couple more minutes, she seemed to be recovering, and mom and dad helped her out of the store. I followed up with mom at 4:15pm, and mom said patient was still nauseated and had vomited a couple more times. I followed up one last time at 4:45pm, and patient was feeling a bit better, but mom was going to keep an eye on her I recommended that mom take her to a doctor to be evaluated, but mom said she would just keep an eye on her through the night. I told mom that I would follow up again in the morning.

                                                throat tightness; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at a single dose in the left deltoid muscle for COVID 19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient denied any history of previous adverse reactions to vaccines and denied reaction to her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) for COVID 19 vaccination on an unspecified date. The patient was seen at a COVID vaccine clinic today for her second dose of the COVID 19 vaccination. She was given the Pfizer vaccination in the left deltoid muscle. During her 15-minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience throat tightness on Jan2021. Treatment included: Benadryl 25mg po (orally) and Solumedrol 125mg IM. The event did not result in death, not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, did not cause congenital anomaly/birth defect. The outcome of the event was unknown.     No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch has been obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of throat tightness cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. Sever allergic reaction is the known risk for the product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies.

The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

Patient could breathe more deeply after the epi pen administered.  One pharmacist stayed with her in case another dose of epinephrine needed to be administered, once the paramedics arrived the pharmacist left the room so they could care for the patient.

Approximately 10-15 minutes later, father came to the window to report patient&#39;s throat feels tight and closing and patient is getting flushed. I verified with patient if she can breathe, and she stated she could only breathe through her nose, and her throat is tight and closing. I went out of the pharmacy and administered the EpiPen dose on outer left thigh as the other pharmacist was calling 911. The mother arrived at the pharmacy and stated to us she is an ER nurse and told us to cancel the 911 response as she would take the patient to ER immediately. Patient was given the vaccination card and mother took patient away to go to ER, as patient could still walk. The patient appeared stable.

She also experienced shooting pains and tingling in the same arm she received the vaccination. At work, it hurts when she carries things and has dropped items, which is unusual. Pain is mainly in the shoulder, but sometimes in the forearm. She has tried Tylenol, ice and naproxen with no relief. She received methylprednisolone on 4/12, and now feels that she is having an allergic reaction.  Complaints of increased wheezing, shortness of breath and swelling of her skin, she has used her albuterol inhaler at home which has provided no relief.   On 4/13 she received albuterol by nebulizer and an IV dose of methylprednisolone at the emergency department. She is going to start albuterol nebulizer at home, continue OTC antihistamine, discontinue the methyprednisolone and start prednisone tomorrow.

                                                At 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient had noted a dry, scratchy feeling in her throat and asked if I (mom) had brought a water bottle with us (I had not).  At 20 minutes post-vaccination, patient began feeling her throat tightening, tongue swelling, and stated that her lips/mouth/tongue had a tingling sensation. At this point she was taken to the nurse/paramedic to be monitored with EKG, pulse oximetry, and given a bottle of water to drink. After 30 minutes of monitoring, the nurse/paramedic asked patient if her symptoms were improving and if she felt well enough to go home.  She said that her symptoms were not gone, but improving, so she was told to sign a waiver/refusal of care form and released. However, at 11 hours post vaccination (1:30 AM), the symptoms returned (tongue swelling, throat tightening, tingling sensation in and around her mouth).  I administered Benadryl (2 tablets), monitored for 30 minutes, and symptoms improved.   No further symptoms after that point.

The symptoms worsened approximately 24 hours after to where it has and continues to be sharp shooting and constant pain in my heart that travels into my left arm. Simple things like walking and breathing make it extremely painful.

A 18-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 07Apr2021 13:30, as 1st dose, single dose and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0171; Expiration Date: was not reported ) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 12:30, as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 2015 and ongoing. Additional Information for Other Conditions: states was in remission for 6 years prior to her second dose of the vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that she had a pretty severe reaction to her second dose of BNT162B2. States she has been in the hospital for 5 days last week and has now been in the hospital for 4 days this week because of side effects from vaccine that she received on 28Apr2021 which was her second dose. She thought the side effects would go away after the first hospitalization but was readmitted. First admitted to the hospital on 01May2021 for severe reaction to the shot for 5 days then was sent home because they thought the side effects would go away but the side effects have still been heavy. She was admitted again on Friday (14May2021) to the hospital from the side effects that are continuing. States she had lost 14 pounds from the time she was home from her first visit to the hospital. Patient vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down: States that right after she got the second shot a couple of hours later she vomited a lot and couldn&#39;t hold food or water down which started 28Apr2021 and that she hasn&#39;t thrown up since Friday 14May2021, but has improved. She was starting to recover from it, it was just starting to get better. The really bad diarrhea started on the 28Apr2021 and was ongoing. The doctor thinks the second dose of the vaccine caused an ulcerative colitis flare up. She noticed the tachycardia on 29Apr2021. States her resting heart rate before the vaccine was 55 on average and now her resting rate was 105-115, and when she gets up to walk around it was 140-160. States that this was what was preventing her to be able to leave the hospital now. Tachycardia was the reason for admission for the first hospitalization. she was at urgent care she was tachycardic and her throat and glands were all swollen and they thought she needed to be admitted to the hospital. Swollen glands recovered last week, either 12 or 13May2021 and was completely recovered from that. Clarifies throat and swollen glands recovered 13May2021. Her dates of admission were 01May2021- 04May2021 for tachycardia. States she was currently at hospital and was admitted 14May2021 and was still there today for tachycardia and weight loss. States the tachycardia warranted both hospital admissions but the weight loss also contributed to the second admission as well. States her current weight was 116 after losing 14 pounds. She was weighed on the 4th when discharged from her first hospital admission and she weighed 130 pounds or 59 kilograms then had a follow up appointment with her cardiologist on the 14th for tachycardia and was weighed then and was 116 pounds at that time. They then sent her to the emergency room right after that follow up appointment to be admitted. States she hasn&#39;t been weighed again during this hospital admission so she thinks her weight was the same. She coughed and said sorry something got stuck in her throat, then continued her conversation. Ulcerative Colitis flare up- states she was unsure of when it transitioned from diarrhea to this flare up of ulcerative colitis. States she has just starting getting steroids and they increased her normal medications for her condition and was starting to improve. States she has a picture of her vaccine card and the events started after her 2nd dose. They did a procedure to confirm it was flare up at around 15:00 on 17May2021, performed a sigmoidoscopy and just found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as results which was similar to the ulcerative colitis flare up. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: 55, heart rate: 105-115, heart rate: 140-160 on an unspecified date, sigmoidoscopy: found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as r on 17May2021. The outcome of the ulcerative colitis flare up was recovering, for event tachycardia, diarrhea and on 29Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered , lost 14 pounds was not recovered, and for vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down was unknown and for events throat and glands swollen was recovered on 13May2021.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

One of the nurses at the site, gave me several doses of Benadryl and a Zyrtec. I was there 45 minutes - I kept getting more and more hives and my throat was getting itchy and my breathing was off a little bit. After taking the Benadryl, it started slowing down eventually and I was able to leave in 45 to fifty minutes. My primary care physician told me to take Benadryl before and after getting the second round of the vaccine. I had hives and a small rash on my chest for three days and I had to take Benadryl for those days. I t was extremely itchy. Symptoms resolved by end of day three.  There was also a slight tingling in my fingers  while I was experiencing the rash.

                                                When I first got the vaccine, i got dizzy and sick to my stomach with a headache. I decided to leave after sitting for 20 minutes and go back to work because it got a little better. on tuesday.   A few hours later, my chest started to ache and my throat started to hurt. thinking I had asthma due to the heat, i ignored it and used my inhaler.   By the next day, I was coughing and it hurt worse. I was still dizzy but worse, felt neasious and had a headache. I used my inhaler twice with no help. My arm started to hurt to move, and my injection spot became a red lump.   By Thursday, I could barely take a normal breath. It hurt to walk, talk, yawn, sneeze or anything that lifted my need to breathe above bare minimum. It hurt greatly and I couldn&#39;t take a full breath. I felt like my lungs were swollen and my throat hurt to swallow. I was very dizzy and had horrible nausea.

                                                I Received the shot at 10:45am on April the 15th, no side effects except arm soreness afterward. Then at around 7:40pm that same night, I began getting terrible itchy on my face, back, arms, and neck. It worsened and I started having trouble breathing (it felt like my throat had tightened)/a hoarse voice, and my pulse was faster than usual and I felt woozy and tired.. I called a nurse hotline and she recommended for me to be seen at an ER, and I went home to tell my parents and they called a doctor friend, and I was told to take Benadryl and if anything got worse to go to the ER. The next day when I woke up I felt mainly tired and had a slight cough and was scheduled a telehealth appointment, and I am taking Zyrtec 10mg and Pepsin 20mg daily x one week with Benadryl as a back up in case the symptoms flare up, and am advised to go to the ER if the breathing issues return. In terms of symptoms now, I am just a little itchy.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 19-year-old female patient (not pregnant at event onset and time of vaccination) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 11Feb2021 at 00:00 (19-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Ewing Sarcoma which was not ongoing (Diagnosed at 5 years old, treated with chemotherapy for 1 year, cancer free for 13 years). There were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included low dose ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (TRI-SPRINTEC) and montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR). No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 20Jan2021 at 00:00 (19-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Starting 15Feb2021 at 12:00, the patient began to have shortness of breath that got progressively worse throughout the week. On 22Feb2021, she woke up with severe shortness of breath and her O2 saturation was 82%. She went to the hospital emergency department and was given a chest CT, and diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolisms. She also had severe right ventricular strain due to the PEs. She was rushed into an EKOS procedure and a IVC filter was also put in. Adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization (4 days), and Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). COVID test (test type: Nasal Swab, test name: Novel Coronavirus PCR) post vaccination was Negative on 22Feb2021, and Negative on 29Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included Heparin drip, EKOS and IVC filter procedure. The outcome of the events was recovering. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient slumped into chair in the observation area. I rushed to her. She was hyperventilating, but not wheezing or making any high pitched sound while breathing. Patient was conscious, and could answer my questions coherently. Patient was told to take off her mask so she can breath more easily. Patient kept saying &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and was told there&#39;s nothing to feel sorry for, and we wanted to make sure she was fine. Pulse was slightly elevated. Hands were warm and sweaty. Patient asked for a bottle of water. After drinking some water she felt better. It was likely a panic attack episode. I checked on her five minutes later. She just finished talking on the phone with a family or friend. She was a lot better at this point. She agreed that that was likely a panic attack. I advised her she should be able to receive the 2nd dose later, but should consult her PCP.

                                                At 7:40 pm on 04/27 I received my second Pfizer COVID19 shot. I felt okay for the rest of the night and went to bed around 2am that night. The next day, I woke up around 10:30am and was sore until about 12pm when I began to feel completely awful. I was tired and no pain reliever helped with the muscle aches in my shoulders and back. I felt like my chest was being weighed down and it felt like a horrible chore to even breathe. About 24 hours after the shot, under my jaws began to hurt terribly and ice didn&#39;t do much to help it. I finally fell asleep on 04/28 around 2am and woke up on 04/29 without any pain.

                                                Pfizer COVID vaccine administered 04/27/21. Reports that she started feeling unwell almost immediately after injection.  Immediate Reaction (onset &lt;5 min) associated with the following symptoms:  ? Visible swelling and pain at the injection site  ? Increased nasal secretions and eye tearing ? Chills Around 30 minutes after, she had also developed: ? Swelling of the tongue (felt &#34;heavy&#34;) ? Flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea, followed later by vomiting ? Dizziness/lightheadedness/weakness ? Dyspnea, wheezing, and cough ? Hives on arms and chest    No throat tightening or tachypnea. She did not attempt speech.  No one in the clinic took her blood pressure or pulse ox   The patient brought her epi pen with her but elected not to use it. Left after 30 minute observation period.  Thinks that the people at the vaccine clinic did not recognize that she had hives because of her dark complexion.  The people administering vaccines were not medically trained    Patient&#39;s mom recognized that she was not feeling well when she picked her up.  She took benadryl which helped with allergy symptoms.  She then developed fever up to 102.3, chills, headache, nausea, and myalgias x 5 days

                                                Patient reported symptoms of: tachycardia, shakiness, vision changes, tongue numbness and shortness of breath following the first dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine on 2/5/2021. Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

                                                Part one: Within one minute of injection, I was extremely dizzy and had to force myself to breathe. My hearing became muffled and I couldn&#39;t hear. I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

Thursday morning, I started to feel extremely sluggish and I struggled to catch my breath.  1-10 (10 being severe) I would rank this at a 5. Friday morning is when I really felt like an 8 and my listed symptoms weighed me down. I would define these symptoms as episodes. Each episode would last a couple of minutes and I would return to my normal state. I felt an 8 till the following Sunday/ Monday. Tuesday, felt a little better.

After about an hour and a half, tongue went numb and throat did not get better, and was still tight and closing. Gave me prednisone and Benadryl and took albuterol inhaler that opened throat and that helped open throat and Benadryl helped with the scratchiness.

Her condition of shaking got worse over period of time and she complained about shortness of breath and she was gasping for air .

After5-10 minutes later, she complained about numbness on her extremities and tingling sensation on her finger and she still experiencing tremors.  We had to call the ambulance and they arrived within 5-7 minutes.

On 5/21/21 at 1723, the patient reported to our urgent care facility with a chief complaint of chest tightness (hurts when laying down), difficulty breathing, and nausea since the evening of 5/20/21. Given a recent Nexplanon insertion the day prior (5/20/21), the provider had a concern for possible PE so the patient was referred to the Emergency Department.  The patient arrived at the ED and was seen by the provider on 5/22/21 at 0416.  The patient continued to report chest discomfort as a heaviness, squeezing, ache.  The pain was constant and worse upon taking a deep breath.  Following a review of labs, EKG, Troponin, physical exam, the ED provider diagnoses &#39;chest wall pain&#39; and the patient was discharged home with instructions to f/u as an outpatient for any ongoing symptoms.  No additional chart documentation as of this report date (5/25/21).

A 20-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot number: EW0191; Expiration Date: Sep2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Left arm on 22May2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 20-years) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux in the stomach; was diagnosed about one or two years ago. The patient did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the administration of suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing Tri-lo-sprintec (started taking it to regulate her cycle as she had an irregular period; she started this birth control 2 or 3 years ago). On 22May2021, the patient waited 15 minutes after the shot and felt fine, but later on that day (a couple of hours after) she got chills (about three hours after the vaccine). She stated she had normal side effects and did not think anything of it. On Sunday (23May2021), she had difficulty breathing (trouble breathing) and felt weak (feeling very weak and has no energy). She voiced it&#39;s hard for her to wear a mask. When she had to put a mask on it really felt like she could not breathe, and the air feels stuffy especially if she wears a mask; every couple of seconds she had to wear the mask under her nose because she could not breathe. Caller stated that she did not have this problem before receiving the COVID vaccine. On Monday (24May2021), she felt like she was coming down with a cold. Caller stated that she thought that might be her trouble breathing was from her cold-like symptoms, but she does not think it was, because she was not experiencing any cold-like symptoms on Sunday and was only having trouble breathing. She experienced coughing, sneezing, itching eyes/nose, chills, and headache. On Wednesday (26May2021), she started feeling nauseated (got very nauseous), not feeling good, she was getting a headache and had caught a cold. Caller stated she did not know if it was from vaccine shot but her eyes got itchy, her nose got itchy, and she kept sneezing and coughing. Yesterday (26May2021), the chills went away, she has not had any chills today, but she does not know if she will have any from this point on. She believed that she has recovered with lasting effects. Caller stated that not feeling well was ongoing and persisting, but then stated that she feels it was worsening. Yesterday, she just felt nauseous, today she woke up with her stomach hurting very badly and abdominal pain; her weakness has continued. Yesterday she took pantoprazole for the abdominal pain and Tylenol for the pain and headache. She stated that she had a slight headache that is now coming and going, clarifies that it is persisting. Caller thought the reason that her stomach is hurting was because of her stomach acid problem. She deals with a strict diet that she must follow for things she was not supposed to have. Since she had the COVID shot, she believes it was affecting the acid problems in her stomach. Caller clarified that she was calling to see what she should do, if she should go see a doctor or if this is normal. The outcome of events Dyspnoea, Asthenia, Sneezing, Headache, stomach hurting, Itchy was not resolved. The outcome of events of Nausea, started not feeling good, Cold like symptoms was resolving. The outcome of events chills was resolved with sequel on 26May2021, and Cough resolved with sequel on 25May2021. The outcome of Abdominal pain was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                Patient experienced syncope after administration of her first COVID vaccine. Her mother is a physician and was present, providing care for her by fanning, comforting and helping her to lie down on the floor next to the waiting chairs. The patient did not faint. She did experience what appeared to be heavy breathing and light-headedness. We provided an ice pack from the immunization cart. The mother stated that the patient experiences this reaction every time she receives a vaccine due to her fear of needles. After about 30 minutes the patient was up and smiling. The family was thankful for our concern and help.

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

Right after getting the vaccine she experienced her throat tightening - stated she felt off- was shaky, lightheaded and heart racing. She came to the observation station- while sitting for observation she felt she wanted to get away from everyone else and came to the check in desk. Her symptoms started to subside when I escorted her to the recliner.  I gave her some Gatorade   bP 90/60 pulse 80.  She was feeling less anxious   O2 sat done at 11:51 99 % she stated she was feeling fine .  repeat BP 104/60 p 60 at noon.  I checked with lead at the clinic who agreed she should stay till 12:10 She felt fine when she left this nurse discussed the plan if she needed help would be to go to urgent care or call police if it was urgent.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

I then went to the ER and got epipen intramusclarly in the ambulance. At the hospital I got steroids and an IV bag. Around 3:30 I started to feel normal again. I stayed under observation for 4 hours. THen got discharged with a prescription of steroids.

I continued to monitor the patient and took her blood pressure (128/77, HR 80). Over the next 2 minutes, she then complained that her throat was sore and started to feel tight. At that time, I informed that patient that I was going to administer a dose of Epinephrine. She was responsive and understood. I called for medical attention and the paramedics arrived to take over patient&#39;s care.

                                                Saturday morning, the arm felt sore - I did notice a little red spot. I felt fatigue and a slight headache. Saturday night  to Sunday morning , the spot got bigger (on the injection site). I drew a circle around it. It got a little bigger on Sunday. They other symptoms subsided at the end of Sunday.  The redness didn&#39;t seem to be going away on the injection site. On Monday, I just had the red arm and it hurt pretty bad to touch. It was tender and warm to the touch. I was at work and I felt shortness of breath just walking down the hall. I took my pulse while I was standing still and it was about 120. Near the afternoon, I was instructed to go to URGENT CARE to get it checked out. Closer to the afternoon, I started noticing that the heartrate  (on my watch) it got to 164. I went to URGENT CARE and they stated it was a normal reaction to vaccine but because of my tachycardia they wanted to send me to Hospital ER. At ER they weren&#39;t worried about injection site (still pretty painful) they were worried about how fast my heartrate was going. The wanted me. The injection site and the tachycardia was back to normal.

                                                4 days after first shot, she called me complaining of bad back pain. She was going to her family doctor the next day for her 21 yr old well visit and was going to get it checked out then. She had a complete physical and was cleared even her lungs were clear and she was good. Tuesday night April 13th at  10pm, she told me she had &#34;air bubbles&#34; in her chest. I said you mean indigestion, take tums I said. She said not mom, actual air bubbles and they are popping in my chest. I said you just got your physical, you are fine. They Thursday night April 15th she started having difficulty breathing and was out of breath. She went to urgent care on April 16th because she felt awful and they saw in an X-ray that she had a &#34;cyst&#34; in her upper right part of her lung and her lung was about to collapse. Sent her home on bed rest with a stereos and 2 inhalers. We got her Friday night from college because the pain in her back and now her chest was worse. Took her to ER and she had a collared lung and pneuomothroax. She was admitted to the hospital and they tried to see if the lung would heal itself.  It did not. They had to do surgery to repair the hole. When they were in there they saw a cobblestone texture where the hole was an they removed that texture and repaired the hole. She has never had a lung issue. Ever. She is also the 3rd person in my family to have had an adverse reaction to the shot. 6 of us vaccinated and 3 with injuries.

                                                4 hours after receiving my Pfizer COVID vaccination, my chest started to tighten up and I became short of breath. I took some Ibuprofen, but the pain is still there today, and it is hard for me to even walk up the stairs without becoming short of breath or being in pain.

Tried steam and heating pad, little improvement  - Jan. 26th Took ProAir inhaler at 2pm before shift     - Little improvement     - Pain still in chest - Called my primary Dr. at 4:30     - Prescribed prednisone and Advair     - Thinks vaccine caused inflammatory response  - Took prednisone at 8pm - Took Advair around 11 - Took ProAir inhaler around midnight  - Heart racing (HR130) - SOB, pain when breathing  - Localized to sternum, on either side as if something was grabbing my lungs and squeezing  - Feel like lightning coursing thru my veins - Shaky  I ended the up in the ER Jan. 26th.  * I took prednisone at 8pm * I took Advair at 11pm * I was still having trouble breathing and my last hit of my ProAir had completely worn off * I took my ProAir around midnight  * Over the course of the next two hours I was SOB, tachy (HR 130s), hot and cold flashes, pain while breathing, couldn?t catch my breath * My friends took me to the ER around 2am * At the hospital they did a 12 Lead EKG, blood work, labs, 2 chest X-rays, and a COVID-test * They gave me 0.5 mg lorazepam IV  * All of my blood work and labs came back normal.  * X-rays came back clear * EKG came back fine * Negative COVID test * I took a nap after the lorazepam hit and woke up feeling much better * ER doc thinks my ProAir exacerbated some anxiety because my lungs were clear and no wheezing  * Discharged me with a script for lorazepam PRN x10 and instructions to follow up with my primary is back at home.  * Doc said I could continue the prednisone and Advair  * Woke up today and yesterday feeling better, still some pain when breathing and exhausted. Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine around 12:30 pm. At around 4:00 pm, I noticed that my lips were slightly swollen. I went and bought liquid Benadryl. At around 5:45 pm, I took 20ml of the liquid Benadryl. I proceeded to sleep the rest of the night. I woke up around 8:20 am the next morning and noticed that my lips were significantly more swollen. I took 20ml more of the liquid Benadryl and noticed that my tongue was a little swollen as well. At around 9:40 am, I took 20ml more of liquid Benadryl.  I noticed no change in my swelling and my throat started to feel like there was a lump. At around 10:20 am,  I drove to the emergency room. The doctor noticed swelling in my lips and some in my tongue and throat. I was given cimetidine and methylprednisolone through an IV, which reduced the swelling. I was discharged 2 hours later after the swelling went down and was given 2 prescriptions to take the next 4 days, which were prednisone 20mg  (three tablets once a day) and famotidine 20mg (twice a day). There is some swelling in my lips in the morning (for the last two days) until I take the steroids, then it reduces the swelling. The overall cost of the emergency room visit was $1669.17.

                                                Immediately after injection I had  itching down my right arm and three bright red stripes underneath injection site appeared. In the following 10 to 15 minutes my lips started tingling and my throat started to tighten up. The itching finally stopped after 10 minutes. The tingling in my lips and throat tightening occurred with both the first and second dose. The staff kept me for around 45-50 minutes for both doses of the vaccine.  When going home I took 2 Benadryl.

                                                Wednesday during the day I noticed a scratchy feeling towards the back of my tongue that I thought was seasonal allergies. Then in the evening, the feeling was more significant and I noticed red bumps on the back of my tongue and inflammation around that area. Woke up Thursday (today) morning with a sore/tender throat and the throat is red and imflamed.

                                                Arrived at pharmacy for 1:15 PM vaccine appointment. 10 minutes after vaccine injection, I could not swallow. Throat started to close and feel tight like I could not breathe. Tongue swelled and could not feel tongue while biting down. Chest compression on center chest. Around 1:30 PM I told sister to get a nurse and the nurse said due to my allergic reaction I needed to do the EpiPen.  She administered properly in my thigh. About 1:35 PM, symptoms started to go away. Stayed until 1:45 PM and when I left I told the nurse I was leaving. Took 2 Benadryl pills in my car with water.

Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

Got her in vaccination room and got 2 Benadryl from Emergency Bag down her - pt was able to talk but her wheezing was getting progressively worse so we called her emergency person (because she wanted to take herself to ER) to take her and let them know what was happening then I called 911 because even I could tell it was getting worse (Pt was reluctant to take an EpiPen - wanted to wait til it was worse) Dispatch highly recommended EpiPen and since I felt it was getting worse also I gave an EpiPen from Emergency Bag as well. Within 5 minutes pt was clearly doing better. Kept her in room just to stave off gawkers since we had 5 other shots waiting in waiting room - took ambulance about 15 minutes to arrive ...  but that gave pt mom time to get to the store and accompany pt to ER with ambulance.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

                                                Throat closing; Shortness of breath; Swollen throat; Dizziness/ Lightheaded; Wheezing; Allergic reaction; had a combination of allergies specially to PEG in the vaccine; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 22-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, LOT number: EW0151, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 04Apr2021 07:30 AM (reported as 06:30 or 07:30, probably 07:30) at age of 22-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) from Jan2021 and gastro stuff. Patient was previously diagnosed with tachycardia, but this was a misdiagnosis. She had a cardiac implant, but they couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong, so her daughter saw a new cardio, and she has been good. Patient was previously had a reaction to Miralax. Concomitant medications included metoprolol tartrate which was taken for several years for POTS, lorazepam (ATIVAN) for panic attacks (started taking 2-3 years ago, maybe 1.5 years ago, when she went off to college, caller clarified it was 2 years ago), escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) for panic disorder and anxiety (started about two years ago and was off for about a month). There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller stated the patient had a reaction to the first shot of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She had a severe reaction. Patient had a combination of allergies specially to PEG in the vaccine. Patient spent the entire day in urgent care. She had a swollen throat and dizziness right after receiving the vaccine (04Apr2021). She was wheezing and lightheaded. Patient was given an ep-pen and Benadryl. It took a while to bring it down. Patient had Pfizer&#39;s COVID 19 vaccine on 04APR2021, and had an immediate allergic reaction including throat closing, wheezing, shortness of breath, dizziness, with the first shot, so caller needed to call to report it, caller&#39;s cousin is a pharmacist, and said to call. Patient was not taken to the hospital, caller ended up taking the patient to urgent care, they had talked patient out of it, and the doctor was livid, patient&#39;s doctor was working at the site that morning. Caller stated she is a busy worker, and today is the first day she is getting to this, and getting things squared away. She knew her daughter has a 60-day window to decide if she was going to get the second, and she wanted to get it, but the reaction was horrible, it was in her daughter&#39;s best interest, they were talking at the hospital, and caller needed to talk to someone to figure it out. Patient&#39;s doctor didn&#39;t know. Caller&#39;s cousin is a pharmacist and talked to them and said, because caller stated her daughter had had a reaction to Miralax, too and her cousin said that has PEG, which her cousin said was what Moderna and Pfizer have, so caller didn&#39;t know. Her daughter ended up going to urgent care, stayed there, and was calmer, her vitals settled after the Epi Pen, and caller understood it is the protocol with Epi Pen, that she has to be monitored medically, so patient was monitored at Urgent Care until 1PM, and her daughter was like, it wore her out, so that was the response. Her daughter has recovered completely, but it took a few days, to go back to herself, patient has a cardiac condition, POTS, and gastro stuff, and caller was trying to get her medical stuff squared away, and this definitely didn&#39;t help. Caller stated they would be trying to wean her daughter off Metoprolol. caller stated it&#39;s Ivabradine, but her daughter has not started it yet, since it has side effects with vision, so her daughter was waiting to go to the eye doctor to take that, so she was taking Metoprolol. Lexapro was stopped trying to get ready for this heart medicine, so they were waiting to figure out all this, before they start that. No further details provided. Caller read from paperwork, which said allergic reaction NOS, drug reaction allergic. Then there was cardio stuff, then it said Cardiac monitoring, oximetry, CBC with automated differential; Hcg beta qualitative urine, IV saline lock. When asked for results, caller said she saw results, but that must be where it&#39;s connected with another hospital. Stated she can fax the results. It was reported that patient had a follow up at doctor&#39;s office for the events. Event throat closing was reported as serious as medically significant. Onset date of the events was 04Apr2021. Outcome of the events was recovered.  Report 1 of 2. Caller was provided with phone number and hours of operation prior to cold transfer onto the line, due to a high call volume, to wait for the next available agent.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I would suddenly feel like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen even though I was breathing deeply and then need to lie down so I didn&#39;t pass out. This happened about 4 times per day lasting about 20 minutes each episode. Not exercising or doing anything out of the ordinary at time of onset. I haven&#39;t noticed these symptoms today, so it might be over.

                                                I have been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy ever since. This occurs every day.  I cannot drink caffeine anymore because I get extra dizzy. My balance is off. I got my heart checked in which I had to wear a heart monitor and get an echo. It came back and nothing is wrong with my heart. I also cannot take a deep breath. I always have shortness of breath. I had three episodes in which I thought I was actually going to pass out and my arms and legs were tingly and I was nauseated. I went to the emergency room and nothing came back from my labs. I am lightheaded when I get up fast. I no longer have nausea and appendages tingle.  All of this occurred on the first dose and I did not receive the second dose.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the vaccination the patient reported dizziness and possible rash on her upper chest. It was difficult to assess if the rash was truly a rash or it was simply skin lesions that were already present (patient claimed she did not know). It did not resemble a maculopapular rash. It marginally resembled minor hives/urticaria. Patient did not report any localized symptoms at injection site. Patient was informed to remain seated and that her vitals would be taken and she would be further observed. Then about 10 minutes after this (25 minutes after vaccination), patient reported difficulty breathing. Facial redness was noted at this point and patient&#39;s breathing sounded difficult. Emergency medical services were called and EpiPen was administered at this point. Patient began to tremble and pace of breathing increased. Emergency medical technicians arrived, took vitals / EKG, and assessed the patient. EMT assessment did not reveal urticaria. EMT instructed patient to control her breathing. The EMTs believe that it may not have been a true reaction but rather the patient may have been suffering from an anxiety attack. Patient was then taken to local ER for further evaluation.

I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

The next day I woke up with faint symptoms of covid 19, pain in the chest, a little difficulty breathing, headache, dry cough and diarrhea. After a couple of days everything was fine.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Migraine afternoon of 1/25/2021.  She then experienced feelings of nausea, mouth-watering, feeling overheated.  While resting during the onset of these symptoms she then felt like she couldn&#39;t breath, experiencing pain in the sides of her chest.  The next symptoms that occurred were angioedema to the face, she described her eyes getting so puffy she couldn&#39;t see.  She also described her skin getting reddened and itching all over.  She took Benadryl at home and started to feel better in about 1 hour.

Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

                                                The shot went in my arm and I immediately started feeling itchy. Before the needle was out, I knew something was wrong but almost didn?t believe how fast it happened. My throat started itching and swelling shut. I was in full blown anaphylactic shock in less than 2 minutes. I got an EpiPen shot in the parking lot and was admitted into the hospital where I continued having various reactions. A week after the shot, I?m still breaking out in hives uncontrollably.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

                                                After my first dose, I had a sore arm for a few days. After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

I would breath in and I felt like my lungs would feel the way you feel when you stretch the day or 2 after working out super intensely

I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

Patient felt fine when she left the pharmacy and headed home. 20-30 minutes after she left the pharmacy she began to feel that she was having trouble swallowing and eventually noticed that she was having trouble breathing and had bumps on her tongue as well as swollen lips. She drove to the ER and arrived at 3:50 PM where they administered her EpiPen along with benadryl and prednisone. She felt better within 15-20 minutes of EpiPen administration and remained in the hospital for 4 hours until her blood pressure was stable. She is still taking prednisone and has not had any other issues since ER discharge.

                                                While waiting in after the vaccination I experience the slightest discomfort with my breathing but thought it might be related to double masking. Upon driving home, I realized I had non-itchy and non-painful hives on the upper portion of my right cheek and the lower jaw on the left side. As time progressed, the hives disappeared from left side and moved down the right side of my face. After it passed on the right side it reappeared on the left side and followed the same pattern. My dermatographia also returned on my chest and I haven&#39;t had an episode of it for over year. The roof of my mouth was also itchy. All hives, itchy mouth, and slight breathing discomfort passed by 7 pm without the use of an antihistamine. No other signs of allergic reaction has been noted since. Breathing concerns passed the quickest (after 2 or so hours), then itchy mouth, and last the non-itchy hives. Other than that, I experienced the common side effect of body aches during the night and pain in vaccinated arm.

When I arrived patient was laying down on a chair with a friend, shaking with seizure like activity but alert and oriented to person place and time. Upon my arrival she was shaking, vomited x 1 and then complained about chest pain.   Vitals upon my arrival: HR 58, o2 100% RR appeared to be around 22-24 (hyperventilating) BP 88 systolic (manual)--repeated by medics upon arrival minutes later 110/72.   Given throat closing sensation, vomiting, shortness of breath I advised to call 911 and ordered Epinephrine x 1 which was given by RN immediately. Pt was then placed on the grown chin up, she continued to shake throughout entire body but continued to be alert and oriented. Medics then arrived on seen, started an IV, glucose by medics 84, IVF started by medics. Pt was transported to ER via medics.   Pt is not a patient, last visit 2017. Pt did state she has hx of POTS and DRESS syndrome to Lamictal. Reports taking cetirizine this AM, Zofran and Oxycodone and Baclofen (prescribed by external PCP?).   Prior to transport to ER pt continued to be alert oriented, but shaking and twitching throughout her body. MD verbally communicated to patient to not receive the 2nd dose given her severe anaphylaxis like reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Pt can be referred to allergist after ER follow up by PCP.  Denied pregnancy.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

I checked my temperature but that was normal, around 97 F. I tried different positions to make breathing easier but the pressure would not lift. Around 3 AM I used my (expired) inhaler. Almost immediately I could feel my chest getting lighter. I used my inhaler again around 10 am. The chest tightness did not lift a noticable amount until around 2 PM. By 5 PM all tightness had subsided.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0162) (at the age of 23-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and diagnosed at age 2, allergy and allergy to bull dogs. Concomitant medications included budesonid taken for allergy, start and stop date were not reported; formoterol fumarate dihydrate taken for allergy, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her lungs felt swollen in Apr2021, the back of her tongue felt numb/developed a numb tongue on 17Apr2021, throat was itchy then sore/her throat was sore and itchy on 17Apr2021, chest pain on 17Apr2021, not quite normal breathing/uncomfortable breathing/heavy breathing that was more of an irregular breathing/out of breath walking up the steps on 17Apr2021 and fatigue on 17Apr2021. A family member had some reaction to the first pfizer covid-19 vaccine. Wanted to know where can she find information to determine if the second vaccine shot is safe. 40 minutes from the time of the injection the back of her tongue felt numb and her throat was itchy then sore. About 40 minutes after that those symptoms went away. Later in the day she had chest pain and not quite normal breathing. After using her asthma inhaler twice in a short time this dissapated. Fatigue remained for about a week. Her daughter was prescribed Metronidazole 500mg (she initially thought it was penicillin) and the packaging information of the antibiotic says not to receive any vaccines. She was scheduled for her second dose next Tuesday (18May2021) and wanted to know if it would this be applicable to the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. Mother calling on behalf of daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine on 17Apr2021. She was told to wait 30 minutes after the vaccine and was okay, however after 40 minutes after the vaccine she developed a numb tongue, her throat was sore and itchy. This subsided within about 30 minutes (also reported as 40 minutes). About 4 hours after the vaccine she developed chest pain and uncomfortable breathing. Her daughter states her lungs felt swollen, and was out of breath walking up the steps. She did use her AuviQ and albuterol inhaler and the first dose of AuviQ didn&#39;t work so she repeated it and it helped. She called the doctor and used her peak flow meter and the doctor on call stated that her reading was okay and did not need further medical attention. After that evening those side effects went away. Caller has a past medical history of asthma and allergies to bulldogs. If she was even around someone who has been near a bull dog she will develop chest symptoms. Mother spoke with CDC and they told her as long as her daughter didn&#39;t go to the ER it was okay for her to receive the vaccine and wanted to know if she get her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled to receive it next Tuesday (18May2021). Her doctor said that some people react to the polyethylene glycol and want to know if she could get tested for that. After the patient received the vaccine, her tongue was numb and her throat was sore and itchy but it went away. This started 40 minutes after the patient received the vaccine. 4 hours after the patient received the vaccine, she had chest pain and heavy breathing. The caller is nervous because the patient has only had this chest pain during a severe allergic reaction in the past. The patient do about the second dose. The patient was also prescribed an antibiotic this week and the antibiotic paperwork said not to have any vaccines while taking that product. The patient is due for the second dose of the vaccine this week, is it okay to get because she will still be on the penicillin. This event happened after receiving the first dose of the vaccine on 17Apr2021. The patient also had fatigue for a week. The patient had the heavy breathing that was more of an irregular breathing. The patient&#39;s lungs felt swollen, it felt like there was weight on her chest, it was uncomfortable breathing. The caller felt out of breath walking up the steps. The caller used her inhaler twice. The patient underwent lab test included investigations: the on call doctor had the patient do the peak flow meter and it was fine, over 550 on 17Apr2021. No more information was available. The doctor also had the patient press her chest to see if there was pain when she touched it and there was not so the on call doctor felt comfortable not making the patient go to the emergency room. Caller reports that her daughter received her first vaccine dose on 17Apr2021 and afterwards experienced a severe reaction with symptoms including, tongue swelling, sore throat, and Chest pain. Caller reported that it didn&#39;t getm severe enough for her to need an Epi pen. Caller reports that they have an appointment to see her doctor as well, for further discussion. She calls today to ask if symptoms with the second dose are expected to be worse than they were with the first shot and timing of the second dose. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID- 19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of the event her lungs felt swollen was unknown, the event fatigue was recovered in Apr2021, the other events was recovered on 17Apr2021.

                                                ?Pfizer-BioNTech Covid 19 Vaccine EUA? The night of getting the first shot I barely slept because I had chills all night long &amp; my entire body was so sore it hurt to lay in any position. In the morning, I still had extreme muscle pain all over. I was extremely light headed &amp; dizzy, I had a throbbing headache so I  took 2 aleve pills. I was getting super nauseous and almost passed out while trying to get to my bathroom just in time to throw up only water. Just before throwing up my vision went fuzzy,  my ears were ringing, I was dripping sweat, it was getting hard to breathe, &amp; my hands were shaking.  After taking a cold shower, laying down, &amp; drinking some water I feel a bit better but not 100% normal.

                                                Pt had a scheduled appt at 1235 pm for her 2nd dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 6/4/21 at our store .  Pt stated that she had some &#34;chest tightness&#34; shortly after the first dose (~4/24/21). After reviewing VAR filled out by patient today, I consulted with pt about having a reaction to the first dose.  Pt stated that EMS observed her for 30 minutes after the 1st vaccination and patient self-reports that she recovered without the use of an epi pen (pt does carry an epipen on her at all times) within that 30 minute window and was allowed to leave.  We administered 2nd dose with the understanding that patient recovered from 1st dose with no breathing difficulties or swelling of tongue or throat (just chest tightness as reported by pt).   After administering the second dose today, Pt began to show signs of an allergic reaction ~ 5 minutes after administration  and we administered the epi-pen and  911 was called.  Observed that pt vomited and complained of chest tightness, tight throat , difficulty breathing and being hot and &#34;sleepy&#34; after second shot.  Pt appeared to be alert and oriented and was sitting in a chair.  EMS arrived and pt is now under their care.  We dont know the lot number of the 1st covid vaccination but the lot used today was EW0167 with an expiration of 8/31/21.

Called 911 transported to ER. Monitored cardiac unit for 24 hours, HA. Two months of HAs. I went home and I don&#39;t recall exact how everything transpired.  I do remember they wanted follow up with PCP.  I developed blood clots in R arm, platelets were high since getting vaccinated.  *originally diagnosed with colitis but now diagnosed with Chrohns disease.  1/16 I did have a personal injury in a parking lot that exacerbated the issues, I was vaccinated after.  *In transition with new doctors now and have not really discussed the potential of this being caused by vaccine, focused more on pain management.  **before this vaccine, I was relatively healthy before, no issues.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

                                                also had a very hoarse voice; throat starting feeling a little tight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A 24-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EK9231), intramuscular on 31Dec2020 15:45 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic sinusitis from an unknown date and seasonal allergies from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included azithromycin. The patient previously took penicillin and experienced allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine on 31Dec2020, the patient&#39;s throat started feeling a little tight. However, she did not have trouble breathing. The feeling continued for the next 3 hours. She also had a very hoarse voice. The ER suggested that she will be seen. They did an exam and gave her Benadryl which completely resolved her symptoms. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care.

Reports she spoke with her healthcare provider and was told there was no concern about this vaccine. Received vaccine and within a few minutes red blotchy hives spread up her arms, neck and torso.  EMS responded. Client reported this was a common response for her and stated she has had about 8 similar episodes over the last several months. After about 20 minutes the rash continued. No difficulty breathing had occurred, however the client then reported  that occasionally  some tightness in her breathing occurred after about 45 minutes. After initially declining to be transported to the ER, she agreed to be transported to be monitored.  Client declined the use of the stretcher and walked out with EMS to be transported to the ER for observation.

My face turned bright red and my heart rate increased to 152 beats per minute.  My respirations became very labored and my blood pressure was 187/97. I was monitored for 30 minutes afterwards. The nurse placed ice packs on the back of my neck to cool down. She continually monitored my vital signs. Upon leaving my blood pressure was still elevated, but improved.

When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body. I called the nursing coordinator for that day and asked what to do and she said to go to the ER. When I arrived at the ER, they said I had 100 degree temp., I was tacky. They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better. I went home and slept after the ER all day and night and by Sunday 01/31/2021, I was feeling better after excedrine and advil

Next morning 1/28 very sore leg muscles, hot flashes, headache. As day went on my limbs were tingling and had some numbness.  Increasingly getting fatigue and wasn&#39;t able to keep my head up for more than 30sec with out it falling. By 5p I could not move left arm at all and called PCP office and went to ER. Over 5 hours I got  feeling back in left arm and left ER at 10:30p. CT was done to rule out stroke or other injury. Next day around 2p my right arm started to get more numb and I wasn&#39;t able to move it much. SOB and throat tightening came back briefly. Later that day lumbar puncture done to rule out guillain barre syndrome. Numbness is not as severe now 2/3 and each day since 1/28 it gets increasingly less

                                                Patient was given second dose.  30 minutes later she sat down on a couch and was breathing short and shallow.  She was not responsive and mildly shaking.  I gave her an Epipen shot and in less than a minute she was a wake and feeling much better.  She drank some water.  911 was not called because her mother was a nurse and was nearby.  She came and picked her up and took her to a doctor.  I checked on the patient this afternoon and she is feeling fine other than feeling tired.  She has a medical history of weight loss surgery and not dieting properly.  The administrator of the home  said she has a history of not feeling well and almost fainting from not eating properly after her weight loss surgery.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

On March 15, 2021 I started with a top left back pain (same side as injection) where is it painful to move and difficult to breathe deeply. I&#39;m not completely sure if this is related to the COVID vaccine but it is on the same side of the site of injection.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I was lightheaded, nauseated and my tongue began to get itchy and swollen like the beginning of an anaphylactic reaction. I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

These symptoms have lasted for over seven weeks and are so bad to the point I cannot eat or sleep and have sought out emergency medical attention. In this same time period, I got what my doctors believe is Eosinophilic Esophagitis where my throat is now chronically inflamed, making it difficult to swallow. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings when I never had a history of this.  I have tried taking several medications and PPI&#39;s with no success as well as trying every type of diet and lifestyle change possible with no success. I have not recovered from this and expect it will be some time before I do.

A 24-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0153), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 24-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 diagnosis in May2020, COVID-19 test taken via nasal swab on 01May2020 was positive.  The patient had never had an allergic reaction in her life and she was not allergic to anything that she knew of. There were no concomitant medications (no medications within 2 weeks prior to vaccination). The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine.The patient received her first vaccine on 10Apr2021. After the shot she felt her throat closing. She experienced Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest within 10 minutes of vaccine administration, also reported as at 14:15. They called the Paramedics, who gave her Benadryl injection when they picked her up from the site where she received her vaccination, which was a drug store. She was then transported to the emergency department. She was hospitalized and treated with Benadryl injection for the Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest. She was monitored for 3-4 hours, and her symptoms were not worsening and she was able to leave the hospital. Ever since, this is the 9th day, everyday she had severe shortness of breath. She had no wheezing. Her chest clenches. It scared her so she had gone to the Emergency Department 2 more times for it. She had gone there 3 times in total. She had been to the Emergency Room a few times and saw doctors there. Her throat closing stopped later that evening and had come back about 4 times. Since then, she was not sure if it was just the sensation of the throat closing because it is coupled with shortness of breath. She had the sensation of throat closing about 4 times. She was short of breath every day since receiving the vaccine and up to 4 times each day. Sometimes it was worse than others. She had it while on the call (19Apr2021) and rated it 4/10. On 14Apr2021 she went to the Emergency Department in the middle of the night. She rated that episode as 9/10. Episodes of symptoms had been ongoing and reoccurring since the day of vaccine administration. She had a COVID-19 test post vaccination in Apr2021 (unknown results). The outcome of  Tightening/ Chest tightness, heating up, swelling of throat and chest, throat closing and severe shortness of breath was not recovered.

                                                About 12 hours after the second dose I felt extremely sick. I had a fever, chills, body aches, sore throat and extreme exhaustion. Around 30 hours later I started to have severe chest pain. It was hard to breathe and for a few hours I was worried I was going to have a heart attack. I put on my Apple Watch to record my heart rate and it was jumping from the 70?s to the 115?s just laying in bed. Now after reading that I am not the only one who had severe chest pain I am worried about any long lasting effects since I decided not to go to the doctor for these chest pains.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

                                                approximately 5 min after receiving the vaccine, felt flushed and a swelling sensation in the throat. Felt like a globes sensation without itching or hives.   Nurses at vaccine site checked vitals multiple times. BP at start of symptoms 152/106, HR 140, O2 sat 99%. EMS was called but I did not feel symptoms were worsening, my lungs were clear without wheezing or stridor. I made the decision to not have EMS transport me to the ER. Symptoms improved so I decided to not go to the ER. Symptoms returned moderately for which I took 25 mg tab of Benadryl. As time progressed, symptoms waxed and waned, about 4 hours after the vaccine the globus sensation in the throat has improved, but there is a globs sensation in the lower esophagus, almost GERD-like in nature.

Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

I felt light headed and I don&#39;t get that with my panic attacks; At 15 minutes, my heart was beating really fast. They checked my vitals - pulse and BP was elevated. Pulse is over 130 and normally when I have an anxiety attack it doesn&#39;t go above 110. Went to the  ER . The breathing felt better after thirty min after being in ER and Blood pressure 1-2 hours later went down. No treatment. After about two weeks I saw my primary care doctor for check up.

Took 50mg Benadryl at bedtime along with Claritin. Woke up 1/25/21 with swelling of both lips and swelling in throat what felt like around tonsil and lymph area (have had tonsillectomy). Went to ER was given additional Benadryl  PO, IV Decadron and  IV Pepcid. Was discharged home with a prednisone taper prescription, Benadryl and Pepcid. My full biological sister also had minor hives after her second dose of Pfizer , but has never had an anaphylactic reaction in the past and her onset was within the first day after vaccination.

A 25-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 07Jan2021 13:30 at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, fibromyalgia, idiopathic hypersomnia, seasonal allergies (dust, ragweed, pollen, dander), covid-19. Concomitant medication in two weeks included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA), modafinil, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), ergocalciferol (VIT D). No other vaccine in four weeks. 1-2 min after shot the patient became flushed and felt uncomfortable/ couldn&#39;t sit still, began feeling clammy, saw spots, BP dropped to 60s/30s, all other vitals stable, felt like throat was closing and couldn&#39;t breathe well, hands were numb, lips were white/ blue. No itching or hives. Resolved with trendelenburg and rest, fluids given in ED. WBCs and neutrophils and platelets elevated 3 hours later. Coat hanger neck/ shoulder pain for the next few days. Adverse event start date was 07Jan2021 01:30. Event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Covid was not tested post vaccination. Outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded.

My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

                                                Had my second covid vaccine 2/12/2021 at 11:55am and woke up 4:30am 2/13/2021 with irregular heart rate, shortness of breath, wheezy, achy, and so weak I could barely move.  My Mom is a Nurse Practitioner, checked my pulse and felt an irregular beat, my heart rate was fast 105 beats/min at rest and 142 beats/min with exertion, oxygen was 91% and I had a fever 100.5F orally.

She started having very fast palpitations and felt short of breath with associated lightheadedness.  This was very severe for approximately 2 minutes.  States she got out of the shower and had to sit down.  She put on her smart watch and states her heart rate was greater than 200 at that time.  After approximately 2 minutes her heart rate decreased in the 130-150 range and she had mild symptoms for approximately 30 minutes.  Her symptoms have subsequently resolved.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

The patient received her vaccine on 1/23/21.  Within 12 hours of vaccination, the patient developed a rash (no reported symptoms of breathing difficulty).  The rash did not resolve, so the patient went to an urgent care on 1/25 and she was prescribed 6 days of prednisone, benadryl and famotidine.  She reports that the rash continued, but waxed/waned.  She presented to the ED on 1/27/21 with ongoing rash as well as an episode of throat tightness (which developed after she took her prednisone, benadryl, and a zyrtec).    On presentation to ED, the patient&#39;s BP=123/72, HR=65, RR=16, SpO2=99%.  The provider described the rash as &#34;warm, dry, erythematous wheal-like rash over central chest around perimeter of her face and scattered across extremities.&#34;  No other symptoms observed on physical exam. Throat tightness had resolved. Rash was considered mild and the patient was felt to be stable for discharge to home with a new prescription for Epi-pen.  Patient did not respond to post-discharge phone call follow-up.  Does not appear to be anaphylaxis,

                                                fatigue; Throat tightness; sore throat; Rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 25-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 06Mar2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6025) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Penicillin. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), took the week prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced rash (Amoxicillin tablets. Had allergic reaction when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime).   The patient experienced sore throat, throat tightness and rash, all on 06Mar2021 14:30. Clinical course: After receiving COVID 19 Vaccine, within one to two minutes of vaccine very strong sore throat and tightening of the throat. Was taken to emergency room by the ambulance that was at the testing center. At that time the ambulance at testing center recommended taking two Benadryl&#39;s, which started to work and sore throat and tightness completely went away about 15 minutes after that and then started to come back at time of riding in ambulance to the ER. While being written up and vitals checked, the rash (blotchy) developed to which she was given a Solumedrol steroid shot to fix the rash which amazingly cleared up rash and it ended up back to white. Had amazing clear photos of rash and it being red and sloshes starting to appear. After caller left ER and went home and had couple of follow up prescriptions of Pepcid and Atarax to help combat rash for two days. Now she was taking Allegra still for adverse events. Reporter mentioned sore throat was on and off but it had improved and still had a little bit of a rash. Caller had a little bit of tightness and it had improved if she exerted herself a lot the tightness got worse she wsn&#39;t referring to a big exertion but provided example like if she is going to the grocery store. The rash was severely reduced but was apparent. Caller also mentioned she had pretty severe fatigue after receiving vaccine unsure if this was because of the vaccine or an allergic reaction to some medication in her. She missed work on Monday and part time on Tuesday due to having to take breaks and naps during the day. Caller went into work but she did not feel up to working a full day in the office and was working remotely from home right now. The patient had allergic reaction to amoxicillin tablets when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime. Caller stated she knew how important it is to report not sure if there is an association between Amoxicillin and COVID ingredients. May have another allergy that was contributing but Amoxicillin was only other known allergy. Caller was asking for the next steps since she still has not fully recovered her throat, she is still feeling sore and tighter than normal and her skin was still redder than normal. When she had the rash it was red blotchy and warm to the touch it was no longer warm to the touch. Outcome of the events sore throat, throat tightness and rash was recovering, of event fatigue was unknown.

                                                Within 1 or 2 hours, I was getting hives on my arms and my neck. My throat was getting irritated and swollen a little bit. I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

Went to urgent care and was given a steroid shot, oxygen level was good, no signs of respiratory distress just severe allergic reaction. Prescribed to take Prednisone for 3 days twice a day 20 mg and Benadryl at night and Claritin during the day for a few days.

When I measured a few hours later it was at 137/90. It remained like that until the evening when it lowered back down to 120/87. Later that evening, I had a fever and took Tylenol to help. My headache got worse in the evening as well. Arm was sore. This morning (day after my 1st dose) my BP was at 108/79, fever creeped up as the day went on, body aches, arm was hurting more,  headache continued, pressure on chest made it a bit hard to breathe, dizziness, some nausea, brain fog.

                                                Within 1 hour of receiving the vaccine, I had mild tongue swelling, shortness of breath, fingers swelling, intense sweating and faintness. Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, hives developed on my left thigh. The tongue swelling, shortness of breath and faintness happened on and off for the first day. It resolved on its own by the next day. The hives got progressively worse and peaked roughly 48 hours after getting the vaccine. They slowly faded, but are still faintly noticeable. I had general malaise  for the rest of the week. I have photos showing the progression of the hives.

                                                At 5:15 pm, same day as shot, a migraine occurred. A bad migraine, unable to stand because it caused so much pain in my head. at 8:00PM I went to bed due to the pain. at 1:15 AM, my body was in pain. My right rib cage hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my right side. My legs, back, and pelvic bones were in so much pain as well. I felt as if my bones were going to break or I had severely bruised my bones. Breathing, coughing, sneezing hurt because of my rib cage hurting. My migraine had not gone away, and my lymph nodes were really swollen. Couldn&#39;t put my arms down, my neck was swollen and walking hurt because my legs were swollen. This occurred for 24 hours. Next day, migraine is gone and left a headache. Swelling is still prominent and bones still hurt.

                                                High fever (101°F), chills, fatigue, and burning eyes 12h post-injection. 1000mg acetaminophen would reduce fever to ~99°F within 1.5h of dosing, only to return to the high 100/low 101°F range once it starts to wear off. Fever broke in the early am hours of 4/22/21, with the chills going away as fever was gone. The burning eye sensation and tiredness were no longer present upon waking am of 4/23/21.  Itchy skin and hives on feet around noon on 4/21/21. Hives on feet disappeared on their own by early pm of 4/22/21. Itchy and sensitive skin persists as of time of this report in early pm 4/23/21. Shallow breathing (normal and deep breaths were painful), wheezing, and feeling like I&#39;m breathing through a sponge and that there is concrete (serving as weight) in my chest every time I inhaled began early am 4/21/20. I began producing mucus from deep coughs as of late pm 4/22/21 and that also continues to the time of this report, accompanied by wheezing and slightly deeper (but still shallower than normal) breathing.

During the follow up assessment she was asked if she had any reactions from the 1st vaccination she claims that she reported to her manager that time that she can&#39;t move the right side of face and right eye twitching. She also verbalized that the eye twitching was intermittent for 4-5 days. Never consulted a doctor or ER visit.  After vaccine administration she was required to sit for observation for 30 minutes. No reported reactions. Was advised to call the vaccine clinic or RN will call her for follow up. At 14:15 pm RN called above employee while still at work. She claims that the twitching started again on the right eye accompanied by slight throat tightness. Denies any c/o SOB, difficulty of swallowing. Instructed to go to ER but she verbalized she will go home and then go to urgent care if needed but still refused to go to the hospital ER.

She waited a while but then had difficulty breathing and extreme chest pain so she went to the ED.  Over the next several hours they performed a chest Xray, EKG, urine tests, and blood tests (metabolic panel, CBC,  test for heart muscle injury, blood clotting problem test)

                                                After receiving my second dose, I was seen by my primary doctor for suspected Celiac disease (which came back positive). I had a strange medical episodes during the bloodwork (April 15th) that they originally assumed was anxiety. Symptoms were shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and loss of feeling in extremities. I?m a first responder and did not feel this was anxiety, but didn?t argue and forgot about it until it happened again.   I had my second episode on April 20th, and debated going to the ER for it. A third episode on April 23rd did put me in the ER. I proceeded to have more episodes on almost a daily basis after that and started monitoring blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and food intake at home (some of my bloodwork levels were off due to the celiac). I purchased a heart rate monitor, a blood glucose meter, and a smartwatch to monitor some of my symptoms. Both devices (monitor and watch) would later flag me as having a suspicious heart rhythm (heart monitor could be for fast/slow rhythm or for arrhythmia, smartwatch flagged me as Afib twice). I could not recreate these results when my husband wore the devices.  Episodes could be as brief as 45 mins or last more than 12 hours. I have a high pain tolerance and illness tolerance, and had to leave work several times due to my symptoms (extremely abnormal for me).   After several more appointments with my primary doc and another visit to the ER (where they did another EKG, an X-ray, and more bloodwork), things were still coming back inconclusive.  After about April 28th, I started having significant chest pain with my episodes. The ER checked me for possible clotting related to the heart issues and my birth control pills. My arrhythmia could not be captured on their devices.   My doctor has since diagnosed it as suspected myocarditis (pending more testing). We?ve ruled out all possible things related to my Celiac diagnosis, and can?t seem to find a cause for this. I had a few things I brought to her attention that may be the cause (pinched nerve at chiropractors, covid vaccine) and she says it may be the vaccine, and said I should report it to you.

                                                Aside from the usual chills, body aches, etc, I ended up calling my doctor over a separate concerning issue - very high heart rate. I woke up at 8am the day after getting my 2nd Pfizer dose, walked to use the restroom, walked back to bed, and laid back down. Within a couple minutes I noticed my heart felt like it was racing and I was out of breath as if I had just come back from a jog, not a trip to the restroom.  Heart rate continued fluctuating from 105-115bpm just laying in bed. Was also feeling fatigued, nauseous, dizzy when standing up, and with slight difficulty breathing. Called advice nurse after 30min of no change. They had me check heart rate manually (had been going off FitBit), and timing was consistent with what FitBit was reading . Nurse advised to keep resting and drink lots of water, scheduled follow-up with a Doctor later in the morning.  It should be noted that I had been alternating between water and Pedialyte constantly all day, starting 5/17 through when this happened (and then the next few days as well), so I should not have been dehydrated. Follow-up call with Dr. (on-call Dr., not my usual one) was scheduled for 11:45am, and by then all concerning heart symptoms had passed. The Dr. basically reiterated what the nurse had told me, in keeping up with fluids. And that sometimes temperature change, even if you don&#39;t completely get a fever, can cause a high heart rate. As more information is coming out regarding younger people developing myocarditis after the mRNA vaccines however, I wanted to mention this in case it could possibly be related.

Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.
