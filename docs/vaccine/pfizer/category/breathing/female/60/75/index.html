After one week, only have occasional chest discomfort. Arrhythmia has returned to baseline occasional PVC. No further chills, headache, nausea or other pains.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper left arm on 12Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She was experiencing nose running, congested and blockage in her nose, and shortness of breath. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. For treatment, she took Mucinex tablets for allergy. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. This was the first dose, her second dose is due on 02Feb2020 and she wants to know if she can skip it.   Before she got it she contacted her primary care due to having allergies before the vaccine and asked if she should take; she was told to hold on but then she went ahead and took it. Within the first 30 minutes she was ok but in an hour is when she had the burning sensation in her chest. The burning sensation lasted about an hour. The dose was administered around 4pm on 12Jan2021.The caller reports that the Mucinex and she has breathing treatment, nebulizer treatments for her lungs, that she did and these things helped. Early this morning she felt she can now close her mouth and breathe normally. It was administered in the upper left arm. She did not require a visit to the doctor or ER. The patient has had no reactions to vaccines in the past nor were any administered on the day of or within the prior 4 weeks. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergy like symptoms, congested and blockage in her nose and shortness of breath which included Mucinex. The patient recovered from burning sensation in her chest on 12Jan2021, from allergy like symptoms/allergy and shortness of breath on 13Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The day of the vaccine there was no reaction. Day 2 I woke up with red angry lump at the injection site, about the size of a 0.50 cent piece.  Later that day I had a fever of 102.5 and chills. Day 3 the redness had spread and still had the lump.  Day 4 or 5 the color changed to purple and the lump had decreased.  It took about a week for the lump to go away.  I still have a discoloration on my arm where the vaccine was given.  It looks a bruise but no pain.  The whole time the area blanched well.  The first dose I had on my left arm and the next day I had a small welt with redness.  I am on my second round of steroids to try and get my asthma under control and had to increase my Advair to the highest dose.  My doctor put me on a antibiotic as well with the second round of steroids.  My asthma is a little better but not at my baseline.

                                                Being a diabetic, my blood sugar was in the 300&#39;s, and even after changing my insulin pump because I believed there may have been an issue with delivery, my blood sugar continued to rise.  I did not eat anything until about 6 PM when my blood sugar began to lower.  At that time, I tried to eat some chicken soup, but after a few mouthfuls, my throat began to constrict and my tongue and the inside of my mouth began to itch.  This continued every time I began to try to eat something and I still could feel what felt like some constriction in the back of my throat the next day (Monday).

                                                On  the day of the shot, by Noon I could feel the vaccine moving into my throat and my  face. My throat and left cheek started to swell and turn slightly red.  I took more Benadryl and called my allergist in the afternoon. They told me I needed to get to the hospital for treatment.  At the hospital, they gave me steriods, benadryl and Pepcid in an IV.  After allowing this to work, they sent me home with a  steriod prescription for 60Mg for the next 5 days.  They asked me to follow up with my allergist if I had other issues , they also told me that I would not be able to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Over the next several days, I continued to have issues with this redness that had grown over my entire face. I looked like I was totally sunburned.  I did not feel well, the redness was very hot, and I struggled with some breathing. I made an appointment on  Monday morning with my allergist, and they adjusted my allergy medicine and gave me more asteroids for 5 more days.   They advised me to use my nebulizer treatments as needed to remove the heaviness in my chest. This redness and swelling has moved around my body, almost as if I can see where the vaccine is at in my body.  It went from my head to my chest/back and right arm. Down to my abdomen, and then down below my knees.  In the morning, it is usually in my face and then it moves around during the day.  I can feel this fluid moving around in my body because the redness brings swelling/fluid.  This last saturday 3/6/2021 was horrible, it was in my right ear and right foot.  It was very painful and made me very dizzy. I struggled to walk.  Then on Sunday morning, I felt fine all day.  Today Monday, it feels like it is in my right foot again, but I feel like It is  getting better.

                                                This is a 60-year-old female who just received her second Pfizer dose of the Covid vaccine earlier today when she says she felt immediately a flushing of her left arm where she had received the vaccination and then some tingling and abruptly followed with difficulty swallowing tongue enlargement, and feeling like she had to &#34;search for my air&#34;. This required her to turn her head leftward to assist in her breathing. She has no associated pruritus. She was given an intramuscular injection of epinephrine at the clinic where she received the vaccination and EMS was activated. She did not demonstrate any changes in her phonation or signs of stridor and there was no wheezing or signs of facial or oral swelling on arrival of paramedics. She received additional intramuscular injection of epinephrine and IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol at that time followed by an albuterol inhalation treatment and transported here as a medical alert. She reports the symptoms are similar to what she is experienced with multiple bee sting allergic reactions in the past. She is never required intubation. She never develops any facial swelling or urticaria.

This lasted about a minute. I just sat there since I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal. I started to feel like my heart was going back to normal so I just sat there for the specified 15 minutes. After I left and was driving home, I stated to feel a shortness of breath and difficulty getting air. I also felt like a hard to swallow. I was about 1 mile from venue so this happened with 30 minutes of receiving the shot. This only lasted what seemed like a short time and then I started to feel like I could get my breath. By the time I returned home I was breathing ok but my lips were a little tingly. I felt fine by 5:00 pm.

There was a small area of linear opacity near the right lung base. This could be related to atelectasis or acute infection. The remainder of the lungs clear, no pleural effusions. Heart size not enlarged. Normal contour of the mediastinum. No acute osseous findings.

                                                A few days after the vaccine on that Wednesday I began having pain in the upper shoulder and back area which persisted to a heaviness in my chest going into Thursday.   Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

Couldn&#39;t talk due to chills without extreme stuttering.  Ended up being transported to a local ER for care where I remained for approximately 7 hours.  Was given IV fluids and Toporol to control fever.  Fever persisted for 72 hours, loss of appetite and extreme fatigue.  Now 7-days post 2nd shot and still experiencing fatigue.

                                                As I pulled up for the 15 minute wait period the symptoms started 5 minutes after I received my vaccine.  A tingling feeling up my left arm to back of my neck. My neck stiffened and then my throat started to close.  Not to where I can&#39;t swallow but just like when I eat food that I&#39;m allergic too, it closes up. The nurse that was overseeing me was holding the umbrella over my car window with the rainfall.  All of a sudden their was lightning &amp; thunder. The nurse threw the umbrella because she was shocked from the lightning. She started to talk to all the other around her and forgot about me. Since I could still swallow I didn&#39;t get her attention. When she returned she asked me the time so I had to pull my phone out. She didn&#39;t know the time of my 15 minutes and sent me away. As soon as I got out of the parking area but still inside amusement park, I started to feel my cheeks becoming numb and my right eye was blurry.  I quickly moved over to the side lane still inside of amusement park and waited.  I called my husband and told him that with the heavy rain I didn&#39;t feel safe driving with my right eye being blurry.  I waiting another 15 minutes before driving home.  That evening the blurriness came back, my eye&#39;s &amp; forehead was tender to touch but no headache.  Only pressure in my head.  My symptoms of closed throat, swollen cheeks, pressure in my head and blurriness continued on Friday, March 12th, Saturday, March 13th, Sunday, March 14th and Monday, March 15th.  As of today, no other systems other than feeling my body has inflammation.

Pain to the back of my neck, a flush of warmth to my upper body and difficulty breathing.  Felt like a truck ran over my chest.  I was weak, dizzy and nauseous as well.  The tingling sensation also affected both my legs. The RN took to their infirmary area and began taking my vitals.  Vitals seems normal, Blood Pressure and Pulse were high.  I am asthmatic but did not bring my inhaler with me.  Because of my difficulty breathing, they decided to inject me with Benadryl which is all they had.  After about twenty minutes, my breathing started to calm down and blood pressure began coming down as well.

                                                Important to share: I had a strong case of Covid in March, 2020. No hospitalization and no need to go to hospital but I was very sick for three weeks. Oddly, after Covid I had odd heart pains and erratic high blood pressure. I saw a cardiologist and my heart was fine but it lasted on and off for months. I&#39;ve been very well for months now.   1) The day after the shot, I felt tired and had a headache, which is expected and no big deal. The evening after the shot I experienced a lot of pain around my heart area. It was very similar to what I experienced post-Covid but more painful. It hurt enough that I went to the ER at Hospital in because of the chest pain. EKG, chest x-ray, and all blood tests were normal.   2) The next day, I fell asleep on a hammock in my backyard. I was wearing jeans and a sweater so the sun wasn&#39;t directly on me but I noticed later that the outside of my R leg and the inside of my L leg were covered in a red, lacey-looking rash. Oddly, my arms and torso had no rash. I called my Internist (Dr.) who asked me to email photos. She said it looked like an allergic reaction to the vaccine and advised me to submit info on this site and to take a benedryl. The rash was definitely where the warm sun hit me.

                                                Received first shot on 3/15/21. On 3/25/21, I developed a rash (hives) around 6:30-7pm. After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

Hurts to touch my left breast area and the pain is a shooting pain that is constant and feels like a stabbing pain.  Hurts to move my left arm.  I&#39;ve been taking 3 Advil at a time and the pain subsides for a couple of hours but comes back.  It doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m sitting up or lying down the pain is always there.  I sometimes feel like I&#39;ve had the wind knocked out of me when the pain radiates to the front of my chest area. There is no longer any pain at the injection site.

                                                I felt fine following vaccination so kept appointment to donate blood 3 days later. I&#39;ve donated many, many times in past without any side effects. It was uneventful.  The following AM, I felt exhausted, dizzy, had mild headache,  thirsty, and had minimal nausea. And when I tried to do my daily walk of 3 miles, I was SOB on hills so I stopped. I had no F/C, cough, CP, palpitations or resp symptoms at rest. I pushed fluids and rested.  I held my BP meds thinking I was a bit dehydrated and maybe my BP was low. After 4 days of no improvement,  I went to see my internist.  Exam, ECG and CBC, Chem 7 were all normal. BP was mildly elevated so I restarted my meds. These symptoms slowly resolved over next several days and now I feel back to normal.  So I don&#39;t know if these were delayed side effects to COVID vaccine or due to the blood donation. I&#39;m a bit worried about receiving the #2 vaccine.

                                                Since this vaccine I now have frequent painful mouth ulcers and tiredness. I seem to lose my breath more easily than before. I am afraid to get the second dose.  There is a study that COVID has these sores as a symptom - why are we not learning of this? Also, no one provided me with any information that would indicate the vaccine could create a problem if given while taking other medications. I have all of my paperwork from that first shot. Yet at this site there is a file full of possible adverse interactions.

                                                Following my first Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine 03/11/21:  **Note, I went through 1 1/2  days dull ache in arm no concerns &gt; days 2--5 went through a HYPER-WELL (no age aches, prior-hurt finger didn&#39;t ache, energy, ladies room habits back to what I reported to daughter &#34;age 20!&#34; for these four days, amazing, enjoyable, then &gt; day 6 very early am woke up with swollen neck lymph nodes half-palm sized rocks on neck, breathing difficulties (lungs not neck), bad dull intrusive headache (different pain from Migraine, or low-hydration pain), cough dry and have called this my HYPER-CRASH because I could barely walk, backward C-shape abdomen hurt (dull ache big always &#43; frequent stabbing pains from below bra bottom line to left abdomen down side then curving to my right across bottom abdomen at both leg-attaches-to-abdomen locations. Difficulty breathing, pain, extreme swelling over upper abdomen when I even drank water to swallow morning Hydrochlorothiazide pill and would stay swollen for 4-8 hours with continued surprise to me gulps of air throughout period, weak, nausea but not vomiting, dizzy, unable to walk more than a few steps at a time, fever taken and wavered from 95 to 99 degrees (my usual body registered 97.8 degrees) but never over 99 degrees, and only over 97.8 degrees perhaps three times very little above it and only for a few hours.  &gt;&gt;I went to Urgent Care in person no better at all on 3/24/21/roughly day 12 after vaccine shot 3/11/21 (Urgent Care) which took blood and urine tests determining roaring infection and blood in tests and a CT CONTRAST scan should be ordered by my PCP asap at appt PCP already scheduled 3/26/21 but she couldn&#39;t order CONTRAST version the PCP would need to and she prescribed three antibiotics to take over next 2 weeks &gt;&gt; I went to PCP 3/26/21/day 14 after vaccine shot and he ordered CT Scan but insurance required pre-auth and they refused it at first so PCP referred me to GI SPECIALIST who again referred me for CT CONTRAST test, which I did have on Friday afternoon 4/16/21 (Clinic), and I await the results today 4/19/21.  Today I continue to have pain abdomen, though softer and throbbing, same C-shaped region, HUGE issue even drinking water with Hydrochlorothiazide pill only for many hours as abdomen swells at bottom bra-line center in a palm size mound for hours, and back hurts badly, solid headache which may be only right side of head more than left but I am taking nothing for any symptoms afraid of GI issue.  NOTING AGAIN: Yes I was diagnosed roughly 2015 with a single incidence of diverticulitis/osis by GI SPECIALIST in Town and went through series of Colonoscopies and tests, but tests only determined incidental few polyps removed over all tests and no incidents at all since that. Knowing what I know of my body and health, the trigger seemed to be the first shot of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccination which remarkably seemed to react first with a few days of better health than I have had for decades (eating, moving, energy etc. for my age), where after days of extreme great health and energy (where I went nowhere, and still did not push myself much) my body then crashed to unable to move much or even breath normally for many days after and with a multi-level infection in my gut that needed three antibiotics and after those I still hurt in the same locations.  I cannot confidently rule out the Vaccine as the cause, and what I know of my body suggests in fact some &#34;overdrive&#34; function in my system was triggered and then caused the crash that resulted in infection and that continues to interfere with my walking, eating, moving, breathing, and even drinking a small glass of water today.  Final note: PCP confirmed I should take the second Vaccine Pfizer shot, which I did on 4/1/21 - same site, Lot #EW0150, after which second vaccine shot I had the same two days of dull arm pain, and I continued to finish the antibiotics until finished (but pain though softer continues to today).  I did not experience a #-Days HYPER-WELL episode then HYPER-CRASH after this second vaccine shot, only the arm ache, but throughout was still very unwell (breathing, pain, no activity, weak, unable to eat, swelling, headache, cough intermittent, back hurts, etc.) throughout, and same to this day 4/19/21 as I await CT CONTRAST results. I felt compelled to share I feel this was triggered by the first Vaccine shot, and would not have happened had I not had the Vaccine shot. Thank you.

                                                Received the shot about 1:30.  Everything was fine.  By evening, the arm was sore and left armpit hurt.  Went to bed about 10.  Woke up about 1:30/2:00 with left arm hurt a lot.  Took Advil and went back to bed.  Woke up at 4 am to get ready for work and felt awful.  Noticed was out of breath on short horizontal walk from bedroom to bathroom, chest tight, acting like an asthma attack.  Took a puff of albuterol inhaler and went back to sleep.  Got up just before 7, still sore to breath.  Grabbed oximeter (being asthmatic, I have one) and noticed )s level down to 94/95 when normally it reads 98/99 on this one.  Called allergist to cancel allergy shot scheduled for that morning.  Took another puff of albuterol.  (Waiting to see if need nebulizer.)  Breathing becoming easier and reading now about 97/98 with pulse lower, more normal.  Lungs a bit touchy this time of year anyway.  And I have had allergic reactions in the past take place as an asthma attack.  (For instance, if I eat a small quantity of something with yellow dye 5 in it, I will notice that my breathing is more difficult.)

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EP7534 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left second dose on 07Apr2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient went to urgent care in the morning, and they ran an EKG, urine analysis, and chest X-ray: all with unknown results. They were concerned it could be something worse along with potential pneumonia, so they sent me to the emergency room. In the emergency room, I received a CT scan where they found multiple pulmonary embolisms (1 large one in my right and multiple in my left lung). The patient stated that she had just had my yearly physical the previous week (Apr2021), with no signs of any health issues. With that, the doctors believed my condition to be related to my 2nd dose, so I was admitted to the hospital. I had to stayed for 2 nights. I am now on blood thinners, other meds (pain medications), and require oxygen during sleep (O2 levels drop too low). I have been referred to lung and hematology specialists. Also, reported that patient experiencing significant shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain under the rib. This persisted for some time until she presented to the emergency department found to have segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolus. Additionally, the patient experienced blood clots, chest pain, and shortness of breath due to extreme pain. Hypercoagulable work-up pending. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) with result of negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.

The patient stated that during her second dose last Thursday on 08Apr2021, she had an anaphylactic reaction and she couldn&#39;t breathe and long story short she had to go to the emergency room and she was given all kinds of epi shots and treatment and stuff and eventually she had to be kept in the ICU unit. She is not sure why she had such a severe reaction. She wanted to report that since then she has kept track every day on how she has been and she actually thought yesterday was the first day that she had felt better. She had extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, upper back pain and even a bloody nose on 10Apr2021 and also she couldn&#39;t see out of her left eye for about 2 hours. Then on 11Apr2021, she had severe pain at the back of her neck with a headache that lasted about 20 minutes and she couldn&#39;t move her neck. She had diarrhea and the only temperature she had was on 12Apr2021, it was only 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn&#39;t bad, but she had really bad diarrhea on 12Apr2021 and she took Imodium.

She didn&#39;t sleep since Wednesday morning until last night finally and she only slept for an hour since Wednesday morning. She woke up on 15Apr2021 and had no symptoms except her left and her right hips, both, had severe pain and she could barely walk and she couldn&#39;t bend at all. All she could do it take Tylenol and she used a heating pad and the pain was excruciating. She went to bed last night and she did sleep for maybe a total of 2 hours and when she woke up this morning her left hip seemed to be a little better but her right hip is still in severe pain and now her right knee joint is in severe pain too. Other than that, she has no other symptoms just the joint pain. She didn&#39;t know it would go on for this long, it has been over a week now and she just wanted to let us know about this.

This 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: ER8731 and expiry date unknown, Solution for injection), via an unknown route on 12Apr2021 at 15:05 (at the age of 60-years-old) at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included allergies, asthma, she had anaphylaxis in the past to allergies. (Unspecified allergens). The patient added that she had issues for about a year before her surgeon had to do a surgery on her throat. She added she was fortunate because her thyroid was in her airways 14 years ago and her body exploded with allergies and her throat closed a lot. When the doctor did the surgery, the doctor opened her throat up more so that if she had another anaphylaxis it would not result in death. Concomitant medications was not reported. On the same date, after the vaccination the patient had anaphylactic reaction. She stated that happened 62 minutes, it might have been 64 minutes and also stated a few minutes after 60 minutes. The vaccination facility released her after 30 minutes at 15:35 and when she realized something was happening it was 16:10 when the patient realized what it was that she was experiencing. The vaccine facility held onto her for 30 minutes, so she got the vaccine around 15:05 and they watched her for 30 minutes. She believed it was around 65 minutes later that she started noticing something was happening. The patient started like a flushed feeling. She does not know to describe it, it was like she had a drink or something like she felt flush or something over her system like a wave or something. It was like a strong drink or something. She does not drink a lot but it was like woohooo, a wave of something, and then she felt woozy. It was not too bad at first, she was at a bank drive through and she was not driving. The patient was going to pick something up so she stopped for 5 to 10 minutes. She was on the phone with a friend. She felt woozy. The patient asked her husband to buy diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Her husband called back when she got done at the bank, and she was only 10 minutes from her house. The patient had her EpiPen with her. The patient was feeling better and she still feels a little tight in her throat and the way she explained it yesterday was that it was like someone had their finger down her throat, it was uncomfortable. She was just a little uncomfortable, just a little today, not too bad. She added that she was having a hard time focusing. Today, the patient felt tight, scratchy, and hoarse. It was not like it was last night. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: EW0ISO) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included she had lupus, sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications not reported. The patient previously took Pneumonia Vaccine on 04Mar2021 (Anatomical Location: Left arm); took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: the lot number starts with ER something and then it ends with a 3) as single dose for covid-19 immunization; took azathioprine for lupus and had allergic reaction; took belimumab (BENLYSTA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Lot Number: PV7G; Expiration Date: Jun2023, NDC: 49401-088-01, Number on the side: 0147098) to an unspecified date, self injection once a week for lupus. She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn&#39;t super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn&#39;t done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn&#39;t stop and she told herself that if it didn&#39;t stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn&#39;t been eating a lot so she hasn&#39;t had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn&#39;t swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can&#39;t recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn&#39;t even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn&#39;t help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren&#39;s disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous&#34; was recovered on 17Apr2021. The outcome of events &#34;Feeling of warmth, Vaccination site pain, Hyperaesthesia, Vaccination site erythema, Tiredness&#34; not recovered. The outcome of the event &#34;Headache&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

This 60-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 27Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8731) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congestive heart failure, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Concomitant medication(s) included aripiprazole (ABILIFY) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atorvastatin calcium (ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported, noted as on of the 2 new heart medication; and another unspecified heart medication. No other vaccine within 4 weeks.  The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 27Apr2021, then 2 days later on 29Apr2021 she developed side effects of body aches and couldn&#39;t get comfortable sitting, laying down, or standing, and her feet hurt, the top of her feet hurt really super bad and her legs hurt. She stated she was feeling &#34;fair to partly cloudy&#34; and &#34;this is just beyond anything&#34;. She stated she literally didn&#39;t want to exist anymore the pain was that horrible, that when she was experiencing adverse effects she couldn&#39;t get comfortable in any way, nowhere to go, nothing to do, no warm bath, no hot warm or cool compresses, it was just her whole body. She said there was nothing that would help and she just didn&#39;t know if she could do that again. She only had relief through paracetamol (TYLENOL) and she took so much that she felt her liver was in jeopardy. She stated it was a really bad experience. The patient was also having incredible chest pressure and shortness of breath, onset date unspecified. She had a diagnosis of heart failure/a history of congestive heart failure, with the body aches she was having, she thought she was going into heart failure. She did call an ambulance twice (maybe 29Apr2021 then 01May2021; she didn&#39;t remember exactly which days) and the emergency medical technicians (EMT) took an EKG each time. The first time she called the ambulance the EMT&#39;s offered to take her to the hospital. Her EKG did look abnormal but it could have been attributed to her history of heart related issues or anxiety. The second time her chest started hurting it was hard to distinguish between pain and pressure. There was definitely pressure. There was also pain across her breasts (onset date unspecified) and underneath her arm (on 29Apr2021; initially she was pressing under her arm and she had pain really bad there), she was questioning her lymph nodes. Then the pain went around her back and then her whole back started hurting and her whole body was hurting, onset date 29Apr2021. She had never experienced anything like this before, as stated. She also reported that her concentration levels were off (onset date unspecified). She couldn&#39;t listen to music or do anything like that. She spoke with her doctor but being that sick made her so weary (onset date unspecified). The patient reported she didn&#39;t know if her symptoms were because of the COVID-19 vaccine or because of her new heart medication, but she said it&#39;s stupid to think her symptoms could be caused from her new pills. Her doctor wanted blood work on 27Apr2021 primarily because of all the medical diseases she had. She&#39;s guessing maybe blood work would give her an indication of why the vaccine made her feel the way it did. She went on 05May2021 to get bloodwork. She went to the bathroom 12 times a night to urinate (onset date unspecified) and she asked her doctor to put her on Lasix so she could just get the urine out. The doctor told her that her heart and her lungs sound good.  The patient asked if she should still get the second dose of the vaccine as she was worried that the symptoms could be worse after the second dose. She was supposed to return for her second COVID-19 vaccine on 14May2021, but she was not going (though she knew she needed to get the second dose), she did not want to get it.  The events body aches, feet hurting/legs hurting, pain underneath her arm, back pain, were ongoing but lessened in severity. As of the time of reporting, she had started to feel better, these events (body aches, feet hurting/legs hurting, pain underneath her arm, back pain) were resolving. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

I wasn&#39;t able to even dial my phone.  A construction worker on the side of the highway called for the ambulance and I was transported back to the ER.

                                                2nd dose:  Stinging a few minutes after shot, I felt really woozy, and then started shaking all over having a hard time processing and talking.  Went home the next day (Wed)  fever, chills, headache, 24 hours better, returned to work on Thursday, day (2).  Day (3), Friday, I  noticed a red rash at the site of the injection earlier in the day, but no symptoms, just a little tender.  Friday evening I noticed a little SOB,  a little burning sensation under my skin on both forearms, and a couple times felt a little dizzy, but I didn&#39;t think much about it.  Day (4) Saturday morning, I went to spin class, I felt a little off, halfway through spin class I noticed I was struggling with some breathing, thought it was because I was wearing mask, but pushed through.  Ran a couple of errands afterwards and then noticed the SOB was continuing, my skin started burning again under forearms and now my legs with tingling into my feet.  At this point I decided I probably needed to go home.  On my way home my chest started to hurt in the very center of my chest, and slowly felt like some pressure, with squeezing sensation.  Then starting at the center of my chest I could almost feel what felt like a numbness creepy from my chest to my throat.  I went to the ER.  My legs felt really wobbly and had a difficult time walking, and was feeling dizzy.  They ran a variety of blood work and tests.  They noted my D-dimers were elevated and (4) lymph nodes enlarged.  They ran an additional series of test and released me at 10pm with follow-up to cardiologist.   I am still experiencing SOB, not as bad, and the burning sensations under my skin.

Didn&#39;t notice until I left the vaccine site and was on the way home in car because covered by mask. Note I am a very fair skin, freckled red haired woman. I was very, very nervous and had gotten myself to the point of tears. Perhaps the flushing was from that. Have had similar flushing when drinking red wine.  Swelling in lymph node in supraclavicular area on same side as shot. Has happened with Flu shot once. Slight fever for a short period of time and fatigue. I continue to have slight shortness of breath from having covid on. 4/3/20. Nothing different.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

A 61-year-old female patient, not pregnant, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 02Feb2021 14:30, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure, and sciatica. Concomitant medications included insulin glargine (LANTUS); metformin; hydrochlorothiazide; candesartan; glipizide (GLIPIZIDE XL) and; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) - all taken for unspecified indications with start and stop dates not reported. The patient previously received sitagliptin (JANUVIA) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the Covid vaccine. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in a public health clinic/veterans administration facility. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine dose 1 on 02Feb2021. The patient experienced nausea, chills, diarrhea and bad chest pain could barely breathe - these have passed. Her left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist and she has been alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain. She can barely lift her arm over her head. She also noticed an increase in her blood sugar and her blood was really dark - she stated this was unusual. She asked if there was anything she can do or take that might decrease her arm pain. All the adverse events happened on Feb2021 and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported that the patient had not recovered from all the adverse events at the time of the report. No treatment was received for all the adverse events, except for &#34;left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist&#34; (alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain). The patient has not been Covid-tested post vaccination.

                                                I am retired handicap-MS.  I was doing light housework.  I started getting pain in right lung,  over course of 2  hours  pain became very severe.  Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

                                                Patient reported to nurse after receiving first dose of Pfizer that 3-5 minutes later her left side of neck/throat felt tight and tingled. Nurse alerted Doctor and myself to assist patient. We arrived to patient&#39;s car in front of garage at 10:55 AM and walked beside car as the husband pulled forward to park. Patient stated she received her vaccine about 10:45 and then as her husband started pulling forward, she told him about her symptoms. Dr. assessed patient and stayed with patient until 11:13AM. Patient left in passenger seat with her husband driving stating that she no longer felt the tightness in her neck or throat.

                                                Immediately: headache, left eye pain, nausea, cold sensation and felt ?weird? but thought it was normal and thought I might feel flying for a bit but that it would wear off so I did not report feeling anything at the clinic. I left the clinic and got in the car to drive home and felt a weird feeling in my throat reminiscent of my esophageal spasm and then it felt like someone had their hand on my throat squeezing my throat and felt like I needed to take deep breaths to expand my lungs. Within a minute or two at most, my lips, tip of my tongue, tip of my nose and face beside my lips and under my cheeks started to tingle and go numb.  My insides felt swollen.   I had a doctors appointment and went there after picking my son up at home.  I reported my feeling to my doctor who prescribed a steroid for 3 days and told me to also take Benadryl or Claritin, which I did. However, today is day 4 after my vaccine and today is the first day my insides don?t hurt.

                                                About 50 minutes after the vaccine was given, my tongue began to swell and I experienced tightness in my throat and chest and shortness of breath. (This was occurring while I was driving myself home from the vaccination site.)  I administered my Epipen.  And I then drove myself to the Emergency Room, which is near my home.  At the ER, I was injected with cortisone, Benadryl, and Pepcid, and had my heart and blood pressure monitored for about 3 hours and then I was released, with a prescription for 50MG Prednisone (1q/day) and 10MG Pepcid (2q/day) x 5 days (for both scripts).  I finished the prescriptions, but am still feeling some discomfort in my throat and some dizziness.

Went to the emergency room and was stable at the time. Toward the latter part of the ER visit, I was given prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl. Have had no issues since then.

                                                Between 10 and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt like someone had thumped me in the chest over my left breast. I tried to breathe deeply, and I started to feel light headed. I didn&#39;t tell anyone, I was let go after 15 minutes. I sat in my car about 5 minutes and then decided I was worse. I was weak and shaky and light headed, my top lip was fuzzy feeling. I didn&#39;t feel like there was a blockage in my airway but I felt like I was having trouble getting my rib cage to expand so I could breathe. I went back in and was sat down, I was evaluated. Paramedics were called, by time they came I was lightheaded and I was foggy brained. I couldn&#39;t respond easily. My BP was 165/99 and my heart rate was 98. my O2 was fine but by that time I felt like I had to work hard to get a deep breath. I was feeling worse quickly. I was taken to the ER in a wheelchair. I was put in a bed and hooked me up to monitors. I was left alone for a while. When the dr came in he checked me out and listen to my lungs. I had a hard time getting my lungs to expand. Doctor ordered a blood sugar test and it was below 100. Chest x-ray, EKG and blood work. He told me later that everything was normal. I was there for 2 hours before I felt like I could go home. I didn&#39;t receive any medication. I was able to breathe easier by time I left the hospital. I was thinking more clearly as well. The next day I was still feeling shaky and weak. I went to my PCP on friday and I was feeling normal by then.

                                                at 3am I woke up with a racing heart rate and mild burning in my belly. I couldnt go back to sleep. The next day the burning in the belly got worse. My stomach became bloated and I was having shortness of breath walking short distances. The racing heart and chest pain ebbed and flowed.  I made a video appointment with my PCP group  on Thursday and they prescribed omeprazole and asked me to come in for physical exam the next day. When I went in the symptoms persisted, they did blood work, did a chest x-ray and sent me over to the emergency room. At the ER they did an EKG, more blood tests and recommended I have a abdominal CT on an outpatient basis. They couldnt say my symptoms were a result of the Pfizer shot but they could not rule it out that it was related to the shot.

She noted that her blood pressure was high as well. She tested it and it was over 180 sbp. She called me on the evening of 4/9/21 to let me know the chest and arm pain was getting worse. She told me her current systolic blood pressure was over 160 and she normally does not have elevated blood pressure. I advised her to go to the ER. She called the next day to let me know at the ER she found out that she had fluid around her lungs. They told her this was from her immune system&#39;s response from the vaccine.

After my 15 minute wait time before leaving, I told them my experience. They took my blood pressure which was 175 over something. They let me leave when it was down to 144 over something. Within a few  minutes after we left I experienced a severe hot flash, my air cutoff, and I felt weak/faint. I experiencedy airways close, then open again. Nothing like I have experienced before with an asthma attack. This was different. My husband pulled over and I was able to call 911. My heart was racing. The paramedics asked me about the rash on my chest which I new nothing about until he mentioned it. Said my face was flushed? And

                                                Patient received her second Pfizer covid vaccine on Tuesday 4/6/21. She said she had been doing yard work before she came to get her vaccine. After she received her vaccine she felt fine. On Tuesday night she started to feel some itchiness. She said the itchiness got worse over the next two days. She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine, the front of my neck developed a very itchy, warm rash, my lymph glands on the right side of my neck swelled so much that it was difficult to swallow even liquids without pain, and I had a fever of about 100. The itchy area on my neck continued to worsen, and despite the application of OTC anti-itch medications and me taking Benedryl, it got larger and warmer, and the itching became even more severe. At one point my throat was so swollen, I started to think it was closing up and that I&#39;d need to go to the hospital. The discomfort continued into the next day when I contacted Teledoc, and was prescribed an antibiotic, and prednisone, which helped. The itching is still present, but managed by regular spraying of an aerosol cortisone. And the swelling has gone, but there are slight scars like one would get from a scrape. My throat is much better, and my fever is gone.

I also began having problems breathing, began coughing and choking, chest pain, and dizziness.  The nursing staff at Hospital immediately got a wheelchair and rushed me next door to the ER.  The nurses had called ahead so that the ER doctors were ready to assist me.  I was given Epinephrine, steroids, nubilizer treatments, Bendryl, IV fluids and oxygen.  After some time I began feeling a little better but then the reaction restarted and treatments had to be re-administered several times.  It was quite frightening.  I also had a severe headache and tightness of the chest .  The ER doctor believed that I should be admitted which was done on 4/2/21 and was kept thru 4/4/21.

                                                DAY ONE  April 15, 2021. On Thursday April 15th at 10:00 a.m. I received the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine.   They gave me the shot in my left arm.  Within about 5 seconds, I started feeling nauseated and light headed like I was going to pass out.  I asked to just sit there for awhile because I did not feel stable to stand up and go to the waiting area.  I stayed seated for about 1-2 more minutes then the paramedics took me to the Medical area in a wheelchair.    The paramedics checked my vitals.  My blood pressure was 135 over ?? I don&#39;t remember.  I told the medic my BP is normally 98/58.   She said my BP was elevated.   My pulse was in the high 80&#39;s.  My temperature was 98.6 and my oxygen was 100.  I started getting pain and pressure going up the back of my neck, into my head, eyes and ears.  It was very painful and throbbing pressure.  I felt dizzy and really high.   It felt like I was floating on the top of the ceiling and the people were off in a distance.  I was really woozy.    I then got diarrhea.   The nausea continued but I did not throw up.  At times my thinking was spacey, so I talked to the paramedic to help me stay grounded.  I narrated what was happening in my body.  They did a glucose finger prick test because of my spaceyness, but it was normal.   It was like my whole system was freaking out.  I was there and then not there, feeling like I was floating.    These symptoms continued for about 90 minutes and getting worse.  The paramedics offered me to go to the hospital, but I thought eventually I would be fine.  I did not want to go to the hospital and have a huge medical bill.   At around 90 minutes, I started having pain in my heart left side, under my left breast on my left shoulder.  The paramedics did an EKG and did not find anything but some irregular heartbeats.  The heart beats felt like BA BOOM, then my heart would do a cartwheel.  BA BOOM and another cartwheel.    At this time, my husband arrived and took me to the hospital emergency room because the pain in my heart was getting worse.  I stayed in the hospital emergency room until around 5:00pm on April 15th. They did another EKG and some lab work and did not find anything but low thyroid.  I continued to feel drunk, nauseated, pain pressure and throbbing in my head neck, ears and eyes, diarrhea, and like I was High and going to pass out.    The chest pain in my heart was off and on.  It felt like muscle cramping in my heart, under my left breast and the left shoulder.  I also got a pain in my left groin area, then behind my left knee.  It was a sharp and throbbing pain for about an hour in each location, but eventually went away.    While in the Emergency room, they tried to give me Ativan.  I asked what it was for and they said Anxiety.  I said I wasn&#39;t anxious; I was just having a reaction to my first Covid 19 vaccine.  I said I did not want it because my body was already struggling to handle the Covid 19 vaccine.  They said the doctor prescribed it.  I said I had not seen a doctor, and they said it is protocol.  The nurse then came in and wanted to give me a shot for nausea and I said no, I don&#39;t want any more chemicals in my body, it is really having a hard time already with the Covid vaccine.    I went home, was wiped out, still feeling drunk/woozy/high, also nauseated, diarrhea, very dizzy, had a hard time walking.  The pain, throbbing in my head, neck, ears and eyes was still there.  By this time, I could not find clear thoughts, and could not make sense of things.   I was very agitated and at the same time exhausted and only wanted to sleep.    DAY TWO April 16, 2021 I woke up with a smashing head ache, neck ache, back ache and general feeling like Crap.  The nausea and diarrhea were still there and had woken me in the middle of the night.   I felt like a truck had hit me.  I stayed in bed all day and tried to eat and drink as much as I could.  I drank a lot of water that day.  I felt horrible, but was able to stand without feeling like I was going to fall over.  Had trouble finding clear thoughts at times.  Still felt out of it and had chest pain off and on.  Also had the BA BOOM heart beats and cartwheels in my heart.    DAY THREE  April 17, 2021 Very similar to day two.  I felt weak, nauseated, diarrhea, pain all over, jittery, not able to have clear thoughts at times.   It felt like my body was still on RED ALERT!!!    I also had very shallow breathing on day  2, 3, 4 and 5.  It tired me and I panted just getting up to go to the restroom.  I am able to eat fine and keep food down.  BA BOOM hear beats and cartwheels in my heart have lessened.    DAY FOUR April 18, 2021 I felt a little better and made the mistake of thinking I was getting over the reactions and did too much.  Shortness of breath.   DAY FIVE April 19, 2021 I feel horrible again, Nausea is really strong as well as the diarrhea.  I am feverish, sweaty and shaky.  Shortness of Breath. Tight in my chest. I just took my temperature and it is normal, although I am hot, sweaty, feel feverish and shaky.  I am exhausted.  The headache is still here as well as the pains in my neck, ears and eyes.   The aches in my body are still here.  I have no energy.  A wave of emotions is also here and I am weepy and crying.    This is no fun.   I am able to eat food OK and drink lots of water to counteract the diarrhea.    DAY SIX April 20, 2021 Shortness of breath, very tight in my chest, having to take Benadryl and use my rescue inhaler to keep my breathing open.   Feverish, chills, shakey, hot.   Temperature 97.0   Blood pressure 90/66 Pulse 70.  I feel like crap, just wiped out.

                                                severe allergic reaction to the vaccine; sore arm; neck pain; getting lots of saliva; tongue started swelling; rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing; heart rate it got faster; started getting confused; shaky; wheezing; swelling of her throat; blood pressure dropped; This is a spontaneous report form a contactable consumer reporting for herself.  A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 61-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Asthma, HBP, High Cholesterol, prediabetes. Known allergies: Penicillin, Sulfa, Peanuts. Concomitant medication(s) included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atenolol, chlortalidone (ATENOLOL/CHLORTHALIDONE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; metformin (METFORMIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; sertraline hydrochloride (SERTRAL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. No covid tested post vaccination. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reactions, tired, earache, swelling, itching, stinging, peeling, hurt my, throat was swelling, couldn&#39;t sleep, rash, burning, the neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse. It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (BNT162B2) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: TW0151) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer, pneumonia, pain in her lungs, smoker and arthritis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced what scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen on an unspecified date, problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored on 11Apr2021, arm hurt on 09Apr2021, pain in her back where her lungs are on 11Apr2021, hot and cold sweats on 10Apr2021, dizzy on 10Apr2021, shaky on 10Apr2021, nausea on 13Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders on 11Apr2021, out of it on 11Apr2021, weak on 10Apr2021, tired on 10Apr2021, headache on 10Apr2021, anxious on 10Apr2021, fever on 10Apr2021, itchy on 09Apr2021, feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen on an unspecified date, the pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs on an unspecified date, she has been sick on an unspecified date, her mental status was also affected on an unspecified date. Patient had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine on 09Apr2021 and gradually her arm hurt, she had hot sweats, she felt dizzy, was shaky, had nausea, and had body pain. The one thing she is concerned about was she had pain in her back where her lungs are and she was having problems breathing. She has a little bit of that still. She has also been out of it. Her breathing still almost feels labored, and this past weekend she thought she would go to the emergency room. Her main concern is this awful pain in her back while she was having problems breathing and getting enough oxygen. She felt weak, dizzy, and shaky. She got scared. She has been sick, she had cancer a long time ago. What scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen. The pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs. It goes directly from the front to the back. On Monday it started feeling better. Today it is so much better. She will feel like she is not getting enough oxygen or giving a full breath and then this in her back. She remembers having pneumonia years ago and having pain in her lungs. That&#39;s why she knows the pain is in the back of her lungs. She has to say she is a smoker. She slowed down and couldn&#39;t smoke this week or during that. She kind of quit, that&#39;s her reality now. The pain comes and goes throughout the day but it is not as bad. She didn&#39;t have this shortness of breath and other things until a couple days after she got the vaccine. It gradually came up on her. She was not having trouble breathing, it was more slightly labored. It was not profound, just there. Sometimes when she is speaking after a while she gets tired and will have to take a moment and take a deep breath. It is so much better. She called her primary care physician and was anxious, and all he said was she would feel effects for 2 weeks. He wasn&#39;t very helpful. Her arm hurt the day that she had the shot. Even today there are little bits of pain but very light. 09Apr2021 through 11Apr2021 was when everything really hit. It was hard to lift up her arm. It was a little pain, it was no big deal. She would have the AC on and blast it when she had the hot and cold sweats. She was using napkins because she was sweating profusely. It felt like she obviously had a reaction to the vaccine. It&#39;s normal she guesses. She didn&#39;t expect it for the first dose. The 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th it was really bad. Her whole body was sweating and would get wet. She&#39;d be hot and then cold. She was anxious because she was having problems breathing. She still gets a little bit of hot and cold sweats, but nothing compared to what she went through. As the days go on she is slowly getting better. She was dizzy not just during the day, at night she couldn&#39;t sleep because of it. She has gradually gotten better. Yesterday she tried to do some gardening but felt so weak she had to come back inside. When she gets up she feels weak and a little bit of lack of air. She has labored breathing. She was real itchy. The shakiness, dizziness, and anxiety all came on and were horrible. She doesn&#39;t know if the nausea was because she couldn&#39;t eat and had to take her regular medication. It was very light nausea. She had flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders. Her headache was major too during all of this. The headache is something that comes and goes still. It is a weird kind of headache. She had a fever and got like flu all over body pain. She doesn&#39;t know how to explain how she felt out of it. She doesn&#39;t know if it was the fact she was so sick. She had a feeling of did she do that. She couldn&#39;t make decisions. She would need to take the garbage out and go back to the garbage and think what did she come here for. Her mental status was also affected. The weakness gradually got really bad, and she still hasn&#39;t recovered from it. She still feels weak and tired when trying to do things. She was tired the day after she got the vaccine. The first day she thought it was nothing and she was fine. Gradually it got real bad when she was sick. She didn&#39;t feel that flu-ish feeling but was weak and tired. She got dizzy and she had the brain fog thing. She was having really bad headaches during the same time. The weakness and tiredness go hand in hand. She takes a mineral for her thoracic spine, but she takes that more for elderly arthritis. She doesn&#39;t have any conditions that she thinks played a role. She has been feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen. Took Tylenol for her fever. Mentioned fever would go away and come back. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 102, 99 and 100.1 (unit unspecified) all on unspecified dates.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever and itchy. Outcome of the event problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored, arm hurt, pain in her back where her lungs are, hot and cold sweats, dizzy, out of it and headache was recovering. Outcome of the event fever was recovered on 13Apr2021, itchy was recovered with sequelae on 14Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders was recovered on 16Apr2021, nausea was recovered on 16Apr2021, shaky was recovered on 19Apr2021. Outcome of the event weak and tired was not recovered. Outcome of all the other events was unknown.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 22Apr2021 12:10 (at the age of 61-year-old) as unknown single for COVID-19 immunization. This report was not related to a study or programme. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was first time had flu shot made her very ill, next year doctor suggested she should just have half of a shot instead of full shot to see if she tolerated it and she was able to tolerate that. She had not any other problems with flu vaccines in general. Some of the other vaccines, she was just supposed to take Benadryl with them because of some of the filler ingredients people put in things. She had previously had the 1 dose shingles vaccine, but she had gotten probably shingles probably a couple of months after that so they encouraged her to get the 2 part shingles vaccine at a later date and told her to do the pre-medicate routine like Benadryl day before, day of and at least 2 days after shingles vaccine doses and if any major problems call for help. She did not have a noticeable problem from the 2 part shingles vaccine. Some of the times depends on what filler ingredients people use. She was allergic to nutmeg which was used as an emollient oil or it&#39;s called Myristicin something or other oil; if something has too high a dose of mannitol it can cause a problem. She has a very long list of allergies and high sensitivities; if it was a high enough sensitivity it goes in allergies list, even though it may not be a true allergy. Family has lots of allergies. Regarding prescribed indication additional details: She had 3 doctors who initially advised her to get the vaccine including her primary care physician, oncologist and haematologist; this was because she was a high risk person because of various health issues. Her haematologist 2-3 months ago when she had her last appointment with him he was saying to get the shot and prescribed the epi-pen at that time; no one was having it yet, but he expected she would have some sort of reaction to it not able to be covered by Benadryl alone. Medical history included ongoing platelet disorder Verbatim: Unidentified platelet disorder, Lots of allergies, cardiac murmur, ongoing asthma, osteoarthritis, glucose tolerance impaired, hypoglycaemia slow thyroid and back and neck pain. Concomitant medication(s) included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for hypersensitivity (50mg taken as needed), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for hypersensitivity (10mg daily), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma (250/50 twice daily), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism (137mcg-1 tablet daily), methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) (20mg tablet twice daily), salsalate, colestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT) (2-500mg tablets 3 times daily), sucralfate (CARAFATE) (1mg tablet 4 times daily-dosage verified with caller as milligrams and captured as provided), loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]) (2.5/0.25 takes 2 tablets of that 4 times daily), calcium carbonate (CALCIUM OYSTER SHELL [CALCIUM CARBONATE]) (Alternates dose of 500mg and 1000mg on days takes Vitamin D), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) (250 mg), vitamin D (50,000 units every other day taken), vitamin B12 (1mg injection every 14 days), clonazepam (KLONOPIN) (2-1mg tablets at bedtime), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma (10mg tablets at bedtime) and cefixime (FLEXERIL [CEFIXIME]) taken for back pain, neck pain (10mg tablets 3 times daily as needed). On 22Apr2021, Onset time: She had a note saying her eyes itchy at 12:20, but they were itching before that because she waited long enough to report it; so onset time was less than 10 minutes when her eyes started itching. Then her pulse; she could feel chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard. They did check her pulse while she was in their initial observation and her pulse was only in the 70s, but oxygenation was at 96%.When at doctors office less than 1 hour before that reading, oxygenation was at 98%.Recorded at 12:30 eyes itching much worse, throat felt like it was starting to tighten, heart felt like it was starting to race. By 12:50 hands were starting to swell. She had already been pre-medicated with Benadryl before this before she went down to get the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, she had Benadryl in her system. She had that same morning with her morning meds had taken Zyrtec and Benadryl in anticipation of getting the possibility of getting the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine because she has to pre-medicate for vaccines just in case she starts to react in anyway. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines was not administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Emergency Room taken from the location where vaccine administered-they gave her Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot had her sit for basic observation then sit for extended observation. In that time period telling them her symptoms were going on, increasing. They gave her another 50mg Benadryl even though she had already had 1 before and then called emergency room, took her down, left her in waiting area even though she had heart and chest palpitations. Physician Office seen prior to event on 20Apr2021, seen after event 27Apr2021. Primary Care Physician didn&#39;t hear anything in lungs either visit. Not admitted to hospital; seen in emergency room, theoretically she got treated; however her basic blood pressure and stuff even with what they were doing was higher than when she was triaged in the ER; blood pressure was up and something else,oxygenation level moderately reduced from when she came down to when she was just let go; however her symptoms were worse when she was leaving than when she got there. She knows what they gave her while she was there was IV of normal saline, solumedrol and IV Benadryl. Thinks they later gave her Tylenol tablets. Finally got them to do an EKG because kept saying her chest was getting worse but that was several hours after she was back there even though came there having chest pains. In her opinion this hospital was not taking reaction seriously. Not admitted to hospital even though symptoms were worse and blood pressure higher on discharge, well above her normal levels. Currently trying to get them to explain why they took so long to do anything for her. Finally did a chest x-ray on 22Apr2021:discharge papers say abnormal x-ray and they gave a couple of different possibilities as to what that might be so Primary Care Physician wrote a prescription to get a follow-up chest x-ray to make sure that everything is fine and back to normal and not ongoing or progressing or anything because they gave some strange things: what their impressions were: findings: there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. It says the left lung appears clear; cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits; impression restates non specific right findings there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. This was from front and lateral views of the chest x-ray at 19:00pm 22Apr2021. 2 ECGs: She guesses this is what they call EKG not, relevant point is that in the notes there for the records: Says abnormal ECG compared with blah blah blah, hard to find when exactly they wrote this, trying to get the exact wording for each of the two. Machine results CED, which caller explained is what they call themselves now instead of ER, notes for MD interpretation; one done at 17:53 , other at 21:32. They both say there was slightly different readings, however both say abnormal ECG. One of the wordings that is in both. She had no further details to provide regarding relevant testing/investigations. She had to be in the ER back in the room for several hours before they would do the EKG and that&#39;s only because she said I have chest pain and standard procedure is to do an EKG, had been back there for hours, they had done no tests, the only thing they did was basic blood panel, had not done a troponin or heart enzymes test, had not done EKG that&#39;s why she knows they were not taking her seriously at all; if someone says chest pains and you don&#39;t do anything in the standard protocol they are not taking you seriously. On this Monday, 2 days ago she had gone down to pick up the records from the ER to go to Primary Care Physician appointment 27Apr2021, finally actually got to speak to someone who said they would get back to her on 27Apr2021 to look into why the EKG tests were not done for someone having chest pains. That&#39;s one of the first things you do for someone having chest pain, no matter what the source. Frustrated with them because they&#39;re still not communicating back, they had not taken her seriously while she was there; unknown if they were actually going to be reporting, as they were still trying to convince her to get the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. If she reacted to the first dose in first 10 minutes, second dose could be much more of a reaction. With the amount of anti-histamines in her system with Benadryl and Zyrtec and she was still starting to react in under 10 minutes. It&#39;s possible to be one of the inactive ingredients but she doesn&#39;t see anything in the pamphlet provided that she could identify at first glance as being the culprit to the problem other than 2 possibilities: potassium chloride and other is monobasic potassium phosphate. There is a possibility of her having a reaction to those because she was known to react to certain potassium products; sometimes it was the inactive ingredients. She definitely would have wanted to get the second part of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine series until after she was not getting the medical attention she needed after reaction to the first dose. Because ideally you&#39;re supposed to have it at the same location, that just made her very nervous at the prospect of worse reaction at location that did not take her serious the first time. She was a big fan of Pfizer thought they do a great job; she had not known it was a 2 parter, not that it should make much difference. When her Primary Care Physician was saying second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was out of the question and she had been saying to people that she did not think it would be prudent to take the second part, they kept trying to say oh you need to get the second part, talk to so and so so they can convince you to get it, and doctor is going no. She reacted to ringers lactate or lactated ringers whatever the name is, her retired nurse sister sat and watched her getting some ringers lactate prior to surgery for her tear duct and saw her starting to break out in red splotches, patient said she was itching. Action taken in response to the events was drug withdrawn. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Numerous blood clots in both lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient reported for herself). A 61-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8730, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 09Apr2021 09:00 AM as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, migraines, known allergies to tape and anise allergy. The patient had negative nasal swab on 07Nov2020.

The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 30Apr2021 09:00 AM, patient had numerous blood clots in both lungs. On 01May2021 to May2021, she was admitted to the hospital for 2 days with numerous blood clots in both lungs. After several tests (May2021), they could not find any reason for getting these clots. So, thinking the only other thing patient did different was get the covid vaccine.

It resulted to emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

The dyspnea was the most concerning. The body aches settled into my lower back. Fatigue was moderate-moderately severe.  As the day went on things waxed and waned.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

                                                I had to get cleared by a allergist prior to getting the vaccine due to my prior history allergy history. I was advised by the allergist to take Allegra an hour before receiving the vaccine. About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I started to throat my started to feel dry and tickling, it felt like it swelling starting from the left side to the center, I started having difficulties swallowing my salvia and any fluid. My blood pressure was checked and it was elevated.  I started to have difficulty breathing. They transferred me over to the ER. They gave me IV medicines Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid (I think). After 6 hours I was able to go home. Everything went back to normal besides the pain in the left arm at injection site.   I had a telemedicine visit today with my primary care physician to follow up.

                                                On 1/8/2021 2 days after I received the Covid vaccine I started to have SOB and coughing. I started to used my inhalers and it would give some relief but I was using it more than normal. I had not had asthma attack for more than a year. My asthma is very controlled that I don&#39;t use any inhalers whether daily or as needed. I went to work as usual since at that time my symptoms weren&#39;t getting worse but also not getting better. On 1/19/21, I was feeling more out of breath and having more dry hacking cough that when I called EH I was told to do the Covid testing. That same day I called my Asthma doctor and did a video call and was prescribed Breo inhaler, spiriva inhaler, xoponex nebulizer treatment and xoponex rescue inhaler. I couldn&#39;t go to work because of my shortness of breath and coughing. The treatment didn&#39;t work. On Tuesday 1/26/21, I called my asthma doctor again and another video call was made. She changed my inhaler to symbicort, still continue spirirva inhaler and nebulizer treatment. I also contacted my primary doctor who asked that I schedule an appointment with him so he can see me. On 1/28/21, I saw my primary doctor who did blood works to see if I have any blood clot and to see how my heart was doing. I was given phenergan with codeine to help with my coughing and it did help me to go to sleep. My blood works came out negative and he ordered CAT scan of my chest since I can&#39;t get rid of my SOB and coughing. I had the CAT scan on 2/3/21. He called me the next day and I was told that I had mucous plugging. He told me to go home and he prescribed Duoneb nebulizer treatment 4x a day and spiriva inhalers 2x a day. I started to get rid of the mucous that I had and started to breath better. It took 4 days of 4x a day nebulizer treatment and inhalers before I started to feel

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

I remember someone telling me to sit down and eat something.  (I had already had lunch and a snack).  That evening I started to have a bad headache. Thursday morning I had a very difficult time getting up and was extremely fatigued; felt hot. I felt exhausted all day and looked pretty tired and pale. Friday morning still tired, had some bouts of energy, but they didn&#39;t last long. Body aches were worse and I also had some stomach discomfort Saturday felt like I had a sore throat, felt weak, and still pretty tired.  I had some problems catching my breath when climbing stair and  and at one point felt hot and clammy.  Headache was better.

At minute 27 she started getting swelling and redness of her lips and face slightly. She normally takes Benadryl when this happens so gave her a Benadryl 50mg one dose. Her throat then became tight in a few minutes and she said that she needed an epipen because she was starting to have a little bit of trouble breathing. Gave epipen and her symptoms resolved within a few minutes. Kept her for 15 minutes. She stated that she knew she would be ok and asked if she could leave. I stated she needed to see the ER if she had any more trouble. I also consulted with her to check with her doctor about getting the 2nd dose because more than likely it&#39;s not recommended.

Medical history included lung and back problems (back pain). It was reported that the patient normally took an inhaler (not steroid inhaler because she didn&#39;t want to interfere with immune response), and other things.

The patient received the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE (Lot# not provided) on 29Jan2021 (at the age of 62-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s 2nd dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE was administered a week ago (Feb2021) Friday. It was reported that she got very ill initially which she said joint pain in hands and headache noted in Feb2021 (Saturday) which wasn&#39;t so bad. On Saturday afternoon, she reported shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and described a feeling of bugs crawling in her lungs, bugs front and back, and itching, and no one else reported it. The patient kept sleeping and waking up, thinking she was alright, but the coughing and lasted until Sunday evening, it was a very painful cough, and a creeping sensation in lungs front and back. She missed work on Monday. The events (joint pain in hands, headache, shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and itching) were medically significant as she was unable to go to work. It was also mentioned that since the patient stopped taking the Prednisone 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had an exacerbation of pain (it came back). The patient was also wondering when can she start the inhaler and steroid for the back as she has lung and back problems. Outcome of the events were unknown.   Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on data provided, the reported events are assessed as possibly related to BNT162B2.

I stayed home from work the next day and my fever was 100.0. Tylenol helped. I felt tired but better. It became difficult to breath. It felt like I had chest pains especially on exertion.

Positive test results on 01/11/2021.

I still have some chest heaviness and still having asthma issues which includes coughing.  I also had side effects of sore arm, chills, fatigue.  Did not seek treatment.  I had no idea how long this would last.  I wish I would have read the paperwork for severe allergic reaction, but I didn&#39;t. I would have gone to the ER.  I have suffered with this since Saturday.

Given 5o mg of diphenhydramine and albuterol inhaler, then transferred to ED.  Per ED note: &#34;Her main complaint to me was feeling of swelling in her throat. I do not see objective evidence of this on exam, she is not in respiratory distress, thus epinephrine was held. She was given IV methylprednisolone and famotidine, already received benadryl. After about 10 minutes she started to feel better and her symptoms resolved in ED. Tryptase and C4 sent per protocol (within normal limits). She was observed for 5 hours with no recurrence of symptoms and was discharged with a prednisone burst x 4 days. I recommended she take benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 24 hours and then as needed after. She already has an epi pen.&#34;

Very tired . Tired enough that I accidentally  left the house for a job interview wearing one white sock and one black sock. Which isn&#39;t normal for me. 3rd day: muscle aches. 4th days feels like a really mild virus.   This is not me but another person from  my former job said she had spontaneous canker sores from the Pfizer shot.

I was positive for Covid in March 2020, the symptoms I experienced were very similar to the symptoms that i had when I had Covid back in March 2020.  At the hospital, EKG, echo stress test and cardiac enzyme tests were performed. I was prescribes an albuterol advent inhaler and started on blood pressure medication.

I tried to take 2 puffs of my ProAir inhaler, this did nothing to help the SOB. Within the hour I could not get a full breath at all. the chest pain was only tolerable if I was leaning forward. My husband took me to the ER. They did testing and found that I had Pericarditis and Pleuritis. They informed me that I should NOT get any further COVID vaccines because it could kill me.

                                                The expected soreness in my arm developed throughout the afternoon of the morning (Friday) I had the shot along with a fever. I had fever and chills all night - my teeth chattered all night. The fever continued throughout Saturday and my nose was congested. My chest felt tight. Of most concern my neck was so stiff Saturday and Sunday that I could not move it or turn it in the slightest. The pain radiated down through the shoulders but no further. The overwhelming fatigue I had felt when I had Covid in late March-early April was back. I could not stand long without having to sit down and walking around made me feel breathless. I stayed in bed all weekend. The fever broke Sunday night and by Monday morning I could move my neck,  but it was very tender and I did not have my normal range of motion. My congestion turned into a runny nose on Monday which cleared on Tuesday. By Tuesday my energy level was close to normal and I had full range of neck motion, although still tender. I never had a headache at any point over those four days.

We asked if she was okay, if she needed anything or if we needed to call ems. Husband states she is fine and looks at pt she said she was fine and while we were confiming she didn&#39;t need anything pt was passing out again. We gave her a bottled water, a wet paper towel and called 911. Once ems arrived they checked her out, asked her if she wanted help getting to the car and her husband to take  her home when she started gasping for air so ems took her on the hospital.

A 62-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration administered on right arm on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 62-year-old) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Allergies with This was under control, ongoing asthma with This was under control, meniere&#39;s disease from 1989 and ongoing with This was under control, have 2 broken knees. Patient knows how to control this condition, she didn&#39;t need Prednisone prior to onset of these adverse events, Low immune system with She has an immune deficiency so her immune system very low, like 300., Respiratory illness, Genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, Endocrine abnormalities with endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. Family Medical History Relevant to AE reported as None.  History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect reported as Both doses of product documented in Pfizer Suspect Vaccine and Vaccination fields. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect reported as None. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207; Expiry date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration to the right arm on 13Mar2021 at 13:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine other than dose 1 of 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions patient reported none other than just her inhalers which doses of had to be increased in response to symptoms after first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Concomitant medication included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) taken as Dose increased to twice in the morning daily for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing, (Lot number: 0014678, ; Expiration Date: Jan20230); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) 500 taken as Dose increased from once daily to twice daily an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride (Lot Number: 3N2E, Expiration Date: Feb2022), fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing (Lot number: GA00510, Expiration date: May2022); prednisone (PREDNISONE) taken for an unspecified indication with quantity of 27, Dose: 3-20mg daily for 7 days, then 2-20mg daily for 2 days, then 1-20mg daily for 3 days and Ongoing therapy. She also used a nose spray that didn&#39;t work so they switched her back to Dymista nose spray.   Consumer stated that she received both doses of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had reactions to both of them. Consumer stated that, &#34;The second dose was even worse. They put her on Prednisone. She did not know if she should be tested again or not? She was sitting up but she could not walk around anywhere. She had 2 broken knees. She could not walk anywhere. After the second dose, they had to bring her to the hospital because she couldn&#39;t even walk to her car. She got home and she had been sick ever since. She had allergies too. She could not do anything. she had a hard time breathing. she was hesitant to get the 2nd one, but everybody said to get it. Her IgG level was down to 300 something. She was also tapering off of prednisone and she did not want to be tapering off it because it was worked well for her. She could tell by her breathing that it was helped her. She could taste sodium in her mouth constantly since she had got the vaccination.&#34; Second dose completed her prescribed therapy. Dates for Symptoms From 15Mar2021 to Ongoing Reported seriousness for Symptoms reported as Unspecified and the Symptoms was reported as worsened. Patient&#39;s doctor dropped her last week, told her she didn&#39;t know what to do with her, and that this was too stressful.  Onset of symptoms following first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine was on 17Mar2021. She couldn&#39;t breathe very well when she went in for the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She was ok the first day after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, seemed ok, arm didn&#39;t hurt; but then had onset of symptoms. She has been in bed the whole time since onset of symptoms, was in bed for over 2 weeks. She slept for 2 days straight, only got up for water and the bathroom. It was bad, getting hard to breathe. She had to use her emergency inhaler. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine messed up her Meniere&#39;s disease. Doctor started patient on Prednisone for these symptoms, and Prednisone is really the only thing that clears up Meniere&#39;s disease because her ears was full and she could not get up. Prednisone helped her and I relayed in her &#39;rescue&#39; inhalers (treatment) because she did 2 in the morning, two inhalers anyway when she started to feel better, she got her second one and it made her worst.  She did not eat anything salty or anything, the barometric pressure was not bad. It was really funny because she had just finished everything and it was a few days before she had to go get her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine shot. She was just starting to feel normal, at least normal for her, she could get up normal and drive. They gave her the second shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and it was like a double. She clarified as she got like double the amount of symptoms that she had experienced following the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  She is tasting sodium in her mouth from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She can&#39;t have much sodium which struck up the Meniere&#39;s disease really bad the second day after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine; her allergies in her head went bonkers. She could not talk, it was closing up her throat, she was coughing every time she eats or dinks, and she&#39;s having a &#34;really bad&#34; adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the second dose. They had to take her out of the hospital to her car in a wheelchair &#34;right after&#34; getting the second shot. She could not get more than 1000 mg of sodium a day, she tastes it in her mouth constantly, she could not get rid of it and it was &#34;going through her system&#34;. She wanted to know what to do, since her doctor told her to contact Pfizer. She wanted to know what part of the vaccine is doing that, she assures it is sodium, because sodium is in her mouth 24/7 and she could not get it out, she could not have that much sodium in her body. It was still getting really hard to breathe. She is still taking the Prednisone she was initially prescribed and started on for the symptoms that started after her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She is tapering off of Prednisone, and she shouldn&#39;t be tapering off, she thinks she needs to be Prednisone for some more days, maybe 3 more days, then she would be ok. It was prescribed as a 7-day burst of Prednisone. She mentioned that the only Prednisone that works on her is the Actavis manufactured Prednisone; her pharmacy orders it for her because they know that. She called the emergency room Saturday when she was really bad. They said they had a line there and it was going to be at least a 4 hour wait. With patient&#39;s low immune system, Meniere&#39;s disease and that she could hardly breathe she did not go to the emergency room because she could catch something and die while waiting. She decided she would just stay at home and rest. She has not had any Physician&#39;s office visit relative to event; she has a telephone appointment tomorrow to see if the doctor is going to be her doctor. She had to cancel her appointment with the doctor today because if she has something she doesn&#39;t want to spread it, she feels worse now and with the Meniere&#39;s she is tasting sodium in her mouth constantly from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, she does not eat a lot of salt. The flu shot takes her a couple of days, then she is right back up and Vaccination Last dose on Oct2020. Consumer stated that she has &#39;Meniere&#39;s&#39; disease (History) and it made her worse. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG level: 300. Reporter stated the seriousness for the events was Unspecified. Seriousness of event Meniere&#39;s disease aggravated was medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                She got the vaccine, she&#39;s healthy.  Within minutes they took her VS and showed no signs of anything happening at that point.   She had a care ride.   At approximately 4:00 PM the EMS was at the facility,  she could not breath or talk and EMS was called and it got worse in the ride to the ER.   She had a severe  headache to the point that somebody grabbed her around the throat and her eyes were popping out of her head.  She had chest pains, and given nitro for that, and had trouble breathing.  She had no voice.  The attempted to give her aspirin in applesauce.  Her temp was taken and it was 97, by the time she was admitted it was elevated.  In the car, EMS was trying to get her veins and 11 attempts were made and she was bruised.   She has waited a year and a half for surgery as she needs right knee replacement, and has spine, joint issues and was not able to move due to extreme weakness.  She was given Epinephrine in her leg and it did not do anything.  She was admitted to the hospital and was there a couple of days until she was able to help her walk.  She had no anxiety and had anger over the nursing staff, attending physician and the way she was treated.  She is a licensed CNA and has worked in 3 hospitals and has a grievance due to the lack of care that she received while in the hospital.  The ER nurses were good, but going to the 6th floor was another issue.     Her Dr. on Saturday ordered a swallow test as they could not determine why she had no voice and could not swallow.  It was done and she was still having difficulty getting food down, but it was slow and did go down.  Since he has been back at ALF she is now better, able to walk, talk and go about her life.   While in the hospital she was having a hard time getting her medications, and was given a breathing treatment in the ER, and was still having problems on the floor and was having problems with them getting her medications so that she could breath.  She finally got their attention and told her that she was not okay with her and the lack of the nursing staff care.   She fought to get her Flonase, and by the time she was ready to leave on Saturday she had been given one treatment of Symbicort.    She did have blood tests done to the point that it was excessive, but she had veins that were blowing and there was no access points.  On Friday she refused them as she had been stuck 11 times.  On Saturday morning they came to get more blood and she refused on Saturday evening when she was being discharged, and she was prescribed a multivitamin to take, which she has never taken one before.    She has no heart issues and no chest pains but was discharged home with nitroglycerin.   She states that she will not be getting the 2nd vaccine.

                                                She got her vaccine, and immediately had a sodium taste in her mouth.  She has weakness, very hard to breath, her face was swelling and her lymph nodes were swollen, and the sodium taste is getting worse and she can&#39;t get it out of her mouth.  Her Meniere&#39;s medicine is not helping at all, and she is not able to drive.  She is really weak and went to the ER twice and they did some chest X-rays that were fine.  They took blood and told her that her sodium was fine, and she feels that was wrong it should be low.  She has a lot of problems with sodium.  The 2nd time she went they did nothing, gave her a nebulous treatment and she could not do that as her throat was swelling up and has had a sore throat since that visit and that breathing treatment.  They told her that it was something like her inhaler, and didn&#39;t give her anything else.  She was then discharged after 3 hours.  She is too weak to walk so is in a wheelchair.  She is dead tired and has extreme weakness, and the salt taste in her mouth is BAD.  The breathing is real bad, and so is the dizziness which is making her Meniere&#39;s bad and all she wants to do is sleep from being so tired.    She has two bad knees and is able to walk, but due to the pain she has been using a wheelchair.  She has an APT on Tuesday with a pulmonary specialist.

                                                She got her vaccine and within 10 minutes she felt like her heart did a big woosh and was sitting with her husband and told him that it was hitting her blood stream as she had not had the reaction since starting some medication due to lupus.  The first hour it was fairly overwhelming wooshing sensation that made her feel uncomfortable and restless, and then got less.  Over the course of the week it continued to happen and did not feel right.  She called her PCP and by the time she got to see him  on 5/20/21 it had been a month, but had not worsened to go to the ER.  She had an EKG that showed acquired long QT syndrome, and told her that she could not get the 2nd vaccine.   He said that if she got hte 2nd vaccine that there was a likelihood that she would develop Torsades de pointes and that it could be life threatening.  Now he has to be careful on what to treat her due to this condition.   He told her to take really good care of herself and to continue take her medications and if it got worse to go to the ER.  She will FU with him in a month and he would continue to check EKG&#39;s to see if it will go away or not.   She is more tired and if she goes up and down the steps she is out of breath much quicker than before this condition.  She had several  normal EKG&#39;s in the past that he compared the last one with and she did not have this condition on previous EKG&#39;s.    She wishes that they would put out information for people who have autoimmune issues to publish these reactions to be watchful of reactions.  Feels they need to update the website to report similar side effects.

                                                She got her vaccine in the left arm, and felt fine.  She went shopping in the store and noticed that she was short winded when she was leaving, but felt that it was possibly asthma and left.   She had a temperature between 102 and 103 for a couple of days and having fever and chills as well.  She continued with the shortness windedness, and had company and on 5/9/21 they left and she started having severe pain, felt like it was either on the right side kidney or the lung, and was spasming horribly and knocking her down with the pain.  She went to the ER and they did a CAT Scan thinking it was kidney stones, but told her that she had three blood clots in her lungs, lower base right and lower base left and mid right and part of her lung has apparently died due to this.  They put her on blood thinners, Xarelto.   She was admitted on 5/10 early morning and released on 5/12/21.  The doctor in the hospital said that it did not make sense that she had blood clots in her lungs, but nothing in her legs.  She told her that she was short winded, and he told her to report her reaction.  Since being home she has been coughing a lot due to possibly the blood clots.  She was told that she will be on the Xarelto for a very long time.  She was also informed that she had lymph node enlargement as well.

A 62 year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 23Apr2021 11:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing GERD (has had this since her injuries, so about 10 or 11 years), ongoing asthma (she was diagnosed with this probably 15 years ago on the job), ongoing Bi-valve of her aorta, it is a leaky valve diagnosed in 1994, multiple injuries (sustained on the job; had accidents and different things, and surgeries too; injuries were cumulative over 22 years on the job), bronchitis (started because she had pneumonia in 1996 then any respiration issue turned into bronchitis; has had repeated bronchitis over the past 17 years; been using her inhaler), environmental allergies, adverse reactions to opioids and pain medicine, LS fusion in 2010, CS fusion in 2012, left shoulder surgery in 2012, gallbladder removal in 2016, total hysterectomy in 2005, tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy in 1977. She had no relevant family medical history. Concomitant medications included montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for allergies from 2006 and ongoing; fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for asthma from 2016 and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for hypersensitivity from 2016 and ongoing; dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) taken for indigestion from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (FLEXERIL) taken for pain and muscle relaxant for multiple injuries from her job from 2013 and ongoing; and ibuprofen (ADVIL) taken for pain and aches from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Patient previously received amoxicillin and was allergic. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She was not sick at the time of vaccination and that she was unbelievably healthy. In the early evening of 10May2021, the patient experienced severe sore throat that was persistent to worsening. In the evening of 11May2021, she experienced coughing and congestion. On 12May2021, the patient had low pulse ox reading and she was feeling crappy. Her pulse ox has not gotten above 95% since last night and that it was 93% at the time of report. It occurred late last night and hasn&#39;t gone up. She checks it every night. Pulse oximetry taken around 22:00 on 12May2021 was 93%. Patient said she knew this from over the years she&#39;s had bronchitis. She also reported worsened difficulty breathing in the morning, sneezing and coughing was so severe that it made her pee. It occurred in the morning and she  had to change her jammies. It happens when the coughing and sneezing was severe. She thinks the congestion was causing the coughing. She was lethargic a few days after the first dose; she felt crappy. She was so tired and she wondered if her immune system dumped and that&#39;s why she got sick. She says the lethargic feeling occurred mid morning a few days after the first dose, but exact date was unknown, then clarified she does not know if event started one or two days after the shot. She could not find the NDC number, LOT number, or expiration date on her vaccination card. She called her lung doctor and couldn&#39;t get in. She will be calling her primary because they weren&#39;t open yet. When asked if the events required a visit to the Emergency Room, the patient said &#34;no, not yet.&#34; She confirmed that her next dose was on Friday 14May2021, and mentioned: I lost my days-further details not provided. Patient wanted to ask if she should proceed with that schedule despite how she&#39;s feeling. Outcome of severe sore throat was unknown, and of remaining events was not recovered.  Information about the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                I have just been fitted for a CPAPand have been using it for 11 days with no ill effects. Last night at roughly 3:15 am I woke up because I was having difficulties breathing. I had trouble on the inhale but the worse part was not being able to exhale with the CPAP on.  I could only exhale through the mouth. I had to take the CPAP off so as I could breath. I also got out of bed to get in a sitting position.  At this point my breathing seemed somewhat ok.  About 30 minutes later I took my blood pressure and pulse.  BP was 123 over 70 and my pulse was 70.

The patient experienced tinnitus, sinus infection, and stuffy head after the first dose. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks and no other medications were taken within 2 weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. On 08Jan2021, after the 2nd dose, the patient experienced itching across shoulders/back of neck and sl nausea. She took Benadryl which relieved the itching. She went to bed and had onset of body aches, chills, and sense the she couldn&#39;t get a good breath. She felt like there was a tight band around chest. Her O2 Sat was 95% - 98%, with pulse of 101-129, T max was 101.8. The symptoms were lasting about 6 hours. In the morning, the patient took Aleve and Benadryl. Most symptoms were alleviated. She took those meds scheduled for 48 hrs. She noticed that if she tried to push past scheduled time, the itching started to return, so she just kept the meds scheduled for 48 hours. No other symptoms after that. She added that she had tinnitus, and she noticed that both injections made that worse. It was not yet subsiding since last injection. The patient also received Tylenol for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021.

(Patient stated shortness of breath was another symptom that she had from COVID and is continuing somewhat especially when I was a mask for work -  but had not put it in the first report). Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

                                                No issues during 15 minute observation period after receiving the vaccine. So I left the facility to go to my car. Then about 15 minutes later my  face started to get really hot with  slight swelling. Then after several more minutes throat became tight and started to experience extreme  difficulty swallowing.   I was still in the parking lot so I immediately went back inside to the vaccination area asking for help.  I did not experience any breathing difficulties during the entire time but did experience extreme difficulty with swallowing and throat tightening.   The staff did the usual  checks. I was not too awarre of all the things they did but I was given a benedryl tablet which I was able to swallow thankfully. I was told my vitals were very high.  Not sure of exact times but sometime shortly after the benedryl things started to fell better.  The throat/swallowing started to get better.  Face burning started to cool.  Stayed in this area for about 20 or 30 more minutes and then told I could go with a comment that I should see my doctor about my high blood pressure.  Which I explained I do not have high blood pressure and when checked later in the day it was back to my usual 115 - 125 range .  I was concerned about getting the second shot later and was told to take a benedryl either just before I get the next shot or right after.??????   After checking the online cdc guidelines that does not jive at all.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

                                                When I first got it, I felt okay, but as I was walking out, I felt disoriented and had to sit down. I was very lightheaded and uneasy. I stayed about an hour because I was scared to drive. I later got chills and fever for about 24 hours.  I eventually developed shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, tightness in my throat, bruising in my legs and painful lymph nodes in my neck and arms. One day, I felt like I was having a mini-stroke. It only lasted for a brief period and then went away. That has occurred multiple times. My doctor thinks some of my issues were due to anxiety, but I don&#39;t agree because I&#39;m fine now.

                                                I started coughing for about an hour around 10pm while I was on a phone call;  then developed a fuzziness in my throat and felt like I had mucus in my chest. I took 120 mg  Allegra. I started to feel relief after about 10 minutes.  I had to relieve my throat of mucus this morning.  Other than muscular aches, especially at the site of the vaccine and behind my shoulder, I am ok. About 10 - 11 hours after my first vaccine on 2/26/2021, I developed a similar reaction, however much milder, and took Allegra, which relieved the symptoms.

I hope this is just my frequent bronchial response to allergens, but given the proximity to the vac I am reporting. I added guafinessan every four hours at 9 a.m. on March 28, 2021, and am taking it every four hours. It is not lasting a full four hours. I plan to add albuterol, which I have for PRN usage.

They took my vitals and then gave me an epi shot, connected an IV with steroids and antihistamines. They called an ambulance and I was transferred to the ER of the nearest hospital. The doctor administered more  prednisone and antihistamines. I was released after about 5 hours. Got prescriptions for prednisone,  antihistamines and an epi pen. I am still experiencing redness, headache, nausea,  chills , mild shortness of breath today.

I noted that the patient coughed as she exited the vaccine area to the observation area that was manned by a Registered Nurse.  The RN came to the vaccine area to ask me to help with the patient while she waited in the lobby with another RN.  The patient was sitting in a chair, flushed, distressed, experiencing shortness of breath and repeatedly coughing.  EMS was already called.  I pulled up 0.3mg of epinephrine which was administered IM in the right lateral thigh and 25mg of diphenhydramine 25mg which was administered IM into the upper left deltoid, the opposite arm from the vaccination.  EMS arrived and took the patient to the emergency room approx. 1 mile from the clinic.  She received methylprednisolone 125mg IV, famotidine 20mg IV, and nebulized race-epinephrine upon arrival.  She was discharged home with prescriptions for prednisone 20mg daily x 5 days and an Epipen.

She went numb around the mouth and lips and her throat felt like it was closing up and itchy.  She was able to breath ok and took Benadryl for a couple of days and then had a really bad rash, small that covered her entire chest, stomach and back, but they were little prickly-heat looking rash.  The rash cleared after 5 days of taking the Benadryl.  She was also taking a steroid cream at that time that she had been given by a dermatologist in the past.   She called her doctor and informed him of the reaction and he informed her that she should not take the 2nd vaccine due to her reaction unless she felt that maybe something else triggered the reaction.

                                                First day a little sore arm,(Monday)  The second day was BAD.(Tuesday)  As the day went on it got worse.  That evening I did not sleep all night.  I was having very intense throbbing pain from my wrist, up my right arm (same arm as the shot was given), up the right side of my neck, pain down my right side of my back and into my lung area.  The pain just spread until it was on a scale of 1-10 it was an 11.  It also spread to my lower back.  The next day,( Wednesday) I still had all of the pain.  Thursday I just have soreness in my upper shoulder blade area.  This was very scary!  I even took some aspirin incase of blood clotting.  Tylenol did nothing.  If I would  have had a very strong pain pill I would have taken it.  Now I am afraid to get my second shot which is scheduled for April 26th.  I need some guidance from you on this.

Concomitant medications included benzonatate at 100 mg to help her breathe, azithromycin (six pills of that, 200mg, two one day and one pill a day until gone) for pneumonia. Patient had her second dose scheduled on 12Apr2021. She explained after the shot, her &#34;arm was sore and achy&#34; she said she also had &#34;pain&#34;. She added she experienced &#34;flu-like symptoms&#34;. She specified these adverse reactions are all gone now but her arm is still &#34;a little sore&#34; and she has one area with a &#34;big circle around it and it&#39;s hard&#34;. She said it could be &#34;swelling&#34;. She asked if her reaction was reported as side effects to the vaccine. She expressed being in a rush and is expecting her daughter soon and asked us to be quick. She said she will also consult with her HCP this afternoon. Patient stated she had the first shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and today and last night the site was red, but today in that area she has gotten a big circle around it and its hard. Patient stated she&#39;s had it before with shots and just wanted to make, sometimes she has had to be put on medicine for it, wanted to be sure its healing because it does hurt her, right in that area where the shot was given. She also stated that after she has her second shot on 12Apr2021, she would like to talk to somebody and she would like to be able to have people in her home. She was reporting she had COVID three weeks ago, would she be ok after the 2nd shot to go out? She stated her daughter thinks she needs to wait until the end of April. She verified she did receive the Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine. Swelling: Patient stated her arm is swelling. Also stated she always gets that and today there&#39;s a circle there and it is red and hard. Also stated occurred after the shot. Patient reported that the shot hurt like heck and she couldn&#39;t really tell, she has big arms, she knows it was swollen. Reported she took over the counter medicines, last night she noticed it was a circle and it was hard there. Stated area is not swelling anymore, now just one hard red circle. Red and a hard circle: She also reporting her entire arm ached after the shot, she stated she knows her entire muscle was aching. Stated it was swollen quite a bit but now its just red and a hard circle, and it&#39;s ongoing. Arm swelling outcome: Patient reporting yesterday afternoon, she was feeling better, except that one spot. She stated it does hurt when she bends it because she had that one little area that&#39;s swollen. Also stated the swelling started later that afternoon after the shot. Reported she went for a walk with her daughter and her arm started aching. It felt like she couldn&#39;t go to the bathroom, cramps. It felt like she had a little bit of the flu, and it was from the shot but it only lasted a few days. Stated that part went fast, got a fever, other than that, just the one area on her arm. Stated she doesn&#39;t even feel sick from the shot or anything. Stated she had Diarrhea: Stated she had diarrhea in the beginning after the shot then had trouble going to the bathroom. Stated she thinks its because she has IBS and that&#39;s how her body is. She doesn&#39;t know if that&#39;s from the shot or not because that&#39;s how her body always is. Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 Vaccine: Patient stated she doesn&#39;t want COVID again. She has respiratory problems anyway, she has asthma and a little bit of obesity. She states she was in fear of herself. She doesn&#39;t do well with hospitals and being put under with that medicine. Also stated patient knew COVID causes a lot of people having trouble breathing and she doesn&#39;t want to end up on a breathing tube where its breathing for her and she never sees her family again. Caller states it kind of scared her. Patient stated her niece and nephew, whos got it worse. She stated she went to the hospital and haven&#39;t been back. She stated she was hospitalized about 2 weeks ago, and that&#39;s when she was diagnosed with COVID, before she got the first COVID shot. About the medical history, non-alcoholic liver disease: Stated diagnosed about eight years ago, she would say the same time, about 7 to 8 years ago because she had a virus and when she went in the hospital, the virus had attacked her right kidney and liver. She stated with non-alcoholic liver disease, she is overweight, and that causes her to have issues with her liver. The last few times her liver has been okay. Pre-Diabetic: They have been watching that for a while. Stated she gets edema, swelling in her legs, well, all the time. She has had this the last two years because she is pre-diabetic and a lot of overweight people have that. She also has varicose veins so that doesn&#39;t help. Stated that was given those to help break up, because she had pneumonia when she got the COVID and she had a little bit of pneumonia and had trouble breathing. The patient was recovering from arm was sore and achy/her arm started aching, swelling/her arm is swelling and for other events it was recovering.

                                                I have been hurting constantly since my 1st vaccine on March.23,2021...For a couple of days afterward I had achy flu-like symptoms all over my body which seemed to subside by days 3 &amp; 4, Then I started having shooting pains between my shoulder blades that felt like I was being stabbed. My flu-like aches sky-rocketed until I had to start sitting perfectly still - any movement at ALL caused me wrenching, agonizing pain.  I thought I might be having a heart attack! I went to my Doctor - on Monday.  My BP was really good,  my heartbeat was strong,  my lungs were clear except for a touch of wheezing due to asthma, etc.  Right after this visit I got in my car to drive home, and I could hardly move! Same thing happened last week after a GYN appt... Could hardly drive home! Two weeks ago I came home hurting with acute pains and I was laboring to draw my breath...  Then the pain was so strong that I had to sit it n the same spot for 3 hrs unable to move!

                                                has possible atrial fibrillation; Arm would get hurt; her arm felt like a bruise; irregular heart rates; She&#39;ll have  a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night.; When probing for specific event information she reports it&#39;s kind of like she coughs a little more and she is a little more short of breath and it&#39;s happening more often; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 63 years, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 04:06 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn&#39;t remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn&#39;t take any types of &#34;cillins&#34; medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she&#39;s noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn&#39;t feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it&#39;s going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she&#39;s not even doing anything. She hasn&#39;t even worked out yet. She doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. Medications don&#39;t work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She&#39;s been reporting online. Clarified she&#39;s reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She&#39;s been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband&#39;s cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She&#39;s also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband&#39;s heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn&#39;t messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she&#39;s standing completely still. Then she&#39;ll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she&#39;s been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it&#39;s going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she&#39;s never had her heartrate go down that far, it&#39;s really really weird. She thinks maybe she&#39;ll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s. Now the device says possible atrial fibrillation. It was further reported that she received the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm because she has bursitis in her right. If she hit her arm the second day after the Covid 19 vaccine, her arm would hurt. Her arm felt better the next day. She clarifies, on Sunday, 28Mar2021, she noticed her arm felt like a bruise and that was it. Then the next day on Monday, 29Mar2021, the feeling was gone. She didn&#39;t have any redness. The outcome of the events her arm felt like a bruise and arm would get hurt was recovered on 29Mar2021, irregular heart rates, dyspnea, cough was not recovered and unknown outcome for has possible atrial fibrillation.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included leukaemia, seasonal allergy, anaphylactic reaction, drug hypersensitivity. Concomitant medication(s) included fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for hypersensitivity from an unspecified start date and ongoing; dasatinib monohydrate (SPRYCEL, NDC: 0003-0524-11) taken for chronic myeloid leukaemia from 2013 to an unspecified stop date; spironolactone (SPIRONOLACTONE) taken for fluid retention from 2017 to an unspecified stop date; mirabegron (MYRBETRIQ) taken for hypertonic bladder, start and stop date were not reported and unspecified medications for leukemia. The patient previously received Epipen for anaphylactic allergies to foods, drug, and environmental allergies. Caller was calling about the Pfizer BioNtech COVID vaccine. She has had a plethora side effects since her second dose 24Mar2021. It all started with chest wall erythema then it moved to axillary node lymphadenopathy the she got a high fever of 103 and then there was myalgia all across her torso, abdomen, and and upper back, she clarifies her trapezius area. She confirmed on 24Mar2021 the chest wall erythema began that afternoon, 24Mar2021. Axillary node lymphadenopathy began Thursday, she confirms 25Mar2021 ongoing improved. The fever began Wednesday, she confirms 24Mar2021 and it was still ongoing. Yesterday she woke up and it was 103 today it is a bit better, it is 101.2. She confirms today it seems to be improved a bit but yesterday she was taking hand fulls of Ibuprofen to try to get it down. The myalgia she noticed Thursday 25Mar2021 and it was ongoing, it was some what improved. She has environmental allergies. She had some throat tightness the day of the COVID vaccine that dissipated late that afternoon and that was for both doses. She carries an Epipen because she has food, drug, and environmental allergies. She has had anaphylactic allergies to foods. She clarified she was far from needing to use an Epipen with the her doses of the COVID vaccine, the throat tightness just dissipated. She does not think an Epipen would have helped a fever and body aches anyway. She said she takes Spironolactone for fluid retention from the Sprycel. She tried to look up to see if there was any interaction between the vaccine and Sprycel but she couldn&#39;t find any thing. Her husband was in the pharmaceutical industry as well and they have looked up available information of duration of side effects and they couldn&#39;t fine anything and she was just surprised that after 4 days of it she was still waking up with fever and still having myalgia. She was wondering if the agencies had reported or maybe they have not unmasked any data yet of duration of things reported that are listed. It just seemed extremely unusual. Caller reported fever after her second dose of the Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 vaccine. She said yesterday she was taking hand fulls of Ibuprofen to try to get the fever down. Today the fever was a bit better but it was still ongoing. The outcome of the event fever, myalgia were not recovered, chest wall erythema was recovered on 27Mar2021, throat tightness was recovered on an unspecified date and axillary node lymphadenopathy was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

                                                incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp; her lips had started swelling; her tongue was tingling; she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction; she was just tired; type 1 hypersensitivity; a little soreness; It was like heaviness on her chest; having trouble breathing; allergic contact dermatitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a physician. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn&#39;t have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn&#39;t have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn&#39;t even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can&#39;t really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event &#39;she was just tired&#39; was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                D Dimer was high; Chest tightness; blood clots in the lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 14Apr2021 10:30 (Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing retinal tear from an unknown date (long ago, maybe 2005), Blood pressure, anxiety, reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, eye care. Three years ago, patient had a blood clot on the portal vein. She was treated with Eliquis, referring to Apixaban, for six months. Then they went into the D Dimer and found out she only had one gene for the blood clots, so they discontinued Eliquis, referring to Apixaban. The doctor said the protocol didn&#39;t call for it because she only had one gene. Eliquis, referring to Apixaban, was discontinued a year and half ago. The reporter mentioned the specifically didn&#39;t get the Johnson and Johnson shot due to blood clots. Family History included that her mother and sister had blood clots in the past unrelated to the vaccine, anxiety which her mom has. Concomitant medications included ramipril taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date (for five to ten years) and ongoing; ongoing omeprazole taken for reflux; fluoxetine  taken for anxiety (for what her mom has) taking for three years and ongoing; linaclotide (LINZESS) taken for irritable bowel syndrome taking for 3 year and ongoing; magnesium sulfate taken for eye care taking for 3 year and ongoing; latanoprost taken for retinal tear from 2005 and ongoing.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. The patient previously received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 26MAR2021 at 1000AM in the right upper arm (Lot number for first dose is ER8732; expiration date 31Jul2021). Last Wednesday she started to have tightness in her chest so they called an ambulance. She was admitted to the hospital 28Apr2021 and was discharged Saturday 01May2021. In the hospital they did a CT and it came out that she had bilateral blood clots in the lungs; the doctor said it was a shower of blood clots in the lungs, small enough not to occlude anything. They treated with a 72 hour heparin drip. They didn&#39;t do any more CT but they did put her on Eliquis, referring to Apixaban, for the rest of her life. For the Eliquis he mentioned the generic Apixaban; unknown manufacturer; caller did not see NDC, lot, or expiration date on product dispensed in a pharmacy vial. Last time she was also on the Apixaban, not the brand Eliquis but they have discarded all the old product. The patient also did an X Ray; EKG (Electrocardiogram) was normal sinus; all the blood work including the CBC (Full blood count) was normal on an unknown date; her D Dimer was high on 01May2021. The events required a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome of the event chest pain was recovered with sequelae, of  blood clots in the lungs was not recovered, of other events was unknown.   Batch/Lot number had been obtained. Further information has been requested

She had a history of being very reactive respiratory wise to irritants in the air. 45 minutes after first dose, patient experienced vocal chord swelling, stuffy nose, lost her voice, lungs start feeling gooey and congested on 19Mar2021. And 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine she had airway edema on 19Mar2021, which was not uncommon for her as she had a very reactive airway. The patient usually had airway edema when she was around any sort of latex, perfumes, chemicals, things like that. She took meds (levosalbutamol hydrochloride (XOPENEX), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), 5mg prednisone) immediately, inhalers and everything was fine 45 minutes to hour later. The airway edema subsided in 1.5 hours. She never went into respiratory distress. The patient took daily medications but declined to provide details on them, she did not believe this event was from them as she had been taking these medications for years. Reporter seriousness for airway edema was medically significant. Outcome of airway edema was recovered on 19Mar2021, and outcome of other events was recovered in Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal relationship, A possible causal relationship between events Respiratory tract oedema, Pulmonary congestion, Vocal cord inflammation, Nasal congestion ,Aphonia and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded    &#34;The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Initially presented to emergent care on 4/8/21 for left arm pain, SOB on exertion, and intractable headache. Headache had been ongoing for 12 days. It was throbbing and in the frontal region with nausea. No phonophobia. No weakness. No vision loss. No speech impediment.  She was somewhat less active given her severe headache. She was found to have a DVT in the left arm and bilateral PE with heart strain. Referred to Hospital and admitted. Started on lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hrs and elected to be transition to coumadin since her sister had another blood clot on Eliquis.  Neurology started her on gabapentin. She was discharged and told to follow-up with hematology and warfarin clinic. Presented to the ER on 4/27/21 with SOB at night that had been worsening the past 2 nights. Denied dyspnea or chest pain. Sx were thought to be due to anxiety given her hx of panic attacks. She was discharged home and saw hematology the following day. Hematologist noted that her SOB was gradually improving and her left arm swelling and vascular changes had resolved. Repeat CT showed improvement in clotting burden and stable pulmonary and hepatic nodules.

A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 63-year-old) as 1st DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Patient took vaccine as she wanted to fly on an airplane and not worry as heavily. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, patient had diabetes for at least 5 years, ongoing high blood pressure from an unknown date, reporter think patient high blood pressure was more with her weight because patient was obese. Patient was immunocompromised with her diabetes. Patient had no relevant family medical history. Concomitant medication included ongoing metformin (METFORMIN) taken for diabetes mellitus. Patient has been on it for years. Reporter believed she was on the max dose that she thinks was 2000mg, but could be wrong. Patient was not eating or drinking from 03Apr2021 and did throw up. On 06Apr2021 patient was tested positive for Covid and experienced hypoglycemic shock at 11:00, renal failure and Covid fog. Reportedly, patient also experienced viral pneumonia, mobility issues, gets out of breath easily, weak, her blood sugar was 28, covid fog, couldn&#39;t remember anything which wasn&#39;t normal, wbc was elevated and headache. The patient was hospitalized for hypoglycemic shock and COVID-19 from 06Apr2021 to 17Apr2021 (11 days), then discharged and was told by her HCP to wait 8-12 weeks before getting second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine. Patient scheduled to receive second vaccine dose 15May2021. Reporter was told that it was a max of 42 days that patient can get the second dose of the vaccine, but that has obviously since passed. They want patient to come in and get a second first shot. When patient was admitted, the doctor thought patient had viral pneumonia already for at least a week, so it would have started about when she got the shot. Patient was better, she was not on oxygen anymore, but she still gets out of breath easily. Patients mobility issues started when she came down with symptoms. Patient had renal failure and was weak. Patient was not eating or drinking. Patient was diabetic and she had hypoglycemic shock which was what put her in the hospital. Reporter thought it was probably a cold or flu or something and Easter happened where she was not hungry and did throw up. Reporter thought it was something she ate that was bad. When she had the hypoglycemic shock reporter could not wake her and patient was in some kind of unresponsive state from 11:00 to about 15:45. Patient blood sugar was 28 when the paramedics arrived. They were able to get her responsive and transferred her to the hospital. They ended up putting her on a dextrose drip because they could not keep her blood sugar up. They put her on steroids and the number went sky high into the 500s and they could not control it in the hospital. There was a lot of stuff that happened. Reporter did not believe that patient has any lasting effects from the hypoglycemic shock. Patient sugar was back to normal and she was on her normal medications. Patient was off insulin which they gave her in the hospital, so that part was okay. Patient was dealing with Covid fog also. Reporter does not know if it has to do with blood sugar or how the virus attacks the body. Patient had multiple MRIs because they were worried, she had a stroke, and she said she could not remember anything which was not normal. Patient not eating and drinking started right before Easter and was much better. Reporter believed that at about 14Apr2021 or so patient started to eat better and have more of an appetite for food. Patient has recovered completely. The reporter did not notice the Covid fog until her mother was in the hospital on 06Apr2021. She does not remember her first week in the hospital, and then even when she was discharged on 17Apr2021 that whole next week she was still very foggy. The reporter would say she was better now. patient talks normally and was back to swearing which is perfectly her. Patient has recovered completely at this point. Patient mobility was better. Patient was not using the walker in the house today, and her balance was better. It was probably due to some of the side effects of the medicines they added like a beta blocker and other things to make sure she was okay. Regarding kidney failure started, reporter stated on 06Apr2021 patient creatinine was 3.99. Patient also had a high D dimer and were worried about her clotting and throwing a PE or something. That was mostly in the first few days around the 6Apr2021, 7Apr2021, 8Apr2021, 9 Apr2021, 10Apr2021 when they were not sure what was going to happen. The following week patient was still at 5 to 6 liters of oxygen, but by Friday night 16Apr2021 she was down to 1 liter of oxygen. Patient did not come home on oxygen. Reporter believed patient kidneys have recovered, but she did not know. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.47 on an unknown date, 0.97 on Sep2020, reporter does not know if it returned to 0.97, but the last number she knows of was 1.47, 3.99 on 06Apr2021, blood creatinine: 1.47 on 17Apr2021. Patient had normal bloodwork in Sep2020 and her creatinine was 0.97. Reporter did not know if it returned to 0.97, but the last number she knows of was 1.47. That would have been when patient was discharged from the hospital. Blood glucose: 500s on an unknown date in Apr2021, blood glucose: 28 on 06Apr2021. On 06Apr2021 patient was tested positive for Covid. On an unknown date patient got CT, high d dimer, CBC, MRI, metabolic function test, white blood cell count, X-ray and Chem 28. Reportedly, bloodwork were done daily in the hospital, and patient has had bloodwork once since she was discharged. WBC was elevated so they did a blood culture to make sure patient did not have an infection. The culture was negative. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There was no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. There were predisposing factors diabetes and immunosuppression. Patient started Tylenol pill on 06Apr2021 after vaccination at an unknown dose. They gave it to her continuously because she had bad headaches. They started her on antivirals and took her off of Remdesivir because of her kidneys. They put her on a different antiviral that the reporter did not remember the name of and a biologic. Home health just discharged patient, and she was still dealing with viral pneumonia and mobility issues. Patient was still on different medicines and she normally was not. The report is related to study or programme. The outcome of the event hypoglycemic shock was recovered on 06Apr2021 and was not eating or drinking was recovered on 14Apr2021, viral pneumonia, mobility issues, was recovering, renal failure, positive for covid 19, gets out of breath easily, weak, her blood sugar was 28, went sky high into the 500s and they couldn&#39;t control it in the hospital, covid fog, couldn&#39;t remember anything which wasn&#39;t normal, wbc was elevated, throw up and headaches was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734; NDC &amp; Expiry date: unknown) (at the age of 63 years old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Patient took Pfizer COVID vaccine because of her job. She works with the public at a public library. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine and additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect were reported as none. Medical history included acid reflux for years, colitis, bad sinus issues for several years and COVID-19 diagnosed on 04Jan2021. Part of her sinus issues, is that her sinuses block up and stuff drips down the back of her throat. Whenever she had COVID in Jan2021, the main thing that bothered her was a terrible sore throat. Whenever she had COVID, she went to an urgent care and the doctor told her that her throat was swollen bad. She kept spitting phlegm out in the toilet, and the doctor told her if it got any worse, she may need to go to the hospital, if her throat is starting to swell closed. The urgent care doctor prescribed her a steroid, and she took that for a week. She has a bad right shoulder; it aches all of the time. She does not like going to the doctor, so she has not had it checked out. She has frozen shoulder in both of her shoulders. She clarified that she had shoulder issues before receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine. She constantly has neck pain. It is normal for her to have aches in the back of her neck. The pain from her shoulders goes into her neck. Patient reported that there was this thing that runs in her family. She has never been tested for it. It is a disease. Her mom and dad do not think that she has it. She thinks that is called Marie Toothe disease. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate (FLONASE) for bad sinus issues, famotidine for 2 years for acid reflux, and has been taking mesalazine (LIALDA) for years for colitis. She takes Flonase pretty much daily in the summer. She stopped taking during the winter. She started taking it again a couple of months ago. She started back taking it whenever things started blooming. Patient reported that she got hives from a flu shot. Flu shot name, NDC, lot number and expiration date were unknown. Hives after a flu shot happened five years ago, she has not gotten a flu shot since. On an unspecified date, the patient called to report reactions. She was concerned about getting her second dose of the COVID vaccine. Patient&#39;s weight was between 110 and 120 pounds. She was diagnosed with COVID on 04Jan2021. Because of COVID, she lost weight, she got down to 110 pounds. Now she is putting weight back on and getting back to her regular size of 120 pounds. She lost a bunch of weight whenever she was sick with COVID. She has been trying to call the CDC but has not been able to get through to speak to anyone. She received the first dose of the COVID vaccine in her left arm, because her left arm is normally better. She received the first dose of the COVID vaccine at 1:00PM. They made her sit around and wait for 30 minutes because she has had flu shot reactions before. She waited the 30 minutes and felt okay. Then she noticed at dinner time, about four or five hours after the first dose of the COVID vaccine that she was feeling muscle pain all over, her muscles felt achy. After she got the first dose of the COVID vaccine, she felt like COVID was coming back into throat. At supper time, she could not eat because of throat tightness. She had to eat soup and could not take one of her big pills: Began probably about four to five hours after receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine. Her throat has been doing this weird thing where it feels better, and then feels tight again. It is back and forth. Right now, it is better. This Saturday, she was supposed to get her second dose of the COVID vaccine. She is worried that her throat will swell up worse. She is asking if she should get the second dose of the COVID vaccine. About one week before receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine, her throat was sore and bothering her. She went to urgent care on 22Mar2021. She had COVID in Jan2021, her throat has gone back and forth like this. At urgent care, they did a COVID test on her and it was negative. They also did strep test on her and it was negative. The doctor looked at her throat and said he did not see anything. The doctor did not really want to look in her throat. The doctor was worried she may have COVID, so he only took a quick look. She felt like muscle tightness started in the shoulder when she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine. Her shoulder muscle got tight, then the tightness went to the back of her neck, then to the front of her neck. She also had pressure in her ear on that same side; she clarified that pressure was behind her ear. She thinks the pressure in her ear was from swelling. Shoulder tightness, back of neck tightness, front of neck tightness, and pressure behind her ear all happened at the same time. She was hurting so bad. The tightness and pressure come and goes. She is starting to wonder if wearing a mask is causing this. She wears two cloth masks at work. She does not like wearing medical grade face masks because she feels like she cannot breathe. After work, she will come home, and her throat will be a little sore. She was asking if there are lymph nodes in her throat. Under her chin, on both sides, there are swollen lumps. The left side was worse. She put ice on it, and it felt better. Began on 27Mar2021, she could not sleep that night which was weird because it comes and goes. Whenever it comes and goes, it was probably not as bad as the day that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine. It still hurts. She was asking if this is an immune inflammatory response. She was supposed to get her second dose of the COVID vaccine this Saturday. She is freaking out about it. Everyone has told her that the second dose of the COVID vaccine is worse than the first dose. She was asking if they can give her the second dose of the COVID vaccine in her thigh instead. She is worried that if she gets the second dose of the COVID vaccine in her thigh, that she will not be able to walk after. The adverse events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room/Physician Office. She is thinking about going to see a doctor. The night that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, she thought to herself that if she got any worse, she would go to the emergency room. She was close to going to the emergency room. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event burning sensation was recovered, muscle pain was recovering, tiredness was not recovered, while for the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                A series of inflammatory events occurred which began with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I initially developed a rash at the injection site of the first dose within hours of the injection. That was my only symptom after the first dose. The nurse at the vaccination site suggested that the second dose be administered in the other arm due to the rash which was still vivid. Within hours I also had a rash on the second arm as well. Over the next few days rashes appeared in the crook of my elbows and at my waistline. Shortly thereafter I developed &#34;dry eye&#34;. My eyes were dry and sensitive to bright light. Then I started to have discomfort when I took a deep breath. On April 29, 2021 I had severe discomfort when breathing and was diagnosed by my doctor with pleurisy and possible pericarditis. I could not lie down for ten days and had to rest sitting up. Over time, and with the help of a great deal of ibuprofen I have improved. I no longer have discomfort when breathing and the rashes are 99% gone. The &#34;dry eye&#34; is slowly improving.

A 63-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. One month after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, on an unspecified date, the patient experienced shortness of breath, increased heart rate up to 130 bpm, lightheadedness, fatigue. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: 130 bpm. She wants to know if there any been any other reports of any cardiac issues one month after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown. Response: Reviewed attached FACT SHEET FOR HCPs ADMINISTERING VACCINE and no information found regarding cardiac related events post vaccination. Spoke from attached FAQ-COVID-19 Vaccine-Pfizer Response to Reported Cases of Myocarditis in Recipients of COVID-19 Vaccine and Serious and Severe Adverse Events. Offered to send pdf document via email, caller declined. Referred to HCP Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events, increased heart rate, Dizziness, Dyspnea, Fatigue cannot be completely ruled out. The impact of this report on benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethic committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                A couple of hours or so after the  second vaccine my body felt achy and feverish.  Also started to get the chills and then a headache.  The symptoms gradually got worse over the course of time,  took a couple of Advil and went to bed.   It was difficult to sleep as my legs ached so badly I could not get into a comfortable position.  As the night progressed and and fell in and out of sleep, the pain and especially the chills and headache were unbearable.  I woke up around 10-11 pm with my throat numb, feeling tight, my tongue was numb at the back and the front area of my tongue was numb and tingling.  I was nervous and scared to go back to sleep.  My family all asleep and did not want to unnecessarily awaken them. I put myself into an upright position for fear of anaphylaxis.  Considered calling 911= but we live in a quiet community and waited to see if it got worse.  I did not sleep all night, finally got some rest while sitting upright.  The following day all the symptoms were there and fever, chills and body aches worsened.  My temp was around 101.  Drank a lot of water.  Today, my throat does not feel the same.   Feels like something is there but cannot describe the feeling.  Have been tired these past couple of days.  Not usual for me but cannot say it is due to the vaccine.  I will comment in that I never had the chills so bad as I had experience with actually being sick.  Was horrible.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

                                                Normal sinus rhythm but throwing PVCs; Elevated pulse with chest tightness; Elevated pulse with chest tightness; A little atelectasis in lower left lung; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 14Jan2021 09:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing does not have a thyroid; allergies/intolerance to gluten and dairy, allergies to molds, dust and some seasonal allergies; all ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from Feb2013 to unspecified date, from unspecified date and ongoing for &#34;does not have a thyroid&#34;. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergic reaction occurred at 13 years of age with unknown cough syrup with codeine, levaquin and experienced allergic reaction occurred probably while she was in her 20s (age in years). She had fallen asleep on the couch about 9:00 pm on 14Jan2021. She woke up about 9:30 pm on 14Jan2021 and had an elevated pulse with chest tightness. She had to go to the emergency room in response to elevated pulse with chest tightness. In the emergency room they were not able to do anything other than hydrate her and all of that but it took about 12-13 more hours for her elevated pulse to come down (15Jan2021). Her biggest question was that she saw where some reactions are fast heart beat but she was kind of surprised at how long after the dose was administered that she had onset of the elevated pulse. She saw Cardiologist 18Jan2021 related to this event and the Cardiologist was a little baffled by the event. She reported event as improved, although she still has a little bit of tightness in her chest which goes in a little bit of phases. The Cardiologist told her to still take the second dose as scheduled of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She did not see her family doctor, she saw the Cardiologist only as referred after emergency room visit. She was not admitted to the hospital; she was treated and kept under observation in the emergency room for about 5.5 hours. She has a stress test scheduled for next week. She is planning to still get the second dose as scheduled of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine but she is a little scared to get it due to this adverse event. She thought the events were related with the vaccine, she had no problem prior to getting the vaccine. On 14Jan2021, pulse was 146 beats per minute which she checked with a pulse oximeter machine she has at home so she knows it is accurate; Chest x-ray: She reported that result of a little atelectasis in lower left lung was a little weird. On 18Jan2021, the EKG result was Normal sinus rhythm but throwing PVCs. She reported she knows her thyroid lab is normal because it was checked in the emergency room during visit starting 14Jan2021. The outcome of the events elevated pulse with chest tightness was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                37 hours after Pfizer injection,  experienced severe abdominal pain that caused me to have vasovagal syncope.  Started sweating, and I lost my vision, then must have fallen on the floor.   When I came to, felt very headachy and nauseous.   went to urgent care - they ordered an abdominal scan for 2/8/21 but scan did not reveal the cause of the pain.  8 hours later on 2/5/21, started feeling asthma like symptoms.  Throat felt tight, voice became hoarse, kept having to cough because airway was starting to feel thickened.   went to ER, they took vitals and told me that i wasn&#39;t having  an allergic reaction because my symptoms were outside the time frame for an allergic reaction.  After 3 hours there, they sent me home.  Next morning felt like I was having heart palpitations. that feeling eventually went away if I walked around.  But the following two mornings, I had the same feeling.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Severe difficulty breathing; difficulty breathing frightened her; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 64 -year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), intramuscular (on the upper left shoulder) on 27Jan2021 09:20 (at the age of 64-year-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed about 14 years ago, breast cancer from Dec2017 and ongoing diagnosed in Dec2017, ongoing asthma she was diagnosed with asthma when she was 39 years old, surgery from an unknown date, she had surgery to correct a deviated septum and her asthma got better, she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). On 27Jan2021 she had the first injection. It was about 14 to 16 hours after the injection that she had severe difficulty breathing. Reported she has asthma. She was a cancer survivor, and she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. The difficulty breathing woke her out of her sleep. She had to call the doctor since she is concerned about her second dose which is scheduled for 17Feb2021. The difficulty breathing frightened her, and it was not an immediate reaction, she had the shot at 9:30 am (clarifies she received the injection at 09:20 am) and between 1 to 2 am in the night, she woke up not able to breathe. She could not use her inhaler since she could not really breathe in. She was obviously able to get some air in since she did not pass out. She contacted her doctor and he will send her a prescription to get an Epipen, so she has it on hand when she gets her second dose. Her doctor does not want her to not get the second dose. States she is concerned about other asthmatics receiving the vaccine and wanted to call and report this. She expected it to happen onsite where she received the injection but it did not. Her doctor asked her if she thought it was an asthma attack and she told her doctor that she has not felt like this in 24 years. Treatment/Outcome: She stepped out into the cold to shrink her airways and then was able to use her inhaler. Reports it was not a 2 hour episode thank god, and within 15 minutes she was able to force an inhaler dose in. Everything is fine. She is a breast cancer survivor and cannot use her right side so she had the injection on her left side in her upper shoulder, she has to wait 5 years to be considered cancer free. Her doctor suggested to use her albuterol inhaler for 4 days in advance of getting the second dose of the vaccine. She would think that would be abusing her albuterol but she will do that since she was instructed to do so by her doctor. She was terrified. She will have an Epipen on hand when she goes to get her second dose.  She understands the symptoms can be worse with the second dose, she is anticipating everything should be fine. The outcome of the event difficulty of breathing was recovered on Jan2021, for the other event was unknown. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations, states she has had everything. No Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks.

                                                I had severe COVID and was hospitalized on Dec 7,  I was in hospital (non ICU setting) for 5 days and had O2, remdisiver and dethemethzone IV.  I recovered fully, and have felt very good since mid January.  My reaction after my 1st dose of vaccine on Feb 25  started 20 hours after shot.  Worsened through the day and I got sicker at 24-36 hours, and then stayed in bed another day.  Symptoms were identical to my bout with COVID:  chills (no fever),  nausea, aches in joints and muscles, fatigue.  They were quite significant==I could not be out of bed.  As it went along I also developed the feeling in my chest like COVID--tough to take deep breath, chest hurt---but my O2 readings were fine.   Recovered after 48 hours, People who have had COVID should be aware that they will have a significant response to the vaccine on the 1st does.  I am questioning having a second dose I have not reported this to my doctor

                                                I was okay until after arriving home at which time I developed and headache and exhaustion. I went straight to bed for 2 days with headache, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t eat or drink. I started to feel a little better but still was unable to eat and was fatigued. When I did try to eat I got terrible diarrhea almost immediately. Over the next few days, realizing this was probably not normal, I contacted the advice nurse at my provider and eventually talk to a doctor on Friday (March 5). That doctor thought it sounded like I contracted COVID. I had a test that day that came back the next day negative. I have an appointment to talk to my regular doctor on Wednesday (March 10), particularly to get advise about whether to get the 2nd dose on March 20. My blood pressure has been unusually low (as low as 85/58) but is now about 120/60. I did not have a fever. My breathing has been more labored than usual, but my oxygen level is at 97% and my pulse is around 65.

                                                When driving home following 15 minute wait period I felt my throat tighten, ears flush and heart rate increasing.  I immediately began to monitor my heart rate with my Watch.  My resting heart rate is in the 60?s.  At the time I looked at the watch my heart rate was already in the low 100?s but was rapidly escalating until in a matter of a few minutes had reached 140 bpm and my head began to have a full sensation and I was  becoming very shaky.  I pulled over into the parking lot of a restaurant and asked them to call 911.  As they were talking with the dispatch my pulse started to decline so I cancelled the request.  I stayed at the restaurant until friends to could come pick me up.  By the time they arrived my pulse was in the low 100?s.  I took 2 Benadryl.  I monitored my BP through the night and it did not return to the 60?s until 1:00 am.   I took (2) 25 mg Benadryl at approximately 4:00 pm,  took another 2 at around 9:00 pm when my heart rate started to escalate and then a final 2 before going to bed at 1:00 am.  My pulse dropped back into the 60?s while I was sleeping and stayed that way through the night.  I woke up with no further symptoms nor side effects from the shot.  The throat tightness and flushing of the ears resolved after the first dose of Benadryl.  I had no adverse reactions or significant side effects from he first dose of Pfizer.

                                                My mother became short of breath over the course of the week after her second dose of the the Pfizer Covid19 vaccine.  She was taken to the emergency room and was diagnosed with pericardial effusion and admitted for treatment that included draining fluid from the sac around her heart.  She was released and then developed the same symptoms again within a week.  She again had pericardial effusion, and was told she had severe emphysema with no prior diagnosis.  She is still hospitalized and is now suffering heart failure with no clear diagnosis as to why, no acceptable plan of treatment, and a prognosis of wait and see.  She has consistently tested negative for Covid19.

Horrible shortness of breath began on the third day, March 8, and continued to worsen. For the next week my breathing became more and more labored with difficulty in functioning and needing to be in a reclining position in order to breathe. By the 10th day, o n March 15th I was hospitalized and subsequently had tests run on heart and lungs. My blood oxygen would drop to the low 80&#39;s if I took just a few steps. Today, on March 19th I am home and slowly improving but still needing to be mostly resting.

                                                I have tinnitus...so loud I can not get away from it. I noticed it when I went to sleep last night. I had the shot at 3Pm Saturday. I woke up at 3:47 and started to feel terrible. Chills, severe congestion, head hurt so bad, nauseous, ached all over. I have never felt so badly EVER. at 3pm Sunday I took two tylenol and everything got better. I was fatigued but functioning. I still had a slight headache but was able to eat a light dinner. Monday I was so fatigued I could not drive or go to work. I had severe brain fog.  Monday night I noticed how loud my ears were when I went to bed. I could not get away from the noise. today the brain fog seems to be lifting but I am still drained and not feeling great. no energy. I have heart palpitations and shortness of breath. At one point I had a pain in my chest and was concerned about a blood clot. That seems to have passed the palpiations remain.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6198; expiration date: unknown), at vaccination age 64-year-old via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Mar2021 09:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she had side effects after getting her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine Saturday morning (13Mar2021) at 09:30am. She mentioned that she developed side effects Monday (15Mar2021) night that she also had all day Tuesday (16Mar2021), it was pretty significant. She mentioned that she is concerned about getting the second dose, and she is thinking that she is not going to get that after having her first dose. She stated that her side effects lasted all night Monday night, she had shortness of breath and coughing. She added that on Tuesday morning she started having chills, shakes, throwing up or vomiting, and having massive diarrhea all day long. She also mentioned that she thought it was serious, and she was going to have to go to the hospital soon. She wasn&#39;t going to have a choice if it hadn&#39;t gotten better. She reported that all her side effects are better, and that for treatment, she took some Delsym cough medicine and diarrhea medicine, Imodium, she thinks it was called. She says she took one dose of the cough medicine yesterday morning, and she has taken 3 doses of Imodium today. She wondered if she should take the second shot or if she would get the same symptoms again. She says she is hesitant to take second one because she doesn&#39;t want respiratory distress again (Mar2021), it was horrible, and she has never had massive diarrhea before to where she couldn&#39;t get to the bathroom, it was the worst thing she has went through. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The contributory role of the suspect productbnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6198; expiration date: unknown), to reported events is possible.

I am sure later I had a TIA. Was unable to communicate. I knew what I wanted to say but I could not get the words out. March 1/2021   I went on FLMA. It never dawned on me the vaccine could have affected my already stressed heart. I am still experiencing these symptoms. I just thought of this this week. I still have extreme fatigue, increased palpitations,  and increased SOB. I do not feel able to work right now.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021. States she had real bad pressure in her head and high blood pressure and felt like her heart was skipping beats on unspecified date. States her blood pressure was around 152/100 on 09Mar2021. One-day blood pressure was real low, 88 over something but that kind of went away. States all that information was already reported. The next week, she thought she was feeling better and that Monday and Tuesday felt back to normal. Stated that on Thursday night (Mar2021), she was just sitting and around 8 o&#39;clock her blood pressure spiked within a few minutes to around 184/105 and she wasn&#39;t doing anything; she couldn&#39;t get it to go down. States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor. Stated she was on a really low dose of blood pressure medication, stating that she had occasional problems with her blood pressure in the past but it never went that high. Her blood pressure was usually in the 140&#39;s or 150&#39;s over 90 something. States that now it is much higher and happening every night. Caller stated that Wednesday night (24Mar2021) her blood pressure started to spike every 5 to 6 hours, stating it first started at 830 at night and again at 230 in the morning. She has been feeling unwell since that shot. Her doctor thinks it may be causing inflammation. States that they doubled her medication last night and her blood pressure is still going up and up, but usually goes down after a couple of hours. It is totally uncontrolled and her doctors are trying to figure it out. States that meds have been added, including Xanax and will be going to see a heart doctor. States that this has all been since the vaccine. Caller would like to know if people are reporting these symptoms. States that it is pretty terrible, and that she feels normal and then it rushes over her. States that it is exhausting and that she almost went to the ER last night. States that she does not want to go back if she does not have to. When she filed the first report she did not have issues with blood pressure yet. Again, she had the vaccine on Monday 08Mar2021 and that the next Thursday she felt like her heart rate was really high. During that first week, she felt out of rhythm, like missing beats. Her blood pressure dropped low the first week and that just one time was around 152/100 but it didn&#39;t sustain. It then dropped pretty low one day. The next Thursday, it was uncontrollable. It was around 180 over 104 or 105 and that it kept going up, but then back down to 160/90 something. Took Xanax and went to bed, when she woke up this morning it was low, but went right back up within 5 minutes. In the first couple of days, they increased her blood pressure medicine and it seemed to be bringing her blood pressure down and she was able to go to bed. The caller stated that Monday, it will be three weeks. States that a day and a half after the vaccine, her arm was not hurting but was still puffy, but not bad. States that when she runs her hands over it, it is still sore to the touch and a little swollen but nothing extreme. She was concerned that her blood pressure keeps going up and then down. States that the blood pressure started spiking on the 18Mar2021, in the evening very quickly and was very high. Stated that this was happening every night since then until the 24th, when it started spiking every 5-6 hours; and her blood pressure medicine wasn&#39;t controlling it like it was earlier in the week, even though the dose was doubled. For one day it worked good and brought it down low but then, it wasn&#39;t controlling it anymore. She stated no relevant tests, related to this event but states that in her last 2 labs her cholesterol was high. States that it was over 300 and her bad cholesterol double or more triple. States this has been going on for many years. States that she changed her calcium to calcium with vitamin D and her vitamin has come back up. When she was in the ER they did a Metabolic panel and everything looked okay. The adverse events require and emergency room visit. The patient recovered from the event lump in throat on 10Mar2021; the events arm swelled up and was sore recovered in Mar2021; the events erratic heart rate, chest was tight, was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days, wheezing resolved on unspecified date.

Symptoms continued.  Went to primary care doctor on 4/7/21 who pricribed a stronger antihistimine, hydroxyzine.  Symptoms are still continuing. This was my second shot.  No reaction on 1st shot.

If you do have a history of anaphylaxis it is contraindicated for you to recieve the vaccine. If you would like to get your second dose please make sure to stay at site and have them monitor your symptoms due to the fact you stated you had difficulty breathing that way they could take the necessary medical treatment. Otherwise please get the vaccine in the Left arm the second time around and you could take benadryl if you experience any rash or itchiness just make sure you are home because it will make you sleepy.

                                                On 4/6/2021 I went to receive my second COVID-19 (Pfizer) vaccine in the series. I was given 2 vaccines on that date, one right after the other. At about 6 pm on the evening of 4/8/2021, I began to have difficulty swallowing, eventually unable to swallow saliva by around 6:45pm. I was able to force liquid down. My throat remained tight/swollen? so I took 1/2 of a Benadryl at about 8:45. Improvement noted by 9:30 pm. I looked up this symptom and it was noted to be &#34;throat closure sensation&#34;.

This 64-year-old female patient reported for herself that she received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8731) via an unspecified route in the left arm on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 (at the age of 64-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tick bite, blood pressure, nerve pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sciatica. The patient had no family history. The patient had no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) of the COVID vaccine. Ongoing concomitant medications included olmesartan for blood pressure, duloxetine for nerve pain, omeprazole for GERD, famotidine for GERD; all taken for years, meloxicam for sciatica taken for 2 months and ongoing and doxycycline from 16Apr2021 and ongoing for tick bite (reported that she kept forgetting to take it). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8727) on 28Mar2021 at 12:00 in the left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. That dose went in the deltoid and she had no issues. Then she received the second dose on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 in the left arm. She believes it was administered in the soft tissue behind the deltoid. She noticed the person who gave the injection went behind the muscle toward the back of the arm. The next day after the second dose, she felt fine. Then the second morning it felt as if her shoulder was dislocated; and her breast is hard and painful; and she can&#39;t breath. She called her doctor who said that was not a common side effect but she stated she knows it is a side effect. The doctor recommended she go to the ER but patient didn&#39;t want to go. She stated that she doesn&#39;t know if missing the muscle is going to let the medication absorb or if it has penetrated the soft tissue. The clinical course of events was further described as follows: On 20Apr2021 at 08:00, the second morning, she woke up and felt severe pain in her right breast and shoulder all the way to back; adds she can&#39;t move her arm and her breast is so painful she can&#39;t touch it and her shoulder is immobile. She is also having very bad shortness of breath, adds she thought that may be from anxiety; so later in the day she took a alprazolam (XANAX). She added that she put up with the pain all morning and thought maybe she was working herself up so she took one half of a Xanax to calm down, to see if it was just anxiety but the shortness of breath and pain were still there. She reported she was continuing to feel all of these effects at the same level. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the ER because of the expense. The shoulder pain was going down her back to the trapezius. She clarified that she can move her shoulder and her arm, but the pain was so breathtaking that she doesn&#39;t move it and she has her arm in a sling. There were no relevant tests performed. The clinical outcome of the events right breast pain, breast is hard, shoulder pain, shoulder pain going down her back, shortness of breath, can&#39;t move shoulder/arm/ shoulder is immobile, and anxiety was not recovered. The patient mentioned that she doesn&#39;t know if not getting the shot in the deltoid caused her symptoms or not.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6207, at age of 64-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer, autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and Bechet&#39;s. Concomitant medication was not reported. She felt she had an allergic reaction after the first dose on 19Mar2021.  She clarified that her throat felt really itchy, and her lungs started feeling itchy and inflamed, she started coughing and getting asthma. Throat itchy was started 19Mar2021. They made her stay for 15 minutes after. She was sitting there and felt it coming on and took 2 Benadryl, coffee and inhaler. But she told the people there she had to get her inhaler from her car. They helped to walk her out to get it, but it was empty too. It felt like fiberglass in her throat. It lasted 3 weeks and then it returned after the second dose and got worse because of the second vaccine. She always had a tiny itch in her throat because of her allergies and it was there all the time.  She had been on Gerson Therapy for 2 weeks, and it cured her cancer when she was on it. Lungs itchy and inflamed was started on 19Mar2021. She didn&#39;t have her inhaler in the car and when she arrived home she got the one by her bed and it was empty.  She had to go to work and she drank 2 more cups of coffee and went to work.  She started feeling worse.  Her breathing was no better, she had more coughing and was numb all over. She called her Daughter to go to the Emergency Room, but she went to the Urgent Care. She knows it was not the same, but it was closest.  It was a Friday and there was no doctor there. This lasted until she received her new inhaler prescription.  It took 4 days for her to feel better when she was like this. This episode took a week for her to feel better. She didn&#39;t feel good for 3 weeks.  She didn&#39;t go to the Emergency Room.  She was getting back to normal with this by the time she got her 2nd shot. Her friend let her borrow an inhaler at work. The Doctor told her that she took too much Benadryl, but she took 3 in 8 hours, but the doctor said it was too much. Coughing, barking asthma cough: started 19Mar2021 and lasted until she got the inhaler.  It helped, but it took a couple days to get back to normal. By the time she arrived at Urgent Care she was walking crooked, couldn&#39;t talk right, her speech was slurred. Her oxygen levels had dropped at work. It started on 19Mar2021.  She took 2 puffs of her friends inhaler, and her Oxygen level went up on the way to Urgent Care. By the time she got to urgent care her oxygen levels were in the low 90&#39;s instead of in the 80&#39;s. Caller said that her oxygen levels were like 94, but her muscles were still not responding very good. When it was below 85, her left side goes numb and she couldn&#39;t use her left arm and her legs get like spaghetti and she felt like the scarecrow in Wizard of Oz. Her Oxygen was 94 and was much better.  Her muscles were not responding at the time and the Doctor didn&#39;t allow her to drive herself to Walmart to get her prescription. Crooked walk was from 19Mar2021. It got better after she got her prescription and used the inhaler. Usually taking 1 Benadryl and using the inhaler every 4 hours for a few days she gets better. She uses it once and it only takes 20 -30 minutes to feel better again. Legs like spaghetti was started on 19Mar2021.  She still had an itchy throat and light cough in her lungs for quite a while, but it was not life threatening. The numbness on her left side, that occurred 1st, and her right arm only functions. She can use her phone. Caller asking why it goes wacko? It ended on 19Mar2021 and she recovered completely. Her arm was so sore the first time.  It was difficult to get in and out of car for 3 weeks, but she recovered completely. She helps the handicap people, so she had it put in her left hip.  It was sore for about 2 weeks, but she recovered completely. The outcome of the events &#34;Legs like spaghetti&#34; and &#34;Her arm was so sore the first time&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date on 2021, for other events was unknown.

She had allergies and autoimmune disorder. Her arm was so sore/ sore left arm the first time. It was difficult to get in and out of car for 3 weeks, but she recovered completely. She helps the handicap people, so she had it put in her left hip/ sore left hip. It was sore for about 2 weeks, but she recovered completely. Caller added she needed to decipher what was written on the vaccination card.  She wished they would write better. She used her glasses. Caller took no pharmaceuticals, just Benadryl for allergies when need. The Hospital where she received her vaccine was used and created by another facility, but not a an offsite facility. But for them to use also. Caller added she was cured of everything she had from the Therapy. After the second dose: She started same day as vaccine on 08Apr2021. She did her protocol that time, and as far as breathing and that, it was not like the first dose, but towards the evening she had an auto immune response that lasted for 3 weeks.

She was allergic to Tylenol and Aspirin, basically any pain killer, Percocet and Darvocet, Everything except Ibuprofen. Caller did not have the bottle to provide details. She usually put Ibuprofen in her Benadryl bottle for her inflammation. That was the only thing that she took. She took Turmeric and fish oil and several other supplements. Her headache peaked on the 4th day, and she took the Ibuprofen and was better the next day. Throat swelling started on the 5th day and lasted and was still causing her difficulty pronouncing words. Her tongue felt swollen. Her cognitive issues started the 4th day of her headache and was intense. It continued, but was much, much better. She did her normal protocol, and had gotten by, but it was not normal. Her organs felt swollen and the doctor did a test. It was normal, except her bladder, because it was so swollen she felt like she couldn&#39;t empty it completely. The muscles did not work right and she got an bladder infection and received antibiotics, about 2 weeks after the injection, because her bladder wasn&#39;t working right. Urine test: infection.

But with this experience she literally wanted to hurt someone or kill herself, and no it was not normal. She was so cranky. She was sure it was the swelling in her brain. With her food allergies she got swelling, intense depression, suicidal tendencies, and a fight or flight response.  She wanted to leave her life, it was scary. Caller added she did not feel like this now. For the Vaccine Indication: Caller added that people that need it most, didn&#39;t want it.  Because of her autoimmune disorder, she was a long huller and she had died 6 times, so she was willing to try it and take it and deal with the side effects. She was hoping it would not cause any. Her boyfriend died at Christmas. After 24 hours he was dead. He had a mild sepsis from a virus. He has Autoimmune disease. If she got Covid, she didn&#39;t want to end up like him and see her arms and legs amputated. Caller asked if anyone else had reported symptoms she had experienced.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included echocardiogram normal: normal  on unknown date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bronchitis , heart rate high.  The clinical course was reported as follows: Caller received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 09 MAR 2021. Caller states the past couple of months she has experienced a lot of adverse events. Caller states she has had issues with bronchitis and went to a pulmonologists and cardiologists and she has been put on 27 different medications. Caller states after all of these things going on she is not sure if she should receive the second dose. Caller states one doctor told her she should not receive the second dose and one doctor told her she should. Caller would like to know if she should receive the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Caller states her doctor doesn&#39;t want to tell her what to do because she thinks he is afraid that she might sue him. Caller thought that by calling Pfizer she would get some advice but she is getting nowhere. Caller would like to know if she can receive the Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine as her second dose instead of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine? Had the vaccine 9Mar2021 and is just recovering now. Last week, she was finally feeling like herself. She had some medical conditions that put her at risk. She is 65 and is afraid to get the second shot but is also afraid to not get the second shot. Her doctor thinks it is too coincidental that this happened right after the vaccine. Has been talking to a lot of doctors. Is afraid to get the second vaccination. So now, she is just trying to figure it out. It really knocked her out, she has had 27 medications, she&#39;s been to the ER 3 times, been to the doctor 7 times, it just really knocked her out, they first thought it was a heart condition, then a lung condition. Has been having rashes and all kinds of stuff. Is afraid to not get the second dose. One of her doctors recommended the Johnson &amp; Johnson, but is that safe, no. Weight was about 200 pounds. Started 5 days after the vaccine. Fever: On Sunday, started to get a fever. It was on and off all day. She thought it was a normal reaction and didn&#39;t think much of it. It was weird. It would be like 20 minutes and then fine, and would be off an on all day. It was a low grade fever, never more than 100. she felt hot and cold all day. It was most of Sunday and stopped in the evening. Treatment: none. Swelling and pain under breasts, under armpits and in lymph nodes: Started Monday. Breasts were tender as well as if like she was having a period. There was pain underneath her arm and in the lymph nodes. Lasted for 2 days. Treatment was none. Felt like bronchitis: On Tuesday, it started to get what she thought was bronchitis. She has a propensity to get bronchitis. She hasn&#39;t gotten sick  in 2 years. She immediately went to the doctor. This went on for 2 months. Treatment: They prescribed Prednisone, nebulizers and antibiotics which she finished everything 3 weeks ago. She couldn&#39;t sleep and had to sleep sitting up, she couldn&#39;t lay down, it started right away when she felt she had the bronchitis. Rash up and down and all over her arms: She then developed a reaction and had a rash up and down her arms, all over her arms. Felt the bronchitis symptoms right away. It was the weirdest thing and she couldn&#39;t lay down. Every time she would get up, she couldn&#39;t breathe. Went to the emergency room 3 times but was not admitted.  At one point, she had a rash all over her body. Her doctor thought it was MRSA. This happened a month into all of this. She got the vaccine 8 or 9 Mar 2021. This rash occurred some time in mid April. When it started, the rash was everywhere in her body. It was so severe, that they thought it was MRSA. Gave her another bout of antibiotics. She had sores that were opening all over her body. She then went to the Emergency room and they treated her there. The other time she went to the emergency room because she couldn&#39;t breathe. She had to sit in a Lazy boy chair for 2 months. The pulmonologist and the heart doctor couldn&#39;t find anything. When they though it was bronchitis, they treated her for 2 months with Prednisone. She got Candida&#39;s from the Prednisone. They put her on 27 medications total. The pulmonologist said it was not the lungs, it was the heart. She was put on medication to slow down the heart rate. It had been running about 119. The medication she was put on was Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. It slows down the heart rate, it has been so high. She was put on the medication 23 Apr 2021. It went so high. Her oxygen has been good. Her heart rate was never slowing down. She is still taking the Metoprolol, her rate is running like 118 and 108, it never slows down. The pulmonologist said it was not the lungs, its the heart and she is going to see him tomorrow for a follow up echo. She is so sick from so many medicines. Is still experiencing a lot of tiredness. It is the weirdest and is very strange. When she was laying down and couldn&#39;t breathe, the doctor said they felt like she was going into heart failure. The Echo didn&#39;t find anything wrong. It was a weird thing.  She talked to both of the doctors, the pulmonologist and the family doctor who said that it was too coincidental that it was from the Pfizer. The Echo was a week and a half ago. The family doctor read it sand it looked normal. The pulmonologist who ordered the test is going to check it tomorrow. Her family doctor said to not get the second shot. The other doctor said she could probably take it. She doesn&#39;t feel like herself. She is scared. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Event bronchitis like symptoms required a visit to Emergency Room for 3 times and Physician Office and has been to the family doctor at least 5 times. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) but had the flu shot in the fall. AE following prior vaccinations was none. Relevant Tests was none or Unknown. Caller states that she is overweight. Caller states that she is trying to get out of here to go to a doctors appointment. Caller states that she has the bottle, she will ask her spouse to read it since she can see better, the product is Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. On the bottle it also described the pill as Round white tablet 51:M18. Caller needs to obtain a magnifying glass. Caller states that she wants to give enough information to what happen to her. She states that the Manufacture is Mylan.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:00 in left deltoid at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, bilateral thyroidectomy in 2014. Family Medical History: Father died of lung cancer. Mother died of cardiac arrest in 1972. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for bilateral thyroidectomy. The patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 27Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

                                                my lower extremities went cold for an instant when they gave the vaccine but it quickly passed. Wait half an hour of post vaccination observation and it went well. On the return car the feeling of cold returned to me in my arms and legs. When I got home I felt good and I prepared something for lunch, when I started eating, around 3.30 pm (about an hour and a half after getting the vaccine) I started to feel bad, my heart was beating very strong and fast, I was gasping for air, dizzy. I used the oximeter and I saw that my heart rate was at 110 and kept going up and the oxygen was going down. I called 911 when the blood pressure monitor and oximeter reached the limit and started flashing, oxygen at 92 and pulses at 141. I thought I was dying. The 911 operator told me to lie down and wait for the paramedics and she stayed with me on the line. I also put ice on my chest. When they arrived my signs began to normalize. I can&#39;t quite remember what happened next that day.

First time 1&amp;1/2 hours after injection without any asthma triggers, then 4-5 times lasted a few minutes each time during first 24 hrs, coughed more frequently, only used my rescue inhaler 3x during the first 48 hrs, fine rash on my face the next morning, lasted 48 hrs.  I had body aches, chills , didn?t feel well for first 48 hours after the shot, ok now, just still tender at injection site, that is improving. Concerned I may have had a mild allergic reaction, worried about getting 2nd dose, but my doctor told me to take Benadryl prior to second dose &amp; have someone drive me to the appointment, and get the second dose.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 16Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose as the patient is a counselor, essential worker, in the health field but she got in because of age (COVID-19 immunization). Medical history included Subclinical hypothyroid (she takes no meds. Was diagnosed 10 years ago), allergies to Sulfa drug, seasonal allergies and sprained wrist. A couple antibiotics bother her stomach but she was not allergic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included estradiol, B12, calcium and glucosamine. Other medications included estrogen, vitamins, glucosamine supplements, and takes a cream for injury: sprained wrist, she doesn&#39;t know the name of it, it is an anti-inflammatory cream, she doesn&#39;t think any of that will do anything. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had the vaccine on 16Jan2021 Saturday and within 15 minutes (also reported as 20 minutes after shot and at 12:00), the patient experienced severe ringing in ears. She had severe ringing in her ears, it was really loud, and was still there. She can&#39;t seem to figure out if it was normal, what&#39;s causing it and could it be from the vaccine. It may have been anxiety because of that, but right after she heard ringing, there was a lump feeling in her throat on same day, like something was in her throat, she thought she had throat swelling, it lasted a couple of days, but she had no shortness of breath or anything. Ringing in ears was a lot worse in the morning, and gets better during the day, maybe because she was around noise, but it comes and goes, there are two separate sounds, one was a high pitched and continuous, the other one was lower pitched, a little fragmented, if she drew a picture, there would be little dust particles in the air, but the other is constant, she tried really hard to ignore, but it was driving her nuts. She is hoping it will go away. The lump feeling in her throat was gone, she was wondering if it was anxiety. It was mentioned, &#34;She gets nervous, gets a lump in her throat a lot&#34;, but this was really severe, but she saw a man being taken away in an ambulance, and that scared her, she was waiting in the waiting area, and saw that, so it scared her. Recovered completely from the lump feeling in her throat. Throat was normal in 2 days but ears ringing still there after 4 days. There was no treatment for the events severe ringing in ears and Lump feeling in throat. The outcome of the events severe ringing in ears was not recovered; event Lump feeling in throat and throat swelling was recovered in 18Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other event.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

                                                1 PM I received the vaccine and withing 5 minutes had a slight pain on the left side of my head which then continued to a pain in my neck. also left side, then back pain, then slightly short of breath. I remained in the waiting area for over a half hour and felt no worse, but did report it to the young woman at the exit who said that was odd and seemed the kind of response with the second dose. I presumed it might be due to my already having antibodies. As I continued my day those symptoms quickly dispersed and I felt fine, albeit with a light soreness at the site on my left arm. At approximately 6pm I felt very fatigued and rested until 10pm, when I began to have chills, a headache and nausea. My left arm was also so sore I could not lay comfortably. I took Tylenol and aspirin both at 11:30 pm and attempted to sleep, which was fitful and disturbing. I had strange neurological events, such as odd visions in my half sleep and bizarre semi dreams but could not waken. At 4:00 AM I finally was able to pull out of this state and the last thing in my mind was a conversation with someone trying to explain what was happening to me, in my mind not vocal, that was in Italian. That is my second language. All day I had unwanted words, ideas etc. floating about in my brain. I could no longer sleep and was very weak, had terrible head and body aches and my legs also ached terribly. I was also slightly nauseous.These were all symptoms, minus the disturbing neurological one, that I had with Covid. I was too weak to leave the bed until much later in the day. I am still having effects but much less and I am at the 72 hour mark. I remained at rest all day and ran a low fever, then again a fever

After an hour and a half, nurses took blood pressure and was very high, plus slightly elevated heart rate. Clinic called EMT who took blood pressure, was 180/110.  My normal BP is around 130/75.   Heart rate around 95 (normally 65).  I declined going to emergency room because I could breath, even though it was agitated and coughing a lot. I did not want to go where there might be a lot of sick people.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                About 10 minutes after the shot I felt a warm sensation inside my arm running all the way down to my arm and my hand went numb .  I waited a few more minutes then I was released.  Then 1/2 hour later my eyes were very sensitive to light I wore sunglasses. Then five hours after the shot I had chest discomfort on left side of my chest which felt like I was having a heart attack pain subsided then every 2 hours it came and went until the middle of the night. Then next day still having same chest pain. Then I had difficulty swallowing was choking so I called my doctor. I also had trouble breathing. Dr. Advised to go to ER if I needed to. I rested and rested and monitored myself. Blood pressure fluctuated somewhat. Still had chest pain and discomfort 24 hours after the vaccine. I had never had chest pain or discomfort before. It was quite alarming. Not being able to swallow was alarming also. Several years ago I had an allergic reaction to a cleaning problem some of the same symptoms it was very scary no heart or chest pain with that allergic reaction to a cleaning product that had bleach in the product.

Was sent to Urgent Care office where I got EKG, which showed no problems with my heart. Went home, weak.  Woke at 2:00 am with night sweats. When I got up I noticed swelling on face, throat, hands &amp; feet. Faint pink rash ran up both fore arms and I had welts rising on my wrists. Nurse line I called said to to to ER asap, Took me a few hours to find a ride, my throat was closing up more by that point. I could tell over a few hours that my throat was swelling up. Went to nearest ER where I was very mentally confused. They  gave me a shot of steroids and Benedryl.  Later that night I got chills and was VERY weak. Had night sweats again. After a few days of rest, am still weak.

                                                Patient was noted to have abrupt respiratory failure 2 days after taking the 1st dose. The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia secondary to acute CHF exacerbation. The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed 2 weeks prior to hospitalization that was noted to show a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%. At the hospitalization, her left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to decrease to 25-30%. Left heart catheterization was performed and showed no signs of ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease). Patient was started on Entresto 24/26mg PO BID and Toprol XL 50mg PO daily and was diuresed with Bumex 1mg IV daily and was noted to have improvement in respiratory symptoms for which she was weaned off of BiPAP 15/5 with FiO2 of 50% down to room air. Patient had repeat transthoracic echocardiogram ordered prior to discharge and was noted to have an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction to 48% prior to discharge. The only change was that the patient had the COVID-19 vaccination. Patient does not have any history of coronary artery disease or heart failure. Patient was worked up extensively for other etiologies of heart failure and none were found.

Two hours after receiving vaccine patient experienced a &#34;prickly sensation&#34; and broke out in red bumps on back, arms, wrists, stomach, legs, and behind knees. Bumps were red in color at itchy. Patient took a dose of diphenhydramine and that helped throat tightness, but did not relieve rash. Patient bathed in Dawn Dish soap, which helped to calm the itch temporarily. Rash has not completely gone away, as of 3/17/21 patient still suffers from itchy bumps on legs.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Next day (Thurs. 3/18) extreme pain in neck, chest and shoulder area, headache, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, brain fog, malaise. I thought it would pass. Friday I felt no better - by evening I felt swelling in my neck and chest area. Noticeable swelling in clavicle area on both sides. Saturday &amp; Sunday I rode it out until I could see my Dr. on Monday March 22. Dr. gave me a shot of steroids and a script for MethylPREDNISolone - 21 tablets. Today is Tuesday, March 23, 2021 and I feel much, much better. Dr. said to NOT get the 2nd shot and to report this reaction.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 07Mar2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy history to a of number of medication and things (I&#39;m prone to allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 07Mar2021, the patient received the first dose and she went to sit in the observation area for 5 minutes. The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose. The patient was asking for information about 2nd dose being given after 42 days. The patient stated that she has not had any more of those symptoms at all. The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                On-set on dizziness, severe pain and swelling in left arm. 6 hour later, severe pain shooting up my arm, radiating up my neck to my left ear. Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

                                                Started about 3am Saturday Morning March 6 with extreme pain between shoulder blades. Took 2 Advil and was able to go back to sleep. Woke in the morning feeling fine. Then started becoming ill early afternoon. Fever every day for 2 weeks. Nausea, vomiting, lose of appetite, extreme fatigue, headache, light sensitivity, rash, nagging slight cough and some nasal stuffiness mostly when talking (this might be because of the pollen) We were told it was an unidentified virus that would have to &#34;run its course&#34;. Even though we are vaccinated, we continue to quarantine because we provide child care for my grandson. There was virtually no circumstance where I would have been exposed to a virus. Also, my husband had to care for me because I could do almost nothing for myself and he did not contract the virus.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half. Confirmed she was not admitted just in the Emergency Room. On 04Mar202 the patient was at the hospital and was gasping for breath. The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her. On 10Mar2021 she was starting to feel a little bit better as regarded anaphylactic reaction, she has recovered with residual effects from the anaphylactic reaction. Confusion was improved but stull a concern. The outcome of anaphylactic reaction was recovered with sequelae, of headache, swollen lips, confused was recovering, of gasping for air, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, throat closing/restriction in her throat, sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips was unknown. Patient asked if there was a conclusion about the PEG and her anaphylactic reaction. Her second dose was scheduled on 25Mar2021. Patient stated that her PCP and the CDC recommend to not get the second dose. Caller wanted to know if the anaphylaxis could be worse in the second dose. The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life. Patient wanted to know if she can get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine after a certain amount of time after receiving the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, caller cannot get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine due to a reaction. As of 12Mar2021 patent stated she does not wish to be contacted any further.   A Product Complaint was filed.

By the time I was seen ~ 6:30p the reaction was subsiding before reaching phase 3.  All vitals were taken as well as an ECG and were normal except b/p was still high (167/80).  Diagnosis was allergic reaction and I was advised to take a 2 week

                                                She got the vaccine, and felt right away a wave of nausea that passed quickly.  She felt like she was going to have to throw up.  Then she came home, she lives about 5 minutes away, came in the door and right away she did not feel well, like she was coming down with the flu.  She felt tired, weak, started to feel great muscle fatigue, followed by muscle tightening, joint pain in her knees, ankles, shoulders, back,  neck, as well as headache (not real bad, manageable with Tylenol).  No fever, but does have chills.  She would say the biggest problem is the fatigue.  She has been taking Tylenol for the symptoms.  She has not called the doctor.  She is also light headed and has a little shortness of breath, but knows she has to lie down to get more rest before she can proceed to do anything else.  She also has had quite a bit of pain in the arm, but she managed that with a cold compress on it.

These symptoms were not as prominent the first week of the shot, but the following two weeks they were and even now there still some glucose and liver issues that may be the cause of being out of breath.

She can&#39;t drive due to the brain aneurysm so she laid down.  She had pain at the injection site and throat tightness for about 3 days, and she just generally did not feel good for about 3 days.  The chest pain lasted for about an hour.  She did not take anything for her symptoms.   On the 3rd day she felt better.  She is now afraid to get the 2nd vaccine due to her reaction.  She tried to call Pfizer to report this and ask for their advice.   She has contacted her allergist who is going to notify the college about the 2nd vaccine and they may send her up there.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6198, NDC number: 59267100001, Expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 65-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed about 40 years ago in 1981. Concomitant medications included budesonide, formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT) taken for asthma had for a number of years, keeps them on hand; and salbutamol sulfate (VENTOLIN CR) taken for asthma, had for a number of years. The patient got the first shot and she have asthma but forgot to tell them that she has asthma and no one asked her first. The patient got pretty sick on unspecified date and she is trying to figure out if this could be from the vaccine. On 06Mar2021, her lymph nodes in her throat swelled up and her throat was raw, painful, super red and she could hardly talk, it also created a lot of congestion in chest- the lobes. The swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. She wound up going to the doctor and they prescribed her an antibiotic which cleared the infection in her throat. Her symptoms started two days after she received the shot. She is supposed to get the second shot on Thursday 25Mar2021 and that&#39;s why she is calling to find out information on what other people reported as far as asthma patients. She is debating on getting the second shot. Initially caller states that for the most part, it cleared up and went away about three days ago, but then explains it is gradually getting better. Every once in a while, her throat feels dry and raw, but she drinks water and it feels better. At first, she did not want to really talk. She has asthma, the congestion never really goes away and it didn&#39;t really improve this time after prednisone like it usually does. She did not feel good on Friday, but on Saturday it got bad. Her side effects have improved from what they were then. The patient recovered from the event swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. The outcome of got pretty sick and throat feels dry was unknown and the outcome of the remaining events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Went to the gym Monday evening 4/12 -- while running the track and doing some exercising I became seriously short of breath and this lasted the entire 1 hour workout depending on what I was doing.  It took most of the night for the  tightness and burning  in my lungs to subside.  I dont feel out of breath now, but it still isn&#39;t quite right.  I did not have this issue after the 1st shot.  I have to admit tho that I have a pulmonary exam scheduled for April 22 because of being a former smoker, etc.  So, I dont know if the vaccine caused the problem or some underlying lung issue.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 23Mar2021 19:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing laryngopharyngeal reflux diagnosed about 5 years ago, ongoing anxiety, usually happens during stressful circumstances; diagnosed about 20 years ago and she had had the sensation of labored breathing, dry mouth, and accelerated heart rate then yes for work like with public speaking; sensitive: Sulfa drugs, aesthetic filler in her face and allergic reaction Hyaluronic acid filler collagen and she doesn&#39;t smoke and drink. Family history included daughter was diagnosed with psychotic episode and diagnosed with mental illness and it was stressful getting that under control and she was sensitive to medication and surgical procedures she doesn&#39;t tolerate narcotics. Concomitant medication included clonazepam (KLONOPIN). She reported that she was prescribed .125 of clonazepam and it was a dissolvable sublingual and she doesn&#39;t use it frequently as she has read about reliance and potentially addictive and she will take a walk or watch a boring video to try to get her mind off it. The patient previously took oxycodone hydrochloride; oxycodone terephthalate; paracetamol (PERCOCET) and she was sensitive to Percocet; and darvocet and experienced sensitive to Darvocet post surgery; and codeine, and vicodin and was sensitive to both drugs, advil and causes her stomach to be upset, shingles vaccine, HPV vaccine, chicken pox vaccine and got 1 pox from that about 15 years ago when it first came out. The only post-surgical medicine pain reliever she can take was Tramadol and more often than not she doesn&#39;t have to do anything beyond Tylenol extra strength. On 24Mar2021, 04:00, the patient experienced extreme chills, and anxiety accompanied with tight, shallow, and labored breathing. She had troubled breathing due to this. She mentioned that she went to the emergency room (ER) that morning. On 27Mar2021, the patient had emphysema and agitation. On 26Mar2021, early in the morning, she had the breathing issue that she mentioned first concurrent with agitation and anxiety like at same time with the extreme chills. The sensation of agitation was all combined together, it like hit out of the blue while she was getting ready to go to sleep. She stated that at 4am it hit her with a sudden bout of extreme chills and at the same time a sense of anxiety, it felt like she hit a wall and couldn&#39;t get a full breath. She stays up late but wasn&#39;t doing anything anxiety provoking, she thought she was reading recipes. She sat to calm herself as she was not sure if it was a reaction or anxiety at the initial reaction fueling it further so she tried to sort of lower everything in her system and was concerned it could accelerate and not subside. At the hospital, they took her in an exam room and did her vitals and she was there about 2-3 hours and it was early in the morning and at that point sometime they took a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work and at that point prior to that while she was waiting she was feeling a little better, the worst had subsided and she suggested she go and they asked her to stay since she was already checked in and to be seen. The doctor looked at the results and read the film and questioned about emphysema and she felt that was unrealistic reading as she doesn&#39;t smoke, doesn&#39;t drink and it&#39;s not in her genetic make up. The doctor told her lungs were showing a lot of air and she said maybe it was because she was gasping and they told her to take a big gulp of a breath and hold it to get the X-ray. The doctor suggested she see a pulmonologist and she didn&#39;t feel that was warranted. She contacted her general practitioner and they recommended she get the 2nd shot and had her see an allergist who also suggested she get the 2nd shot. The patient stated that she was not really overweight and doesn&#39;t drink and doesn&#39;t smoke and the allergist didn&#39;t mention but she saw in the paperwork that a side effect could be difficulty breathing. She had no swelling, body rash, dizziness or weakness. Since that episode, she periodically throughout the day, and she can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s anxiety or allergies or something but she felt labored breathing and tightness in her chest and can&#39;t get a full intake of breath. She reported that when she sleeps on her back the sensation disappears completely and when she sleeps on her side it reappears a little; 1-2 nights after, it woke her from sleep and she doesn&#39;t think she was dreaming about anxiety. She stated that she has never had anaphylactic if this should escalate what to do and she decided to go to the ER and they had her wait an additional 2 hours for a follow-up reading that was all clear, all fine, except emphysema thing which was again, she was just researching and forgot the medical term, she this it was hype aeration, too much air sucked in. Her general practitioner recommended she see an allergist for a 2nd opinion and was surprised she was up on anything and didn&#39;t mention side effect and the handout said it could be a possible side effect. She has to yawn a lotto get the air in. She does have laryngopharyngeal reflux prior and she clears her throat which is probably annoying and controls that through diet instead of taking Pepcid AC. She has had to clear her throat a lot but never had labored breathing or shortness of breath, that to get a full breath sometimes she has to yawn to get past that tightness of shallow breathing or labored breathing. On certain days she doesn&#39;t feel it and thinks it was done and she will have a spate and it happens and she thought there was something stressing and does a reality check and again it&#39;s that time of year and when she was taking her walk and walked past a certain block she started to wheeze from the pollen on an unspecified date and she called her allergist to see about getting something. She had a mask and that helped a little. Her allergies were not exacerbating on 23Mar2021 or 26Mar2021 but started the last few days and she has a wheezing cough that had an extended sort of wheeze at the end of the cough. Before her cough for LPR it was annoying throat clearing. After the vaccine, she took that walk through that one specific spot on her route she got to coughing and thinking she needs to call and get something prescribed something if anything if she gets the second shot it will address any of the side issues if they were related to allergies so don&#39;t have to contend. It was every night where she sort of feels it and she sleeps through the night so if it was tension related it subsides and can&#39;t distinguish what is emotional and physical but she was sleeping through the night and it was an indication that it was improving. She reported that when she visited her son and after she returned he told her he was unaware he had strep and didn&#39;t know it, he was asymptomatic and she had a sore throat and went to urgent care and had an exam and didn&#39;t have strep and doesn&#39;t know what it was but she was feeling better by the weekend. She was supposed to go back and everything was shutting and she didn&#39;t go. Maybe she was exposed and just had a mild thing while she was there. She was tested for Covid on 26Mar2021 and her result was negative, but they did not do an antibody test. She wanted to know if difficulty breathing was a common reaction with the vaccine, and if the side effects would be lesser after the 2nd dose since she already had a severe reaction after the 1st dose and if she should still receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine. She was concerned the 2nd shot will be more pronounced than the 1st and she doesn&#39;t want to go through that and it be more severe.  She has heard if you had that reaction you may have been exposed to Covid before and she may have been around people with Covid that had positives and she may have antibodies from an asymptomatic experience and it may do more harm than good and she should do the 2nd shot. She mentioned this to her allergist and was told if she has a similar symptoms to call and get a bronchodilator. She was onboard with that but wants to discuss it because she finds it hard to believe she was the only one that had difficulty breathing and was wondering what was the duration of this labored breathing. She was scheduled for the second dose 18Apr2021. Outcome of events sore throat was recovered on an unspecified date; and outcome of rest of events was unknown.

A 65-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Feb2021 (at the age of 65 years old) (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cancer. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, had no known allergies and did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA), mesalamine, prednisone and folic acid; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had her first dose of BNT162B2 on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced spasms in left arm and seizure. No other vaccines were administered within four weeks. In 2021, patient experienced spasms in left arm, ultimately leading to the left arm becoming completely numb after second dose. Patient went to emergency room because she thought it was a seizure. This happened twice. She also had shortness of breath ever since second dose. The events resulted in hospitalization for two days from an unknown date in 2021. It was unknown if any treatment was given. The patient recovered with lasting effects The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) with result of negative on 26Mar2021 (post vaccination). The outcome of the events was recovered with sequel.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 65-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8757) at the age of 65-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 31Mar2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date and no vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously took aspirin and experienced allergy which was described as deadly. She never took medications since she found that out at 16-year-old. The patient received her first shot on 31Mar2021 at a pharmacy and mentioned that she was not sick at the time of vaccination, but she had a violent reaction to it. When she received it, she didn&#39;t feel anything. People said you will get a sore arm, but she got none of that. Then in the middle of the night on Friday (02Apr2021) probably around 3:00, she woke up with acute pain on the left side, it was rib pain, she thought she cracked her rib. On the same day, she also experienced difficulty breathing, and didn&#39;t sleep at all. On Saturday morning (03Apr2021), when she woke up, she had nausea, a headache, and extreme fatigue, but wondered if the extreme fatigue was because she did not sleep. The nausea and headache went away 8 hours later, on the same day. On Sunday (04Apr2021), she was coughing and coughed up blood. When she coughed, there was blood in the mucous. She mentioned that she still has acute pain, she could not get comfortable. Her sister passed away in January and she had a 5 pm train she was supposed to catch, she was responsible for the funeral. She was thinking that if she went to a hospital, they would keep her for 24 hours, she could maybe make it to the funeral but that was questionable. By Monday (05Apr2021), the acute pain was gone, she still had a cough, there was still blood in the mucous, she has occasionally blood in the mucous. The cough has not gone away but she was getting better every day. The difficulty breathing continued until about 08Apr2021 (as reported), but she still has some shortness of breath, but nowhere near as bad. She consulted her notes and said she was at 30% on 03Apr2021 and she felt today that she was at 80% and every day she was a little better and better. She has to sleep upright, she was afraid to sleep flat, she slept in her chair, last night for 2 nights she slept upright in her bed. She probably could lay down, but she was more comfortable upright. Because she was sleeping upright, she was not fatigued, she was not sleeping well but she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with what was going on. The events did not result in emergency room or physician office visit. She is supposed to get her second dose on 21Apr2021but she did not want to get the second shot. She asked if she could wait and get the one shot from Johnson &amp; Johnson. She didn&#39;t know where to go anymore. The outcome of the event &#34;acute pain on the left side, she thought she cracked her rib/ rib pain&#34; was recovered on 05Apr2021, recovered on 03Apr2021 for &#34;nausea&#34; and &#34;headache&#34;, recovered on Apr2021 for &#34;extreme fatigue&#34;, not recovered for &#34;didn&#39;t sleep at all&#34;, and recovering for all other events.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 09:40 (Lot Number: EN6199) (at the age of 65 years old) as single dose (dose 1) for COVID-19 immunisation; and methylprednisolone (MEDROL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at short term increase of the Medrol dose (as reported), from  unspecified date to an unspecified date at 2 mg (for four years, as reported), then from unspecified date to 10Mar2021 at 6 mg, then from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021 at 8 mg, then from 14Mar2021 to unspecified date at 6 mg, for Lupus. Medical history included diagnosed with asthma initially exercised induced and now it is seasonal and was diagnosed years ago (states she has not had to use her Albuterol inhaler that much now because it is seasonal but she is doing more outside and is allergic to outside things so she tends to use the inhaler more if needed), right leg paresthesia (she did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine), autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder and patient stated that she has lost height. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus. She had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 1st dose and then three days later on 10Mar2021 at 16:00, she thought what is going on and had her tongue tip so irritated and a strange feeling that it was a tiny bit edematous, her lower lip was full tingling. She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn&#39;t swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red. The next morning on 11Mar2021, her upper lip was tingling and she did go see her healthcare professional in town and sent photos to her Rheumatologist. As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn&#39;t catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn&#39;t see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Events required a visit to physician office (No visit to the ER but did see her physician). The last action taken in response to the events for methylprednisolone was unknown. The outcome of the event had left clavicle pain under the clavicle was recovered on 12Mar2021; event has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red was recovered in Mar2021; outcome for the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 based on strong temporal association, but possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications cannot be completely ruled out.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He was treated according to sepsis protocol including antibiotics for bacterial infection for pulmonary infiltrates however it was felt the pulmonary infiltrates are more related with COVID-19 pulmonary findings. Eliquis was started for DVT. Medical Center had been contacted Dr was the pulmonary attending and discussion is documented below- Attending hospitalist spoke to Dr from Medical Center.  At this point they know that she has Wegener&#39;s granulomatosis involving her kidneys and causing her renal failure but they do not think that is what is going on in her lungs.  They have still trying to work-up her infiltrates.  She has it we obtain a nocturnal oximetry study.  She was reassured that the patient is on her normal oxygen rate despite the DVT in her leg.  She feels this should rule out a pulmonary embolism.  If the patient is doing well from cardiopulmonary standpoint tomorrow she should be able to go home on Eliquis and follow-up with the specialist.   She was continued on Monistat cream for 3 nights total.   At this point patient will not require antibiotics will continue on Decadron and may be discharged to follow-up with her specialist.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9269, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 (at the age of 65-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease, Alopecia, Alopecia areata, Asthma, Back pain, Heartburn, Pulmonary embolism. The patient previously took Diltiazem and experienced allergic reaction. Concomitant medications included biotin (BIOTIN) taken for alopecia, finasteride (FINASTERIDE) taken for alopecia areata, hair fall; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) taken as a supplement, calcium (CALCIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for an unspecified indication, albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) taken for asthma, clobetasol propionate (CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE) topical solution that I put in my scalp for my alopecia, tramadol hydrochloride (ULTRAM [TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE]) as Occasionally taken for back pain, lorazepam (LORAZEPAM) taken for PRN, for sleeping at night, rivaroxaban (XARELTO) Strength:20 mg taken for pulmonary embolism, esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE SODIUM]) as PRN taken for Heart burn, levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE) I take that because my thyroid was killed after radiation from having Hodgkin&#39;s disease cancer, Docusate sodium with Senna (DOCUSATE SODIUM &amp; SENNA) taken for an unspecified indication. It was also reported that the patient took, unspecified steroid injection in scalp for Alopecia. It was reported that, &#34;I received the COVID-19 Vaccine on 09Jan2021 and the second one on 29Jan2021 Lot number EN6198 and about two weeks, let me go back to my calendar about four day after the first one I had my oral surgery on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and the next, they gave me a narcotic, Norco for pain. I took four of them and it was making me sick, so I stop taking it. The next day I didn&#39;t feel well at all. I actually felt like I was through Pulmonary embolism and I have a history of that (Consumer was unsure hence, Pulmonary embolism was not captured as event). So, I called doctor&#39;s office, it was closed so we messaged him and Monday he called and said you are on blood thinners you are not going through PE, I think you have been through a lot with the COVID-19 Vaccine then you had oral surgery and here you took Norco and he just said, just let your body rest, so I try to feel better in the next few weeks. The next time I saw a doctor I mentioned this to her that was on 10Feb2021 and it was a dermatologist that I see for alopecia areata (History) and I told her I am having shortness of breath on an unspecified date and lot of fatigue and she said that could be related to the COVID-19 Vaccine, you need to report that and I thought okay, you know she said you need time to get to your doctor. I said, I did, And he told me that it wasn&#39;t PE I just need to give my body time to recover from everything. She said (withheld) something is going on, shortness of breath and the fatigue that you are having doesn&#39;t sound right. She looked, the next day she called me at home and she looked up some stuff on COVID-19 and she said I really think you should report this and you really need to call the doctor now. So, I called the pulmonologist so again he didn&#39;t want to see me, he said you are not going through PE and you need to see cardiologist. So next week I had an appointment with the cardiologist on 19Feb2021. They said I was in A-fib on an unspecified date and they put me on cardiac medications you know to try and to get me medically to convert back into sinus rhythm and that was in February. In March I had an allergic reaction to Diltiazem they switched me to Metoprolol and then two and half months later I was still in A-fib, they sent me to electrophysiologist and Monday I had a cardio version done and so since then I see the dermatologist again for my alopecia and she said, did you ever contacted Covid or you know Pfizer you know you got that paper, when you got the vaccine they give you piece of paper that had phone number on it, I really think you need to let them know everything that happened and its all been since COVID-19 Vaccine. So I am just reporting what I have been through and by the way I am in sinus rhythm now but I am still having symptoms shortness of breath and fatigue. I messaged my doctor yesterday and I am waiting for a response from the electrophysiologist to find out you know why, when I am out of A-fib why I am still having the same symptoms. I take Metoprolol (treatment) because I was in A-fib they are trying to medically convert me and right now my dose has been tapered because I am back in sinus rhythm. So in a month I will be off of it. &#34;Consumer further stated, &#34;No, I just wanted you guys to be aware because my one doctor really insisted that I should call you. I mean I don&#39;t know if the Covid-19 vaccine has anything to do with all this or not I am just letting you know as a courtesy. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included EKG: unknown result on an unspecified date in Dec2020, EKG: unknown result on an unspecified date in Mar2021 (echo my ejection fraction was 55% and labs were done like in December because then I will have my annual physical done). The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known safety profile of the vaccine BNT162B2 ,a temporal association between the event atrial fibrillation and administration of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.  Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The headache went away after the 3rd day, but the tiredness lasted for about a month or so.  She found it more difficult to breath.  Prior to this she had some problems breathing, but it got worse after she received the vaccine, pretty much right away.  She went to her doctor who sent her to a pulmonologist.  The pulmonologist sent her for a pulmonary function tests, and had a test that her oxygen dropped to 86 when she was walking.  In November she was having problems, and had a chest x-ray and did not get back to her until 2/8/21 and that she had an enlarged heart, but it got worse after the vaccine.   She was placed on oxygen on 3/26/21.  This has helped her.  She was not put on any nebulizers as they did not help much and is on Oxygen 24/7.   The tightness in her chest have gone away but does have occasional headaches possibly due to not using her oxygen at times.

                                                At about 4:15 pm which is 3.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced tightness, swelling in my throat, tingling, numbness of my face in around my mouth, red flushing of the skin in my upper chest and throat.  I took 2 Benedryl tablets and experienced symptoms for the next hour. They subsided by 5:30 pm . I was able to breathe and swallow during the whole episode. I had very similar reactions several times in June when I was for unknown reasons experiencing hives and had same response when prescribed Bactrim, and then Keflex because of a UTI. I had no further incidents with the chest, throat, mouth reaction since mid June until yesterday.  I had no adverse reaction to the vaccine until 3.5 hrs after receiving it. I feel this is because my body has some sensitivity, not that anything was done incorrectly in administration of the vaccine. All personnel were very attentive and careful that I observed.

It was difficult to swallow, but not difficult to breathe.  I took 25 mg of Benadryl and 4 hours later took 50 mg of Benadryl.  The swelling did not diminish, but did not get worse.  When I woke up the next morning, everything was back to normal.

                                                I receive my second vaccination for Covid on January 4, 2021.  Less than 36 hours later I experience a rapid heart rate (110 - 128) and shortness of breath not related to activity.   I had anticipated body aches, chills etc and did have those as well.  Over the course of 4 - 5 days those resolved but my tachycardia and shortness of breath have not.  I waited another week to see if it would improve and when that did not occur I made an appointment to see Cardiologist because quite frankly, I was fearful of my symptoms.  My lungs remain clear, I have no difficulty taking a deep breath and my SAO2 is high 90&#39;s.  I had my annual physical 1/18/2021 and my lab work was normal as was my EKG.  I have never had shortness of breath and my heart rate was normally in the 70 - 80&#39;s range at rest.  Doctor ordered testing and the results are in My Chart.  I had a Echo/Stress/Echo which was normal.  My EF was 60% and in spite of my extreme shortness of breath on the treadmill, there was no ischemia induced.  Bp was elevated initially and during the test but returned to 130&#39;s/70&#39;s in recovery phase.  SAO2 was 97% to 100%.  I did a home sleep study on 1/31/2021 with results pending.  Doctor stated there was nothing on my testing that would account for my symptoms.  At my initial visit (1/26/2021)he started me on low dose Cardezem 120mg to address my heart rate.  My heart rate has improved with Cardezem (increased to 240 mg 2/2/2021) but my shortness of breath with minimal exertion has not.  I believe Doctor plans to order a PFT next.  Because of the timeframe for new onset symptoms and my Covid 19 vaccination, I wanted to reach out to you for guidance.  ? Second Covid Vaccination 1/4/2021 ? Shortness of breath and tachycardia 1/5/2021 ? Scheduled appointment with Cardiologist for 1/21/2021 and it was cancelled and rescheduled for 1/26/2021 ?

                                                At 4:55, patient received a COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine. At the time of administration patient expressed she had experienced a previous reaction to a pneumonia vaccination (unknown time frame) and that she did not like to receive shots. She requested that the person administering the vaccine count down before giving shot. Patient appeared nervous and was breathing heavily before she received her vaccine. Patient was instructed to sit and wait 15 mins. after vaccine administration in case of an adverse reaction. At time of check-out from the pharmacy (15 mins. after vaccination), patient expressed to pharmacy intern that she felt a &#34;little dizzy&#34; and that she had experienced &#34;slurred speech&#34; immediately after having received the vaccine, however had not communicated this to pharmacy staff. Pharmacy intern immediately took patients blood pressure and it was 176/99 mmHg and 162/101 mmHg during first two blood pressure checks. The pharmacy staff requested patient to remain within the pharmacy premises so that she could be monitored for more time. She then was checked every 5-10 minutes for approximately 2 hours. During this time, she described vision changes, dizziness, and a strange &#34;fogginess&#34; around her head. Additional blood pressure monitoring was conducted for results of 158/100 mmHg and 195/100 mmHg. Pharmacy Manager discussed options with patient, including having her go to an Urgent Care facility or calling 911, so that paramedics could assess her. patient expressed she wanted to be taken to the hospital, therefore intern called 911. Paramedics arrived shortly after and determined patient had not experienced a stroke. Her neurological exam was negative. Paramedics stated that patient was most likely experiencing an allergic reaction. The paramedics then proceeded to take patient to the hospital at her request around 7:00 PM. Multiple pharmacists and pharmacy interns spoke with her during this time frame of ~2-2.5 hours, took her blood pressure, and assessed her condition.

                                                Patient received vaccine on 2/17/21 at approx. 1105, began noticing adverse symptoms at approx. 1115.  Patient reports symptoms are similar but slightly worse than what she experienced with 1st dose.  Patient reports throat tightness, lip and tongue tingling, and having slight trouble swallowing.  Patient reports she did see her physician prior to receiving 2nd dose and was recommended to take PO Benadryl prior to 2nd dose, which patient did.  Patient was closely monitored for an additional 15 minutes (approx. 45 mins. in total).  While patient was waiting she also took another PO Benadryl which was her own medication.  Paramedic was also on site and monitoring patient.  Patient reported her symptoms were beginning to resolve and she felt well enough to go home.  Patient refused to be assessed fully in the ER and went home on her own.  Advised if she notices any worsening to symptoms to seek emergency care, patient verbalized understanding.

                                                Throat swelling, racing heart, head throbbing, chest tightness, slight dizziness, and face flushing. These symptoms came in waves and is a normal reaction I get with medication I am sensitive to. However because I not having a normal reaction, I was told to go to an emergency room for a EKG. I knew this wasn?t a heart event, but a reaction to the vaccine. It is a normal reaction for me. I?ve dealt with it most of my life.

                                                My lymph above my breast on left side became sore and it became difficult to take a deep breath. A couple of days later, the pain continued over to my right side also and same difficulty getting a deep breath. For awhile, the pain was in my right armpit too. Put warm compresses on areas and it helped a bit. My sister looked up info on the internet and found that ?Aleve? might help the pain, which it did. Called the  doctor?s office and they were not very helpful. The information my sister got from the internet was of more help. The difficulty getting a deep breath lasted 2 weeks.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

                                                After getting the  second Pfizer vaccine, I experienced shortness of breath. Riding my bike the shortness of breath was noticeable as I had to walk up hills I normally ride up and I was winded.  I went for a complete nuclear stress test with a known cardiologist and got a completely normal heart reading.  My heart is healthy, but I am experiencing shortness of breath all the time, more so when I exercise. My cardiologist said that even though there is only anecdotal evidence, other people have complained about symptoms lasting after the second shot and he recommended that I see how I feel in a month from now, although as an active person, I feel anxious about my symptoms.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Feb2021 (received at the age of 66-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold sores, 2 knee surgeries, and ADD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) from an unspecified date and ongoing (diagnosed at 30-years-old). Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and other regular medication. The patient received first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and developed numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye on 26Feb2021.  It felt like she had received a lidocaine injection.  Her doctor said this can happen with RNA vaccines, affect the 7th cranial nerve and develop Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She was prescribed Valacyclovir 1mg and has taken it for 3 days.  She wants to know what the other Bell&#39;s Palsy cases were like. She wants to know what their treatments were. Her doctor said it was okay to receive her second dose at 8am on 20Mar2021 but she wants to do her due diligence and see if there is a case report or study on these patients that developed this side effect. The patient further explained that she had her first dose on 26Feb2021 and was she was there for the 15 minutes for observation. On her way home, the right side of her mouth and the right side of her nostril were numb like Novocaine that you get at the dentist. She said that the numbness traveled up the right side of her jaw to her ear and then over to her right eye. When she got home, she told her daughter and she said that she thought it was because she volunteered all day and was worn out and anxious (26Feb2021). She said that she slammed water and ate crackers and after about a 1.5 hours she started to feel better. She said that she then she called her physician and the doctor told her that it was flaring the nerve root like bells palsy and that it is a RNA Virus. She said that she was placed on some medication for it, but was wondering if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She said that the doctor asked her if she had previously had cold sores and she said yes. The caller said that her doctor said that it is exactly what that is. The patient stated that she was also short of breath on an unspecified date, but thought it was from fear and anxiousness. She does not know if it was from fear and anxiety or from the vaccine. She said that the doctor told her to take the medication 3 days before and 3 days after her second dose. She clarified that the doctor put her on Valacyclovir HCl 1Gm tablets 1 a day. She said that she broke out with fever blisters on 02Mar2021. She really did not think anything of it until speaking with friends in the medical field and they told her to follow up with this. She added that the fever blisters are healing and only a tiny bit left. It is at the scab and end of healing. Outcome of numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye was recovered on 26Feb2021. Outcome of fever blisters was recovering. Outcome of other events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number not reported), via unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 01May2021 (at the age of 66 years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included a &#34;heart condition&#34;, asthma, acid reflux, hiatal hernia, and being &#34;allergic to a lot of medications&#34;, reporting that she previously had to carry an epinephrine (EPIPEN). The patient had unspecified concomitant medications. The patient stated that immediately after the first dose, she started not feeling good (01May2021), and by the time she got home, she was really having some breathing problems (01May2021).  She was monitored at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after administration, but did not report to them, because she did not know what to tell them. She a history of asthma, so she treated with her inhalers, and &#34;it eased off a little bit&#34;.  She reported she was really hurting, so she took a 5 mg dose of prednisone tablet. She also reported horrible acid reflux later that night (01May2021), which can trigger her asthma, she took some aluminum hydroxide/ magnesium hydroxide/ simethicone MYLANTA and felt much better.  She slept propped up, took another dose of MYLANTA this morning, and was feeling better today, but not 100%. She wanted to know if the vaccine can cause acid reflux or asthma exacerbations? And if she should expect the same, but more severe reactions after the second dose?  It was also reported, that after the vaccine, the patient stated for fifty minutes maybe she had what was like pressure in her chest (unspecified date May2021). She did not know what she was feeling, so she did not say anything. So she came home, and just as the day got work more the pressure, she had asthma and saw what was happening was an asthma attack, which started hurting really bad like an asthma attack, so she took her inhalers, and it eased it off a little bit. Then it just kept worsening. She was also a heart patient, so when she had asthma, some times it mimicked a chest pain. She was thinking if it was affecting chest pain or was it asthma, so had some prednisone, 5mg of prednisone (treatment) that she had to take for her asthma. It did not help last night (further clarification unknown). She was trying to get to the hospital. She was wondering if this shot had aggravated her acid reflux and aggravated her asthma (both 01May2021). When the patient went to bed, she got some aluminum oxide/ magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX), big dose of MYLANTA, and that eased it off. Before she got the shot, she felt fine; she would have no symptoms, and then when she got the shot  &#34;mean it went 30 minutes later and I just felt this and I still did not know what it was&#34;. Her husband told her to sit down. She did not know what was wrong, she just felt different. She thought it caused her asthma to act up. The patient stated that last night (01May2021), her blood pressure was sort of up to like 185 over 186, &#34;but I think it was because I am extreme so bad by then I am and my chest in my chest and then I finally said okay let me take so (incomplete sentence) my acid reflux so let me take some MYLANTA so I take calcium carbonate/ magnesium hydroxide (ROLAIDS) and I immediately stop that pain that must be my acid reflux making triggering my asthma it is, I was like, I was in pain last night (01May2021), just administered for my asthma between my chest and my back for stabbing pain (01May2021) and that caused sometimes when I have heart condition, I always like it is my heart or it is my asthma what is it? and I got this one okay I will take a dose of MYLANTA just to make sure see that will help come down&#34;. The patient felt a lot better today, but still felt sort of wheezy (May2021) &#34;like you know when you have asthma&#34;. Her bad asthma she would just get a wheezy sort of just heaviness in breathing. The patient was due to get the second shot on 22May2021. On an unspecified date, the patient had: a lab test &#34;but have results before I had the following to chest by giving lastly&#34;, and routine blood work-cholesterol and all.

                                                Within 5 minutes of vaccine administration, patient appeared shaky and reported tightness in throat. Pharmacy staff suspected anxiety/panic attack as symptoms appeared to be triggered by pharmacist stating that patient must remain on site for a 15 minute observation period in case of an immediate and serious reaction. Out of an abundance of caution, EMS was called and reported to the pharmacy. EMS stated airway was clear, and patient did not appear to be in anaphylaxis. Because patient was wheezing, epinephrine was administered, and patient was taken to local hospital. Patient was discharged around 10:00pm (approximately 5 hours after the incident).

                                                get sore arm; Anaphylactic reaction; Shortness of breath; look miserable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 09May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177; Expiration Date: Aug2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma since she was 8 years old, when she was a child her asthma was really bad and then she would say after 2004, she would say she went to chemotherapy and then 2005 her asthma got a lot better, didn&#39;t have it really bad as she used to, one doctor said he had heard that from patient they go through the chemo and their immune system change, she carried her little inhaler, but she don&#39;t have (incomplete sentence), she had asthma but not really bad, she was not like walking around every day with asthma packs but she have asthma and she keep little inhaler, for eg; if there is lot of pollen in air then she will need to take out her inhaler; breast cancer; seizure; hypertension, high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included zonisamide taken for seizure, lacosamide (VIMPAT) taken for seizure, losartan taken for hypertension, atorvastatin taken for high cholesterol, all start and stop date were not reported. Some years ago when she in 2005 when she was on the end like she said its 2005 and she was right on the end of being treated for breast cancer. she was taking, the doctor put her on Tamoxifen and she woke up one morning to really short of her breath and she thought it was her asthma, so the lady she was staying with said you look miserable and she said let her get back on the store and have her take her to the ER she said call now and it turned she had a blood clot in her lungs but &#39;Dr PRIVACY&#39; (not spelled) who was treating her, he was a cancer specialist he said PRIVACY she was so proud of her, he said that she got to take you off the Tamoxifen, it was that Tamoxifen that caused blood clot in your lung. A blood clot in the lungs was the side effect of the Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen was one of the drug they give women who have had breast cancer and are right at the end of the treatment and put us on Tamoxifen and she ended up with a little bit of blood clot in her lungs. He said that was one of the effects of Tamoxifen. So, that was like in 2008, 2009 it was 12 years ago, could have 11 years ago but this goes to show her body may have potency for allergic reaction. The patient stated she had short of her breath because she did have allergic reaction shortness of breath with Pfizer Vaccine first dose at a pharmacy yesterday 09May2021, had been given Prednisone so. She did shortness of breath about 45 minutes after she took it because we had to sit there about she would say we were sitting there about 20 minutes and he finally said well you all can get up and leave and then about say 15 minutes later she start getting shorter and shorter of her breath. &#34; The patient stated, she just needed to Pfizer certainly reporting acting as if this was just a completely safe vaccine there are unsafe reaction to this vaccine so she wanted to get this going okay, she was 66 years old she end up going to the ER,  they didn&#39;t give her Epipen&#39; (not clarified further) so that&#39;s when she started to get sore arm, she had an anaphylactic reaction to this drug. Now if this was the wrong number to report it to then she would call to get to agency she needed to report it to. she was on the Prednisone now. Sometimes it was difficult for she to breathe, so the emergency room they &#39;have&#39; (not clear) she up with enough medication now, so she had got plenty of medication now.&#34; She stated it just happened yesterday, when she saw on the news that they hadapproved it to be for children and it bothers me that they, this was  just a break simple drug no very safe. Yesterday when she  first started getting short of her breath she was in denial and didn&#39;t want to because she was really started shorter of my breath and the pharmacist that administered he even said he knew that it was the reaction to the drug because she was full animated before he administered the vaccine because she  was sitting there talking to the two ladies and you know jabbering and remember the days because of flu shots and how the government used it, they didn&#39;t wanted knowledge when people talked about how the flu shot (Unspecified Shot) made them sick and she  was just jabbering so he knew it was reaction to the vaccine. Here was this lady &#39;who was so animated and talking and now she can barely hold her head up&#39; (not clarified further). Patient confirmed Prednisone as treatment. As for the treatment patient stated, &#34;Took the 2 Prednisone and what happened was, if I wasn&#39;t even going to go get Prednisone, but the shortness of breath was going transient, what I mean is first of all I talk and I do fine and then all of a sudden I get short of my breath again and then looked like I had a good night and then I woke up and my lungs tightened up again and then earlier this evening I called on phone and tell them I have to take Prednisone because my breath was getting short again.&#34; Prednisone details were 10 mg 4 tablet by mouth every day for 5 days then 2 tablet every day for 3 days, so 1 every day for 2 days. As for other medications: patient stated she was on seizure medications daily. She was on treatment for asthma, she had a little inhaler she keep in her purse for eg; if there&#39;s pollen in the air, when she got out and then maybe get short of her breath if there&#39;s pollen in the air yeah she need her little inhaler, but she was on daily treatment for her seizures she was on 800 mg a day for the seizures, Zonisamide and Vimpat. In fact that day she wouldn&#39;t take any other medication because she thought well she was not taking any other medication&#39; (not clarified further) to mix it with this vaccine. Normally she take the 25 mg for high blood pressure but she won&#39;t take it that day she think it&#39;s called Losartan or something. Little bit of high blood pressure they cut that down because her blood pressure had gotten, she had some high blood pressure yes it&#39;s called 25 mg of Losartan. Yeah she thought, she won&#39;t take it that morning because she though well just lay off all of that stuff that day and so we can take the vaccine, &#39;mix none of that with vaccine&#39; (not clear), that day the only medication that she was taking was her seizure medication (Zonisamide and Vimpat) because you can&#39;t skip medication but the Losartan and Atorvastatin that&#39;s for high cholesterol she won&#39;t take that either that day. The asthma now, she did have asthma but it&#39;s a kind of that&#39;s one the things that you have it but you are not on daily medication for it. She do keep her inhaler with because sometimes she go in buildings where they have air condition on really high and it gets to her lungs. In fact when this happened and the guy wanted to call 911 we decide well let&#39;s see if new inhaler (Unspecified Medication) worked and it wasn&#39;t quite rescuing her lungs like it should.&#34; For Vimpat details patient stated, it&#39;s a pill (formulation not clarified further), it&#39;s 100 mg so she took one in the morning and one in the evening. For Zonisamide details patient stated, Each capsule was 100 mg, so she take two 100 in the morning and two 100 before she go to bed.&#34; As for lab Test patient sated, &#34;Just had a MRI but no dye just the plain MRI with no dye or anything. Had MRI without dye, no dye.&#34; hen probed for the MRI result, consumer stated, &#34;No because this was the seizure doctor ordering that.&#34; As for date of MRI patient stated, &#34;That was on the 4th I think, but what was the MRI have to do with having a reaction to this vaccine, because the MRI. Doctor want specifically had no dyes it was just no dyes but that was the doctors that treat me for seizure he wanted the MRI done, yeah this was the 4th of May.&#34; When probed if adverse events are improved, worsened or persisting, consumer stated, &#34;today you know just a short of the breath I am really short of my breath but now when I have taken the Prednisone I am breathing a lot better, breathing so much better yes, you can mark improve (not clarified further).&#34; The outcome of the event shortness of breath was recovering, of other events was not recovered.

A 66-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown; Expiration Date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included has asthma that was controlled for years and allergies that were controlled. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She got the first dose of the vaccine on 19Apr2021 and was okay, except her arm was hurting/ soreness in the arm for a few days approximately on an unknown date in 2021. She was ready to get her second dose on 10May2021 but the week prior to that, approximately in 2021, 2 weeks after the first dose, she started getting sick. Caller reported that in to that third week, approximately in May2021, she experienced shortness of breath, coughing and body aches and it all hit her like a ton of bricks. She was feeling great but then was feeling Covid symptoms. The caller was totally tired, she was also waking up and having to go back to sleep on unknown date in 2021. The caller called the nurse line, and they told the caller to go into the emergency room. They did a covid test first thing because a lot of the symptoms were Covid symptoms. On an unknown date in May2021, they did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on the caller because she was having something going on in the middle of her chest. The caller had a covid test in the emergency room and it was negative. They did some blood tests, and they did not see anything bad other than a respiratory infection and said come back if it gets worse. That&#39;s what they thought it was and they sent the caller home. She also had heart palpitations on an unknown date in 2021 and stated she needs to go see a cardiologist. The caller was apprehensive about getting the second dose right now because she was still not feeling well. She does not know what is going on with her body. She was there in the ER on a Friday and asked if she should get the shot on that Monday or Tuesday and the ER doctor said to get it. However, she talked with the Immunization department and they said not to get it if she is not feeling well. She kept rescheduling the vaccine because of her symptoms. She stated she was feeling like she was 99 years old. She had an appointment with her primary care provider this week and they said they will listen to her heart. She was still delaying getting the second shot and was thinking it was best not to get it. She stated she read that adverse reactions usually occur within the first hour. The immunization clinic said to delay the second shot, that the caller could delay it up to 31 to 42 days. The caller has not been feeling well for weeks. The caller is still having difficulty breathing and has been taking her asthma inhaler. The caller was feeling great except the soreness in her arm that went away. The caller was seeing her primary care provider this week because she doesn&#39;t know if she needs to have her heart checked out further. The facility wouldn&#39;t give the caller her second dose at her scheduled appointment because she was feeling bad, so she has kept delaying it.  The outcome of the event soreness in the arm/her arm was hurting was recovered on unknown date in 2021. The outcome of the events shortness of breath, not been feeling well/she is feeling like she is 99 years old and felt so bad, not been feeling well was not recovered. The outcome of the events respiratory infection, something going on in the middle of her chest, heart palpitations, coughing, swelling on arm, body aches, sick, totally tired and waking up and having to go back to sleep was unknown.   Follow up attempts needed. Information related lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Starting around a week after the second vaccine, I began to be more aware of my asthma. There was more awareness of SOB and coughing. In April, when seasonal symptoms started, I had a reaction that is not typical for me. I had asthma symptoms significant enough to make me use inhalers that I have not used for several years. I was going to take prednisone, but my inhalers kicked in so I didn&#39;t use it. Usually, when the pollen would flow, I would have dry eyes, or running eyes. I did not have any other allergies besides my asthma and breathing difficulties. All of this resolved after a couple of weeks and I&#39;m no longer using my inhalers. I can still notice my asthma more than usual though.

A 66-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient experienced tightness in the back of her throat that lasted for 30 minutes afterward and described it as a feeling like she &#34;had to clear my throat&#34;, arm pain, some tiredness, might have just been nervous. Seriousness was reported as no. It was reported that patient calling on behalf of her granddaughter, who is 22 y/o and has read about the Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine causing infertility. Is this true? Reported that she stated that she doesn&#39;t get vaccines very often, and might have just been nerves contributing to the tightness in her throat. Is this something she should mention before getting her second dose? Reminded caller to let vaccination site know of her previous experience, may want to monitor her longer after vaccination. The outcome of event (tightness in the back of her throat that lasted for 30 minutes afterward) was recovered on un unspecified date and outcome of events (arm pain, some tiredness, i might have just been nervous) was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                On 3 May, 15 minutes after receiving my 1st Covid vaccine injection, I developed a deep, all-over body tremor. (Batch: ER7449-024, date: 3/5/21, time: 10:49am - given). I do have a history of essential tremor, but the tremor was far worsened after receiving the vaccine.  I didn?t report it to staff at the time, as it wasn?t anaphylaxis and I told them I was ?OK? when told my wait time of 20 minutes was up. I had had a similar tremor response to salbutamol during lung function test Dec 2020. It took hours to resolve after the lung function test, but it did eventually go, so I assumed the tremors after the vaccine would also be transitory.  I noticed feeling spacey/dopey (brain fog) when I was walking to my car. I attributed it to a ?normal? vaccine response, as well as a headache later on that day.   However, the tremor and brain-fog never dissipated, in fact, it got worse as the days went on.   The brain-fog is probably now the most debilitating and distressing lingering effect. It feels like my head has been jostled all night - and the feeling is as if I have prescription glasses on that aren?t quite the right prescription.  There was an immediate and noticeable increase in the tremor in my neck/head, a significant increase in the resting tremor in my right forearm, and a ?new? tremor in my core which feels like a loss spinal cord stability, which manifests in what feels like a wobbly oscillation of my core. It is transitory.  I?ve felt unbalanced and ?fumbling?, but not ?dizzy?, and not tired. Within a few days I developed numbness on my palate (nasopalatine nerve?), and felt tightness through my neck and numbness through the left side of my face. This is still on going, though getting better.  Within the first several days (prior to medication: propranolol and lorazepam) the tremors were so bad I had trouble sleeping , and felt like my legs were ?fizzing?. I?ve been trying to use as little medication as possible, but when I have a bad night?s sleep, the tremors and brain-fog are worse the next day.  After several days, the tremors and brain-fog prompted me to contact Healthline, with them offering no solution, other than to get the next vaccine, which I have held off on, until I find some answers.  I?ve reported my reaction to Health Covid Reaction website on 7 May 2021 - four days after Covid vaccination. Report Reference AEFI002846. Since I?m still having effects, I have recently sent additional information to The Centre for Adverse Reactions in Dunedin (attn: to Dr) to add to my initial report.  The evening of 12 May I had an onset of severe pain in my right lung causing shortness of breath, and which felt like pleurisy. It took 4 days to resolve. I have no idea if this is related.  I?ve had some pinpoint, very short-lived headaches, but they don?t last long. I?ve also felt my speech became somewhat forced/slurred, particularly the first few weeks. I?m struggling with short-term memory - doing dumb things, forgetting things, easily distracted - and sometimes feel somewhat ?confused?, struggle with the sequence of simple things, particularly if I?m having a bad day of brain-fog.  The first week or so, I would get a loud buzzing in one ear which go within a minute or so. I do have a constant high-pitched tinnitus going on. For several weeks I felt as if something was moving inside my right ear canal.   I stopped the medication on 3 May because I was feeling so foggy and couldn&#39;t attribute the feeling to the drugs or the reaction. While the tremor is reducing, I now see that I still have brain fog, tinnitus, and insomnia (with my legs feeling like they are &#39;fizzing&#39; at night).  I have windows of feeling OK, which gives me hope that this will eventually resolve. I?ve attempted to continue regular exercise, but never feeling quite 100%.

A 66-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) via unspecified route of administration, on 22Apr2021 as single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history of patient included Type 2 diabetic and small herniated disc. Concomitant product included medicine for diabetes (Not specified). Patient received first dose of vaccination on 01Apr2021 at the age of 66 years. There was no family medical history. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient experienced Back pain (a thousand times worse)/severe pain/Pain starting on back and wrapping around, couldn&#39;t hardly move, Couldn&#39;t hardly take a breath and It&#39;s hurting down into her stomach on Apr2021. The reporter was calling on behalf of sister in law. Prior to receiving vaccine had already experienced back pain. The patient received first vaccine dose on 01Apr2022, back pain felt was different than previous pain. Patient received second dose on 22Apr2021 and back pain was described as &#34;a thousand times worse&#34;. Reporter learned of this information approximately 01May2021. Her sister in law got the vaccine because she stays with her wife and her wife just had triple bypass. So she signed her sister-in-law up and got her the vaccine and she and her wife had already had the vaccine and they did not have any issues. Prior to her sister in law getting the vaccine she had a little bit of a back issue which they knew was a small herniated disc. She had some issues off and on. The patient got the second booster and from there it was down hill. It was like it amplified a thousand times. She thinks it&#39;s a side effect or some type of combination between the vaccine. Somehow the vaccine has done something, but she can&#39;t figure out what. She knows it has done something to cause her immune system to make it worse. She thinks it was initiated by the vaccine. She states hopefully this does not impact her job at all. She does not think it will, but she is concerned for her sister-in-law. The vaccine seems to correlate with the back pain. She didn&#39;t say anything until probably the second week or so after she got the second one. The first, she was kind of like, I think it&#39;s doing something, but she wasn&#39;t sure. Then when she got the second one, it amplified it and then she was like yeah, it&#39;s got something to do with it. It&#39;s bad. She states her sister-in-law is a very strong lady. This morning she went in to see her and she couldn&#39;t even hardly move or take a breath. She&#39;s trying to move around. She wants to know if this is going to effect her job. She states the pain is starting in the back and wrapping all the way around. It&#39;s hurting down into her stomach. The events were persisting and she&#39;s not sure how much worse it can get. Her doctor suggested that she get it. She feels bad now because she kind of talked her into getting it as well because she is a type 2 diabetic. Her diabetes is controlled with medicine. She had a test prior to vaccine about the back problem.  She has a very high pain tolerance. She was now hurting to a point where she is about ready to go to the emergency room. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered and no vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no relevant tests. There was no investigation assessment. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Three days after the second dose of the vaccine I had a flare up of my Asthma and my Fibromyalgia. I was having trouble breathing and my Asthma was more severe than normal. I went to my doctor and I was given a new inhaler and some Steroids.  It was difficult to breathe for one week after that. I also had some nerve pain and my bones felt like they were throbbing. It was a flare up of my Fibromyalgia and I was given some Alpha Lipoic Acid 600mg and it has really helped with my nerve pain. My fibromyalgia normally flares up a couple of times a month.  This time it was much worse and I was bedridden for two days. It started three days after the shot and lasted for three days.

                                                On my way home from receiving the vaccine, I felt slight numbness in my lips (no further swelling, etc.).  Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

Noteworthy, I had  as a precaution taken prednisone 20mg p.o  about 2 hours before the injection.  I had to take more  later that afternoon because of symptoms. I then seem better but several times since the vaccine I have needed to uses the inhaler  and take prednisone  more than I have except after an infection about 6 years ago that precipitated similar symptoms to now. Today I had a flare significant enough that except for covid I might have gone to the ER or urgent care.

                                                On Christmas day I was working and then you started feeling like a pinching in my chest, like when you are going to catch a cold, that went on through the afternoon. In the afternoon I started with light headache and dry cough (intermittent), no temperature. I did not take anything for it and continued working. When I got home, I felt weak and was supposed to join my family for Christmas and decided not to go. And went to sleep. The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

                                                she felt so tired; her breathing was heavy and felt tight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL9262), at age 67 years, injection into the left upper arm/deltoid, first dose on 27Jan2021 14:00 at single dose, for COVID-19 vaccination. Ongoing medical history included diabetes diagnosed more than 10 years ago and high cholesterol diagnosed around 10 years ago, maybe longer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were unspecified maintenance medications because she is diabetic and has high cholesterol. She said that she has been taking these medications for a long time though already. Patient was a retired registered nurse that was calling about the COVID-19 vaccine and reported that she had the first dose injection on 27Jan2021 at 14:00 and 2 hours after she got home, she felt so tired that she did not feel like moving and her breathing was heavy and felt tight. Patient said that her breathing feeling heavy and tight did not last too long, maybe an hour then went away. Her tiredness, felt so tired lasted through the day and whole night and she was fine and completely recovered after waking up in the morning. For breathing feeling heavy and tight: She clarified that it lasted from like 14:00-17:00 yesterday 27Jan2021. Patient wanted to know with the symptoms she had is it contraindicated to get the second dose? She was reading the information about the injection and seemed like the symptoms are part of it. The outcome of the events was recovered, for felt so tired was on 28Jan2021 and for breathing was heavy and felt tight was on 27Jan2021. Case was reported as serious with other medically important condition as seriousness criteria. The reporter assessed the events she felt so tired and her breathing was heavy and felt tight as related to the suspect drug COVID-19 Vaccine.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported events cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association.

                                                One of our Greenfield patients called today (2/12/21) to discuss the adverse effects she experienced following her first dose of the COVID vaccine (received last Friday, January 29). The patient indicated that several hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced pronounced dyspnea and tachycardia. She stated these symptoms lasted throughout the weekend and were severe enough to prevent her from conducting her daily activities. The patient mentioned that, at one point, she nearly passed out while showering from not being able to catch her breath. The patient reported that she contacted her PCP for guidance, who instructed her to visit the ER for a thorough workup; however, the patient stated she did not follow these orders due to concerns of having a high copay. When speaking with her today, the patient assured me that her symptoms have since resolved.

                                                I received the 2nd Covid injection.  I went to the 15-minute waiting area.  The waiting area was full, so my husband and I were standing.  I stand and work every day, so this was not difficult.  I texted my daughter, who is a hospital employee, and told her that we had a super experience with no wait and had already received our 2nd dose.  However, 5 to 7 minutes after the injection, I SUDDENLY felt dizzy and weak and had to sit down.  Within a minute or so, I could not stand or open my eyes.  The weakness made it difficult to breath or talk.  My husband had to lift me up into a wheelchair.  I was taken to the ER.  For the longest time, I could not even open my eyes or talk above a whisper. After 4 hours, I was able to get my eyes open and talk better.  I, gradually, was able to move my hands and feet.  Last of all, I could move my hips and walk.   It was as if my body had been put to sleep.  I could feel everything but my body wouldn?t move.  As it wore off, my face and limbs felt slightly tingly.  I was, basically, fine after 5 hours other than being tired from the experience. The doctors had no explanation for what happened and said it must be an emotional response to getting the shot.  They wrote that I was not exerting enough effort to move my body.  One said that I was hyperventilating when I pulled my mask up to breathe after he told me to hold my leg in the air.  Though I tried, I was too weak to hold my leg up and it fell to the bed. The doctor told me that I should not tell anyone about what had happened or people would not come to get the Covid vaccination.  He obviously knew that SOMETHING had happened that I couldn&#39;t control but he didn&#39;t put that in his report!

Then I started to have tightness in my chest and used my albuterol inhaler.   I was still having symptoms an hour later so took Benadryl 25 mg.  During the night I woke up with mild wheezing and used my inhaler again.  Throughout the next 2 days, I continued to have these symptoms (except for wheezing) off and on.  Today, I still have some symptoms but not as often or severe.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                About ten minutes after the shot, my heart suddenly started pounding, I was panting, and I got very hot.  Then tingling went all over my body, even in my lips.  At one point, I felt close to fainting.  The pharmacist lady gave me cold water (I asked for it), and I just sat there for quite a while.  Gradually my heart rate came down, and I got cold, but the tingling kept going, and I felt somewhat weak.  Since I didn&#39;t want any epinephrine (it affects my heart), and I didn&#39;t think I was so bad that I needed an ambulance, after being there nearly an hour my husband drove me home.  There I took some liquid Benadryl, and that seemed to help with the tingling.  I just took it easy after that.  Considering my reaction tothe first dose, I will NOT be getting the second one.  I don&#39;t need to consult with a doctor to decide that.  It was somewhat frightening because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was going to get.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

This symptoms did&#39;nt alarm me at first since I have this asthma  for couple years. Then after a  week from receiving my second dose vaccine in 02/28/21, my symptoms got worst. In additon to having SOB, wheezing , coughing I developed generalized hives. I started taking steroids started 03/13/21 to ease my symptoms. Today I started feeling better and able to walk for 30 minutes without any problems. Hives also subsided. I had no asthma or hives attack for the last three years.

Concomitant medications included estradiol (IMVEXXY) taken for vulvovaginal dryness; vitamin C [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); calcium. On Monday, 22Feb2021, the patient felt draggy, but did not think it was a big deal. She just thought it was from the shot and was feeling tired. The draggy feeling lasted a few days, but she was unable to clarify outcome further. On Tuesday, she started to feel achy and felt like that too was to be expected. The achiness went away on 25Feb2021. On Wednesday, 24Feb2021, she was really busy. She was still achy but was busy. She also did not drink much water for several hours. It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills. It was a horrible feeling. She helps with her grandkids since she is retired. They were home from school and had to sit on the couch. She felt cold, yucky, and achy. It was a yucky feeling. She went home a couple of hours later. She told her husband she had to lie down on the couch because she felt horrible. She could not further describe horrible feeling. Her daughter had called her as well and was unable to describe how she felt to her daughter. She could only say she felt so sick but could not explain further. She felt awful and could not put her finger on it. She was laying down and when she got up, she felt like she would pass out. At that time, she had not eaten dinner yet. She ate dinner, took one bite and the food came back up. For a few moments she felt so faint, she felt shortness of breath, but it was only for a few seconds. After that, her and her and her husband took a drive to go to hospital. However, by the time she got to hospital she was feeling better. She was also talking to a friend at that time who said all of this was probably form the shot as well. Since she was feeling better decided not to go into the hospital and went back home. At the time she was thinking this was all from the shot and no big deal. On Wednesday night, things got crazy and worse. That evening Wednesday she was getting ready for bed and noticed her cheeks were flushed. On Thursday she got up and noticed rash. She was covered all over her body. It did not itchy really, but it was a rash. Not a bumpy rash, it reminds her of Roseola. Her joints and fingers were starting to swell. Her hands were swollen.

                                                Discussed vaccine ADE after first dose with patient. Pt reports having existing lung disease for which she uses oxygen and CPAP overnight. She reports feeling fatigued and increased SOB on exertion and increased O2 requirement for 2d after  receiving vaccine. She also reports intermittent sweating and feeling hot on her head and scalp but without chills or bodyaches for 3 weeks now. When she checked her temperature at home, she reports temps of 98 or 99. Based on discussion, her reaction is not  likely to be an allergic reaction and more likely an immune response to vaccine. Patient agrees to proceed with 2nd dose and will continue to monitor symptoms.

Then I got the chills, accompanied with a fever. My everyday temperature is 96.7 and I had a 99.7 fever.  My eyes were glassy and grey.   I was like this until the next day.  I had COVID19 on 11/18/2020 - I did not have the above symptoms of aches and pains or a fever or the chills.  My breathing and coughing finally was 99% better by February 2, 2021. My taste and smell is not back yet. Are there studies on how people react to vaccination if they had the COVID19? Is there research comparing prior COVID19 symptoms with adverseReactions symptoms?

                                                I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She received the first round of the vaccine (Pfizer/EL9269) on 2/18/21. That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

She commented that she was not in good shape when she took the vaccine to begin with. She is immunosuppressed and thinks that she should not have received the vaccination. But she also stated that she took the vaccine because she is a severe asthmatic and does not have a strong immune system so if she got COVID, she would die. Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL) for blood pressure abnormal from an unspecified start date and ongoing; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) for arrhythmia from 2014 and ongoing; rifaximin (XIFAXAN) for hepatic encephalopathy from 2014 and ongoing; lactulose (LACTULOSE)for hepatic failure, ammonia abnormal from 2014 and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for autoimmune thyroiditis from 1984 and ongoing; omeprazole (PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]) for reflux gastritis, chronic gastritis from an unspecified start date and ongoing; alprazolam (XANAX) for anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder from 2009 and ongoing; albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ranitidine (RANITIDINE) for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.The patient previously took flu vaccine vii, olysio for hepatitis c and experienced histamine level increased, lyrica and experienced weight increased.

Lab tests and procedures included cardiac output: over 50 percent, echocardiogram: her heart was good and clear, electroencephalogram with unknown results, magnetic resonance imaging with unknown results, all on unknown dates. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

                                                I am only describing this because it was so late.  I believe it was a symptom to the vaccine but it didn&#39;t occur until 9 days later.  I received the second shot on April 1.  Had only very minor hint of a head ache the next day.  Late in the evening of April 10 I felt so sore and stiff that I could barely walk.    I went to bed and woke up on the 11th with what I can only describe as a heavy weight on my chest.  If I yawned or sneezed the pain went from my chest to the top of my head.  Not a pain really.  More like a heavy thud.  I am already on oxygen so I was only a little more short of breath.  It was the heaviness on my chest that I have never experienced before that got my attention.  The way I felt was nothing I have ever experienced before.  The next day, the 125th,  I woke up and felt completely like normal again.  I am only speculating that this was a reaction to the vaccine but I have never felt that way before so I&#39;m fairly sure it must have been.  I&#39;m not sure why it would have taken 10 days after the vaccine but thought it would be good for you to know.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right leg on 15Mar2021 09:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergy, asthma, atrial fibrillation, urticaria. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) as pre treated; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as pre treated. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number: EN6200) on 20Feb2021 13:00 in left leg by injection for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced nausea, dizzy, face hot, trouble breathing/chest tightness, pain to shot, all on 15Mar2021. Clinical course: Pre treated u/ 50mg Benadryl and 1 Zyrtec. 1hr pain to shot. u/in 15 minutes of shot: Nausea, dizzy, face hot, trouble breathing/chest tightness, given oxygen &#43;2 more Benadryl laid down u/ feet up, discharged 1200HR Sx resolved by next day (24hours). The outcome of the events was recovered on 16Mar2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events nausea and vaccination site pain were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events &#34;face hot, trouble breathing/chest tightness&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                she still had a hard time with her breathing when she was doing anything that was exerting herself to get things done/ short of breath; she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up; her nose closed up completely; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 09Mar2021 at 08:30 (batch/lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient has no medical history and no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization and got sick on an unspecified date. No prior vaccination (within 4 weeks prior). No family history related to adverse events. The patient experienced she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely on 09Mar2021. She said that she wanted to let Pfizer know about the symptoms she had gone through when she got the shot. She received her first shot 09Mar2021 and it was at 08:30 am and then around mid-afternoon that same day she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely. She has a nebulizer machine and she used that and it opened up her lungs but it didn&#39;t open her nose up at all. So she sat up for a couple of nights with her nose not working right and she had to breathe out of her mouth. Days later here nose finally opened up and it was breathing good but she still had a hard time with her breathing when she was doing anything that was exerting herself to get things done. She would become short of breath. It was kind of that way when she went in for her second one, she was better at that time but she wasn&#39;t the greatest. When she had went in for second shot and told them about what she experienced after the first shot, they didn&#39;t do anything and they said that was what should be happening which was scary. They gave her the second shot even though she was very reluctant on it and she did it anyways. With that, what she experienced was even worse than what she experienced with the first shot. She got her second shot on 30Mar2021 in the morning and then the same thing pretty much happened as the first one, only it was a lot worse with her lungs and her nose. Her lungs did the same thing where they had closed and her nose did the same thing where it closed as well. She already had everything ready to use for nebulizing and that opened her lungs but it didn&#39;t open her nose for at least 3 days or maybe it took longer for her nose to open. She had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep. She was breathing through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t breathe through her nose. It was a horrible time trying to breathe. It was unreal. It was kind of scary when you&#39;re trying to breathe and you&#39;re not getting any air. She had went to her clinic and she was put on a heavier nebulizer and that that one kind of opened up her lungs and her nose and then her doctor also put her on prednisone. Besides that she was given another nebulizer that wasn&#39;t as harsh or intense for her to use for all of her reactions or if she needed it during the night. Finally she was getting back on the mend now to where at least she can breathe through her nose and her mouth. Her provider thought that she should report this because she just cant figure it out. She knows that when she gets flu shots she gets sick and the same thing happens like now. The first time she got a flu shot she was sick like that for a week and she thought that maybe it was just a fluke so she did it a second time and the same thing happened. With this shot, she didn&#39;t know if she would want to get it again or not but people say that you should so she thought to give it a chance and then it turned out the same way with the second shot. It was not good. She doesn&#39;t know if there was something in those that was not a good thing or her to have or what. She didn&#39;t end up in the hospital even though she was pretty close to going up there. Probed for names, , lot numbers and expiry dates for all previously mentioned medications such as the different nebulizers, prednisone, and the flu shots from previously and she says that they were fairly new, she doesn&#39;t have the box now because she used them and when she was done she tossed it. The products weren&#39;t old and they didn&#39;t have old expiry dates. Probed for information such as , lot number and expiry dates for previously administered flu shots and she declined to provide and said that was many years ago. Provided mailing address and then caller stated that she doesn&#39;t want to be bombarded with anything if it has nothing of importance but she doesn&#39;t want it really. She doesn&#39;t want a lot of stuff to read through if it was not of importance. Informed caller that all information was voluntary in what we ask and she does not have to provide her mailing address was if she was not comfortable doing so and she asked this agent to remove her mailing it&#39;s because she always hears stuff on the news. Caller confirmed that this was her first time speaking to someone about what she has experienced. Probed if her side effects began on the same day she received her vaccine, 09Mar2021 and 30Mar2021 and caller said that for the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 09Mar2021 the side effects started mid-afternoon and for the second dose on 30Mar2021 the side effects started a little later and it wasn&#39;t on the same day. She had started feeling it that day but she really felt them the next day. She could tell it was kind of starting to do it at a slower process but when it happened it was really worse then the first time. Caller confirmed dates of 09Mar2021 and 31Mar2021 for when her side effects began and she says she was still feeling a little bit like she did with the side effects. She still has where if she was doing a little more exertion stuff then it seems like she still was having to sometimes stop and get her breath but it was getting better now. She doesn&#39;t want to go through that again, that was horrible. Caller said it seemed like if you didn&#39;t get the COVID vaccine then you couldn&#39;t go out in public without a mask on for the rest of your life or even if you go to some places, like a concert or an event, if you didn&#39;t have the COVID vaccine then they were going to card you and if you didn&#39;t, you know what. She has a friend who went to get it because he was working and he was around people and she thought that was important too with her being around him and that was the other reason she got the COVID vaccine. She didn&#39;t really want to but she did it anyways. She probably should of just taken her chances and if she got COVID then she got it and it probably wouldn&#39;t be as bad as putting something into her system that doesn&#39;t even like her. It was hard. That was just how she was feeling. It was a bad thing, you know. Her mom couldn&#39;t (well, she has been gone since 2000) but anyways, her mom could never get flu shots either years ago. The caller doesn&#39;t know if there was something with that that she doesn&#39;t know. All she knew was that these shots don&#39;t like her. Probed for relevant test results, concomitant products and medical conditions and caller says no, she was not sick and she didn&#39;t take anything before. She wasn&#39;t sick, if she was sick she would have thought that maybe she felt like not from the sock but she didn&#39;t feel sick. She takes her temperature every day and she has been for the better part of this whole last year and she never had a fever. She couldn&#39;t take her temperature during all this because she couldn&#39;t breathe when her mouth was shut. She said that the only thing what she doesn&#39;t really understand was that if you can still get COVID after getting the shots, then why were people still doing the shots. It just makes her wonder why was everything doing something like this and it can still happen. To her it didn&#39;t really make sense. After she found out that you can still get COVID after this thing she thought well what&#39;s the point. She just thought that she would let Pfizer know about what she experienced and that this was a lot worse than when she had the flu shot with the side effects. The flu shot was minor compared to this thing, the COVID vaccines, she felt like she almost could of died. This was most definitely by far a lot worse. She would rather have the flu shot and have a minor thing than this one this was bad. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it or what caused her to have this total reaction where she couldn&#39;t breath and it was bad. She really doesn&#39;t want to do this again either. She doesn&#39;t know if there was something in this one or whatever, but it doesn&#39;t like her big time. She doesn&#39;t know if Pfizer has heard of this where people had trouble breathing after they got this done but she kind of wonders. She listens to the news and on there you don&#39;t really hear any side effects caused or how people are dealing with the symptoms. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. Vaccination facility, it was a clinic, well it was between that and the hospital that was connected to the clinic so kind of right inside the hospital area going to clinic, maybe it was the hospital. The adverse events required a visit to a physician&#39;s office because she got to the point to where she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was even having trouble walking across the parking lot so she ended up going in because she couldn&#39;t breathe. No relevant tests done. The outcome of the events &#34;she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely&#34; was recovering and unknown for the other event.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8733) via an unspecified route of administration into left arm on 30Mar2021 (at the age of 67-year-old) in the morning as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history were not reported. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccines include: INFLUENZA VACCINE on an unspecified date for immunization where she got sick for a week and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6199) into left arm on 09Mar2021 08:30 AM  (at the age of 67-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization and feeling like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely, hard time breathing when doing anything that was exerting herself, she still had a hard time with her breathing and short of breath. It was reported that patient got her second dose on 30Mar2021 in the morning and on 31Mar2021 almost the same thing pretty much happened as the first one, only it was a lot worse with her lungs and her nose. Her lungs did the same thing where they had closed and her nose did the same thing where it closed as well. She already had everything ready to use for nebulizing and that opened her lungs but it didn&#39;t open her nose. It was further reported that since 31Mar2021 she had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep and she was breathing through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t breathe through her nose. The patient went to her doctor&#39;s clinic where she was given treatment for the events reported; she was put on a heavier nebulizer; that kind of opened up her lungs and her nose and then her doctor also put her on prednisone. Outcome of events &#34;she was breathing through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t breathe through her nose&#34; and &#34;she had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep&#34; was unknown while for all other events was recovering.

                                                Patient experienced arm pain and swollen lymph nodes about 2-5 hours after shot was given. She experienced swelling of the throat that night (it was uncomfortable but did not limit breathing and no EpiPen was used). Patient also felt numbing on the feet near ankle area. Pt did have a doctor visit. These adverse effects lasted about 10 days. Pt did come back for second dose.

                                                On Thursday, 3/18, I woke up at 3:30 am extremely dizzy with everything moving around me.  Sitting up was better but upon laying down, the extreme dizziness returned.  I was still dizzy when I finally fell back asleep.  In the morning, I nearly passed out &amp; was in a cold sweat when I got up.  Gatorade helped. My PCP&#39;s office said it was probably a vaccine reaction.  I continued to feel rather light headed &amp; neck pressure &amp; by Tuesday, 3/23, I had a lot of body aches, diarrhea, I was definitely light headed &amp; felt like I could pass out.  Over the next days, my blood pressure was very unstable.  This random blood pressure issue continued  &amp; then the Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC&#39;s) began to increase in spite of the Metropolol.  They became very frequent causing light headedness &amp; neck pressure.  On 4/12, I went to the ER because my blood pressure was 185/50, heart rate 92.  Every 3rd beat was a PVC.  The cardiologist changed me to Verapamil 120 mg/day.  My condition deteriorated especially in the 3 days prior to the ablation.  I was short of breath with weak extremities.  The ablation was done on 5/25 &amp; the Cardiologist said I was having PVC&#39;s every 2 seconds.  I am currently recovering from the procedure.  Prior to the 2nd vaccine shot, my PVC&#39;s were well controlled by Metropolol to 18% from the 21% in February 2019 prior to taking Metropolol.  My blood pressure was consistently normal as well.

Since then, my physician tentatively diagnosed me with systemic exertional intolerance syndrome (myalgic encephalomypathy).

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9809 or EM9509) second dose on 18Feb2021 (vaccination age 67-year-old) on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Trigeminal neuralgia from Dec2020 (diagnosed 5 month ago after shingles vaccine), continuously being worked up by her primary for autoimmune disorders, she had a stroke in her brainstem. Concomitant medications included carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) for Trigeminal neuralgia (Has been taking for 5 months since being diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. She mentions its the only thing that calms the nerve down). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (lot number: EN5318) first dose on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 67-year-old) on forearm left deltoid for Covid-19 immunization and shingles vaccine Shingrix on 17Dec2020 (vaccination age 67-year-old) for immunization and developed a neuropathy (3-4 days later) and trigeminal neuralgia 4 days post-shingles vaccine. 10 days post second dose of Covid vaccine (28Feb2021), she developed sudden onset of chest pain and lightheadedness and profound weakness. She was driving to her son&#39;s house and got to the nearest hospital and she was worked up for a blood clot and a heart attack. Everything came up negative but she had bradycardia. So, she was put on a 20 day monitor and she had signs of tachycardia, bradycardic episodes with activity and exercise intolerance. She is still continuing with the chest pain and she ended up in the emergency room two more times, hospitalized once, and she had a angiogram. The cardiologist gave her a diagnosis of POTS and the internal medicine gave her a diagnosis of dysautonomia. She is continuously being worked up by her primary for autoimmune disorders. Finally, her primary doctor threw up her hands and said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; because she continued to have other symptoms like light headedness, and shortness of breath. Of course, it is all linked to random surges of fine hand tremors and her heart would start racing where she may just be standing at the sink. Cardiology didn&#39;t want to do anything with her because she was in normal sinus rhythm. The caller explains she was told they saw a lot of tachycardia and bradycardia but she was in normal sinus rhythm, she didn&#39;t belong with a cardiologist. Five months ago, she got the shingles vaccine and developed trigeminal neuralgia 4 days post-shingles vaccine. At that point they did an MRI of the brain, thinking maybe she had MS because that is one of the side effects of MS, but she didn&#39;t. She had a normal MRI. She has been to neurology and has had a lot of testing done. She knows the long hauler&#39;s with COVID are coming up with dysautonomia. However, she has had multiple Covid tests and is very, very safe. She does not believe that she had Covid, but she does believe this may be a reaction to both the shingles vaccine with the trigeminal neuralgia and the Covid vaccine. Before these vaccines, she was on absolutely no medications and was completely healthy. These 2 vaccines, whether it&#39;s in her genetic system or whatever, but she continues to have GI burning, belching and burning hands. They did another MRI and found she had a small vessel stroke in her brain stem. There are so many things that are happening to her right now. She is also seeing rheumatology. She just is not well. Though the CDC doesn&#39;t know about her newer symptoms, she reported to the CDC what she had at the time. They haven&#39;t gotten back to her on either of them. Five months ago was the shingles vaccine and she would have thought they would have reached back out to her because it is truly too coincidental that she takes a shingles vaccine and 3-4 days later develop a neuropathy, and the shingles vaccine is supposed to prevent neuropathy. She is so active. She walked coast to coast, and now literally just even walking up a flight of stairs, her heart rate goes up to 115 to 120. She can be at rest and her heart rate can be in the 40&#39;s. She is also having blood pressure issues as well. Her blood pressure can be 89/46 and then be 152/90, so she is just kind of an &#34;autonomic nervous system mess&#34;. Her primary care referred her to a neurologist and a rheumatologist whom she will be seeing Wednesday. She doesn&#39;t know what other specialties she may ended up seeing. The MRI was supposed to help find reasons for all these symptoms, but in fact, all it did was add another condition to her already perplexing condition. She submitted one report via CDC for the shingles vaccine on 17Dec2020, which three days later, she had trigeminal neuralgia. Her symptoms are ongoing and it&#39;s not disappearing like she had hoped. It keeps progressing and she keeps getting new symptoms. Sudden onset chest pain: Was 10 days after the vaccine, while driving to her son&#39;s house. She also developed light headedness and profound weakness. She went to the hospital (ER) and was sent home. 3 days later, she was still having significant chest pain so she went back into the ER. She was on a monitor that was showing all of these tachycardic and bradycardic episodes. She wasn&#39;t getting contacted but she was still having pain. The third time she went into the ER, she was admitted to the hospital. They transported her to cardiac care and they did an angiogram, which is when she was given the diagnosis of dysautonomia and POTS. The neurologist says that she does not have POTS because she is not presenting with consistent orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia when he does the TILT test. However, she has a lot of autonomic symptoms, so the doctor decided to do an MRI. Her previous doctor was doing all of this autoimmune testing that was coming back negative. She was tested for an adrenal tumor and had urine tests which got ruled out because she is surging, it is obvious she is having adrenal surges. The caller doesn&#39;t believe her doctor was convinced he would see anything on the MRI, so when he called her and told her she had a small vessel stroke in the pons/ medulla area, he thought maybe it could attribute to the symptoms. However, these new GI symptoms she is having does not fit. Therefore, they are continuing to do more studies like gastric emptying, a skin biopsy, CAT scan and an angiogram. She is meeting with a rheumatologist on Wednesday. She also adds she will probably do an MRI of the abdomen because she is having such a burning abdomen. She is waking up in the middle of the night with her abdomen just on fire. It seems like she is continuing to just add new symptoms. The chest pain goes away and she only gets it when she gets tachycardia or when she is taking a walk- it&#39;s not having it continuously. She had burning hand syndrome, it was burning hands in a bath, which that that lasted an hour when she was getting out of the bath and she hasn&#39;t had that since. Everything is kind of a weird conglomerate of dysfunction, like the blood pressure variations, O2 sat variations. She just wants answers. She is adjusting and adapting. But, she does wants to bring this to Pfizer&#39;s attention because maybe genetically there is something in her that even though the COVID vaccine is not a live virus, the idea is to mimic the live virus to give you immunity, and long hauler&#39;s are experiencing some of these symptoms that she is having, Not that Pfizer is going to do anything differently- she is still encouraging vaccines and she is not telling many people because she doesn&#39;t want people to use this as an excuse to not get the Covid vaccine. Caller confirms the dates of all of these events were reported to the CDC. Her doctor would have all of the dates including the dates of the angiogram, ER visits, the findings, and then the testing dates. Dates are unknown by the caller. She confirms she was in the emergency room 3 times, she was admitted and transferred to Cardiac care on the third time. She believes she was admitted for 3 days. She believes she was admitted in the evening, they did the angiogram the next day and she was discharged the following day. The MRI that was sent in 01 Dec 2020 was negative for anything. The MRI that was done last Thursday, 07 May or 09May2021 showed an infarct. So, she did have an  MRI that was clear in December and then the recent MRI showed the stroke. They are doing a CAT scan angiogram 28May2021. She explains she has no lifestyle history for developing a stroke. She wasn&#39;t even on baby aspirin or any statins. Now, they are now wanting to put her on statins. Before this, she had no history. She confirms her ER visits and one hospitalization were after the COVID vaccine and was all based on chest pain. The caller confirms the only thing that happened to her after the shingles vaccine was that she was in excruciating pain and then the doctor got an MRI going and determined she had trigeminal neuralgia. She was never hospitalized or went to the ER for the shingles vaccine. The chest pain she still gets on and off. Last night, she had it. She can get chest pain when she is walking. The chest pain is not continuous and consistent, it&#39;s more based on activity. Last night, her whole intestines were burning and she noticed &#34;oh I&#39;m feeling some chest discomfort&#34;. She is not worried about the chest pain anymore because she knows it is either a bradycardia that her chest is unhappy with or tachycardia that her heart is unhappy with and it&#39;s giving her discomfort. Her heart rate can literally go from 50 (which is bradycardic) to 120 in less than 5 -10 seconds. Her heart just goes racing like she is having a marathon, that&#39;s how fast it goes. It will last this way for a minute and  her heart rate will eventually meander it&#39;s way down so that&#39;s why she thinks she is getting chest pain. She works with elders and wanted to keep the world and community safe. She wanted to get back into the world and see her mother who is in a nursing home. Caller mentions she was taking 200mg twice a day of the Tegretol (before the COVID vaccine). She had to up her dosage because she had another outbreak so now her dose is 300mg, twice a day. She clarifies a tooth infection flared up her trigeminal neuralgia. All of the auto immune results were negative, except the MRI, which she thinks is the only thing that was positive. She is doing an autonomic test in September. At this point, her doctor has given a diagnosis of dysautonomia and she is presenting as such. Her neurologist is needing verification and so he is not giving her a diagnosis even though she has all of the symptoms of dysautonomia. Vaccination Facility Type: administered it to their elder care home. The event chest pain required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office (has weekly telephone visits because she keeps getting different symptoms. They are scratching their heads trying to figure out what other testing is needed. She is now developing little waves of hot flashes and is not having a fun time. She was living a very healthy lifestyle and was always energetic previous to this). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days. Family Medical History Relevant to AEs was No, other than her mother has hereditary angioedema. She hasn&#39;t been tested so does not even know if that is significant. She knows she has been reading about long hauler&#39;s having dysautonomia and a whole array of neurological symptoms. It is kind of intriguing as well as kind of suspicious. Everything is being managed well by her primary doctor who is very concerned and is doing everything she can to try and find and answer. The caller is very curious if there is a lot of funding, would she be put into a link and a pool to be involved in some studies or something? Is it something genetic?  There is certainly enough money out to do this work. Caller is questioning if she would get a booster given that she is questioning if she should get a booster because she doesn&#39;t know. She doesn&#39;t know if she is going to get the second shingles vaccine. She does not know what it could result in for her given these 2 complications with these 2 vaccines. Causality: Because she had the shingles vaccine and developed trigeminal neuralgia, which is a neuropathic, and then getting the Covid vaccine and having all of these symptoms, it is just too coincidental. She is going to talk to her doctor about MS since she is presenting with gut things which is more &#34;MS-ish&#34;. MS is hard to diagnose so she doesn&#39;t know, they are still testing. At this point, because all the boxes checked besides the last MRI, she is leaning towards the COVID vaccine being the cause of her symptoms. The causality for event sudden onset chest pain was related. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events bradycardia, tachycardia, chest pain and brain stem stroke cannot be excluded. The available information upon initial assessment is limited, especially as a definitive diagnosis was not available. The patient was reported to have pre-existing trigeminal neuralgia and previous brainstem stroke and is being worked up for autoimmune disorders; the role of these conditions in the development of the symptoms also cannot be ruled out. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 1/21/21 for evaluation of SOB stating her husband tested positive for COVID earlier that week and she has been around him. The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 2:30 am I awakened from sleep with difficulty breathing and a stuffy nose.  Similar to a common cold, but with the breathing issue. I contacted Dr on Demand to ask if it was ok to take medication.  This was ok and as I would normally at the onset of a cold with these symptoms I took one Mucinex and used one inhalation of BREO. After about 30 minutes I felt better and was able to sleep.  I woke up approximately 8 am and had symptoms of a common cold, no breathing issues.  I did not repeat the BREO.  However at 10PM that night I took another Mucinex for a stuffed nose.  On Feb 14 I took a Mucinex at 10 am.  as the day progressed the stuff nose lessened.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Called my PCP and left message.  Coughed an asthmatic cough Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. On Monday, Feb. 8 called PCP again. We had a virtual visit.  He said, it was not an allergic reaction.  He prescribed Prednisone and Alburetol inhaler.  On Thursday Feb . 11 I got a rash all over my body that came and went and I got Hives on the palms of my hands. Virtual visit with  my PCP. He said that he retracted his statement from Monday and evidently I was having a reaction to the Vaccine.  I kept taking the Steroid which I finished on Monday.  The rash and hives bothered me till  Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday rash and hives gone.  On Thursday morning I woke up with a burning pain across my left side of my chest to the backside and pain on my knees.  On Friday the pain was also on the backside of my waist.  It felt like shingles.  Went to see the NP at Dr. office.   They don&#39;t think I have shingles.  This is all still a reaction to the vaccine.

Then it went down to my lungs and my lungs really hurt . I do have asthma so maybe that?s a part of it? It just seems strange that I was coughing so much and gave me a headache. Then about six days later I got an attack of IBS. I haven?t had an attack  like that for two years. Maybe it?s all a coincidence? Also about 3-4 days after shot I had a herpes outbreak.

She was coherent and verbalizing the entire time.  She was observed while 911 was called.  She stated she was feeling better and her symptoms were resolving as she sat for 10 minutes.  She was taken to a different facility ER for assessment (Kaiser).  When we spoke to her later at night, she was home and said she did not receive any treatment while at the ER.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Beginning 3 days after my vaccination I began to experience chest pain and tightness sporadically throughout the day and night for the next 5 days.  No fever. Then at the end of those 5 days, it seemed my lungs, right one in particular, had pain and I developed a cough.  I had a small amount of pain when breathing, especially breathing in.  It felt very similar to an episode of Pleurisy I had quite a few years ago.  I do have seasonal allergies and had been sneezing off and on in the days previous to the vaccination and also afterward.  Symptoms have since lessened considerably and have almost disappeared.  I am curious to know if this was in any way related to the vaccination, or purely coincidental.

                                                About an hour after I received the vaccine my entire head was in pain including upper jaw and back of neck.  My face was flushed and my throat began to tighten a little  The headache and flush lasted about an hour.  (I had taken Tylenol right after getting the vaccine.)  The throat symptoms lasted longer ,lessening slightly after about an hour and a half.  Never had trouble breathing, talking, eating or drinking.  But the feeling has lasted into the late evening to a very mild degree; as if something is caught at the back of the throat, or the back of the tongue feels a little fuzzy.

ED Course: is a 68 year old female with CAD s/p PCI, HLD, OSA, seizures, HTN, asthma who presents after anaphylaxis following 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Chest tightness and original EKG concerning for STEMI, but on review EKG was artifact and did not evolve. Normal sinus the following day with resolution of symptoms. Epipen also improved symptoms which would be inconsistent with ischemia. Patient respiratory status improved on prednisone and breathing treatments. Patient is now stable for discharge.

By the end of the day, because of chest pain and dizziness my doctor sent me to the ER. I was then referred to a cardiologist, who indicated he thinks these symptoms are from the second dose of vaccine. He has seen several patients with the same symptoms after the second vaccine dose. My family doctor now thinks the same thing for the same reasons.

EMS evaluated the patient on-site. Patient was hypertensive (173/92). EMS administered 50mg Benadryl IV and 2L Oxygen via nasal canula. Given past medical history of allergic reactions, EMS transported the patient to  Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient remained hypertensive. EKG demonstrated NSR, rate 75bom, no ST-T changes, no ectopy, and normal PR &amp; QRS intervals. Blood work was unremarkable. After administration of Benadryl the patient noted improvement of their hives and was discharged with a diagnosis of allergic reaction secondary to COVID vaccine that caused acute hives.

Later that night while sleeping I woke up and could not breathe and my chest hurt.  It lasted about 15-20 minutes.  I would like to know if it is safe for me to take the second dose as I have heard from friends that it was a little bit more difficult if you had side effects.

Additionally, the patient reported that she had a severe allergic reaction this past Saturday to the Covid Vaccine, stated the nurse sent her back to the pharmacist who told her she was having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The patient reported having a hot face and neck was flushed, after the vaccine, she stated she had tingling in her tongue, lips, and face. And she stated her throat felt tight also, her lips were puffy, and a lot of heat of neck and face, thought she was starting to shake. The patient reported the pharmacist gave EpiPen in thigh and 20 mg tablet of Benadryl and called 911, and took her to the local hospital. Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets.

She has two Epi Pens from the drug store that was prescribed but she was afraid to use it, and she thought to see what happens if she uses the Benadryl. She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store.

She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

                                                Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine reaction-  First vaccination administered 3/11/2021 at 11:20 AM. Waited 15 minutes at the clinic. Only side effect was slightly sore arm.   Thursday, Apr 1, 2021 11:20 AM  Second/Booster Vaccine administered. Waited 15 minutes at the clinic as requested. No adverse reaction other than mild sting at injection site.   11:00 PM  Awakened with waves of full body, convulsive chills, heart palpitations, shallow breathing, visual disturbances. Got up to go to the bathroom and was very unsteady. Took 500 mg acetaminophen.   Friday, April 2, 5:00AM   Chills ceased and nausea set in. My shoulder was swollen, hard, hot and bright red at injection site. Inflamed spot was the diameter of a tennis ball.  I could not even drink sips of water without vomiting. Sternum aches, shallow breath.   Noon: Took 500 mg acetaminophen. it came up a few minutes later.  4:00 PM Temp 100.6  5:00 PM  vomited at least 3 times over the past several hours. Can?t keep fluids down. became concerned about dehydration. After two calls to nurse practitioner, decided it was best to go to ER for rehydration.   8:00pm released from ER after 2 liters of saline and Zophran  Saturday, April 3,   3AM Woke up with completely soaked pjs.   Stayed in bed most of the day, though got up periodically to sit in a chair. I showered, nibbled on some dry toast, sugar free jelly, and soda. Was able to tolerate, but little appetite. Still very unsteady.  Upper arm is now very inflamed from the shoulder almost to the elbow, half-way around. Hot and very tender. Sore to move it. Heart palpitations continue. By afternoon, I was able to drink more fluids and eat a few bites of a peanut butter and honey sandwich.  4:00 PM Temp 100.1  Sunday, April 4  6 AM Feeling better. Made a breakfast of scrambled eggs and tortillas, and tolerated that very well. No more nausea and feeling stronger, but still moving very slowly. If I move to fast I get dizzy.  2PM Red area on upper arm is starting to raise like hives. Sternum is still sore, likely from vomiting and dry heaves. Took a Zyrtec and 500mg of acetaminophen to counter.   5PM Arm not improved with meds taken at 2pm. Still moving slowly. Just moving from kitchen to living room is tiring.   6pm applied hydrocortisone cream to my arm to see if that would diminish the hive-like redness.   Monday, April 5 6:00 AM  Upper arm still tender and sore, but redness is somewhat diminished.

                                                About 3 days I noticed the palm of my hands were like my veins, or arteries were very green and red I could see them through the palm of my hands, it was very obvious on the palm of my hands, both hands. It was not a lot, it was going towards my thumb and my little finger.  I decided to go to the hospital the next day. I noticed the coloration would come and go several times a day.  I also felt dizzy but I was already having the dizziness before the vaccine. I don&#39;t feel it now. I also have been experiencing weight loss. Unexplained. I have lost about 10-12 lbs. I have been about that they recommended a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. My PCP did a Cat scan and they saw some granules/nodules in my right lung and they want to monitor it. They said very little, about 6 of them. In the morning I also have been experiencing shortness of breath. I am very active, I do Zumba and I do not know why I have this shortness of breath. My hands have recovered, they never came back the coloration but I am concerned about your weight loss.

                                                A few days after my shot I started feeling very tired and groggy.  My head was dizzy most of the day.  Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.  I also have head aches but they seem to have improved as the weeks have gone by, especially since I have been taking Aleve every day.  I am unable to exercise and have very little energy still.  The dizzy head continues to persist even  6 weeks out.  I had this same kind of dizzy head in August when I had Covid but it went away in a week or two.  I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.  Will it ever get better?  I can&#39;t stand to go on like this!

She has never experienced pain like this before. The R leg is also swollen from the calf down. She reports that sometimes the leg looks purple-ish and she endorses some tingling in the foot. Over the past couple weeks, she has also noted new dyspnea when walking. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations, or cough. Of note, the patient had COVID-19 in November and since then has had some upper back pain which she currently has but it feels the same as usually does for her

                                                She got the vaccine at 2:00, around 4:00 she started with fatigue with headache, dizziness, somewhat blurry vision (not extreme), chills up her full spine to her head from the bottom.  She also at that time noticed a lump on her right arm and difficulty raising her arm straight out due to severe intensity of pain.   She had difficulty of neurological function and paralysis and reaction of the right leg to just above the knee into her toes.  She had paralysis feeling and also heavy swelling that was noticed by 6:00 that day.  She also noticed that night that no position gave her comfort to be able to sleep, which kept going and she still has the paralysis, numbness, chills, fatigue.  The headaches are getting sharper, more intense in her right temple area which is very sharp, which is not normal for her.   The tumor she had gave her squeezing headache pain across her eyes and the to of her head but not the temples.   The 2nd shot brought about 3 days of wheezing, which she does  not have any lung or heart issues.  She has been having difficulty with just having normal breathing patter as she does not feel it is quite right for getting oxygen as it had been prior.     She went to her PCP last Friday, 4/16/21 who has ordered an MRI.  He has consulted with the neuro-specialist that she had with her tumor.  He will follow through with more blood work more than likely.  He did mention to her about having a COVID test to double check that end of that.  She did not have this done due to the fact that she had the brain tumor surgery and that is how they did that approach.    She was just staring to have resolution of some of her symptoms from the 1st vaccine from the right leg when she got this one.   When she got the 2nd vaccine she had intense swelling in the left leg from the knee down.   There is a definite difference in the size of the legs.   Her PCP said that there is definite damage from his testing at her recent appointment.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: CER230) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The medical history included flu and suspected COVID-19 both in Jan2020 to an unspecified date (she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID because it was such a bad flu, over a year ago), ongoing asthma from an unspecified date (mild asthma) and chest nausea in Jan2020 to an unspecified date. The patient had no history of any adverse events following prior vaccinations. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event included an uncle that had asthma, but no one else had breathing issues. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), both ongoing and taken for asthma on unspecified dates. Other products were also reported as &#34;no&#34;. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine and did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: 3N6202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and headache; on 25Mar2021 the patient experienced flu-like symptoms, fever, achy, fatigue; on 02Apr2021 the patient experienced asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest, nausea feeling in her chest; on unspecified dates in Apr2021 the patient experienced she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia. The reporter classified the events headache and flu-like symptoms as non-serious. The patient called to report that she had an asthma flare up 10 days (as reported) after her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 24Mar2021. The patient stated that she did not get a flare up often, she had mild asthma. She usually got mild flare-ups since she did not have severe asthma. She stated it could be something else, but she had not had a flare-up like this since she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID-19 because it was such a bad flu. That was over a year ago. She received her second vaccine on 24Mar2021, and the asthma flare up and hacking cough started on 02Apr2021. On the night of 24Mar2021, she started with a headache. She had the shot at 11 something and by that evening before she went to bed, she had a headache and a sore arm, but that was no big deal. Then on 25Mar2021, she started with flu like symptoms/fever. The headache persisted through that as well. At that point, she did not have tightness or the dry, hacky cough. By the middle of the day on 27Mar2021, her flu-like symptoms were gone. She would consider these to be &#34;non-serious&#34;, it was what she expected, as it was seen from the paperwork of the vaccine. By 28Mar2021, all of her symptoms were gone prior to the flare-up. She had typical flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, achy, fatigue on the 2nd, 3rd, and into the 4th day but then they cleared up. By the evening of the 4th day, she started feeling fairly normal. She stated that they were mild flu symptoms. Her temperature was only 100 for about a day. She stated that that was expected. Then, she went into this flare-up about the 10th day after the vaccine. The first 3 or 4 days after the flare up began, the flare up was worsening. Then, she got it under a little bit of control, so she was not coughing all night and having to sit up as she was sleeping. Now, she was concerned about the pain and tightness in her chest and the hacky cough. She wanted to make sure it was not going into like a viral pneumonia or another thing. She did not know. She kept increasing her Advair use and was at the top of that. She was doing the duoneb which she did not usually have to do. She had not had to do that since Jan2020 when she had the 5-week flu, or it could have been COVID (they were calling it a hoax back then). She was using her duoneb 4 times a day and now she was using it to 2-3 times, but she was still getting chest tightness, hacky cough. It was kind of like nausea- it was hard to explain, it was kind of like a chest nausea, which she had also had back in Jan2020 when she had the bad flu. She also would get this laryngitis and had trouble talking. With her flare-up, her chest tightness/nausea feeling in the chest continued. Now, she was getting into laryngitis type of thing, but she could loosen that up with her duoneb but if she got to the point where she could not do that, she would definitely have to see someone right away. She clarified that when her chest got tight, the dry, hacky cough continued/increased. When she did the breathing treatment, it loosened it up for about 3-4 hours and some of the pain would go away in her chest. If she talked too much, she would begin to cough. She had had this flare up 3 times in her life, it was not very common. She was diagnosed with asthma in her 40s, and this was her 3rd time ever having anything like this. This was the first time she had experienced a flare up like this. She had had 3 episodes since she had had asthma in her 40&#39;s and all 3 bad episodes were about the same. All the episodes were related to illness, it did not just happen out of the blue. It happened with a viral respiratory thing or the flu. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient stated that she would call her physician or the clinic &#34;today or tomorrow&#34;. She had not been to a doctor since her asthma flared up. Her respiratory doctor/pulmonologist moved away, there was no respiratory doctor nearby right now. So, her general practitioner was following her because it was a mild case and she had mild asthma. If it was severe, her doctor would make her go to a specialist. Relevant tests were reported as no. The patient used to be followed with pulmonary function tests until her respiratory doctor moved away. The patient stated that she took care of her 94 year old mother several days a week and because of all of the variances coming out, she thought it was her civic duty to prevent it from spreading through the population and creating more variances which was why she received the vaccine. She stated her doses were scheduled a month apart because they expecting to get a shipment of Moderna and they did not. They had to run to Buffalo to get the Pfizer vaccine, but they left her doses scheduled a month apart because the appointments were so hard to get. Normally, it would be 3 weeks. Her card clearly said Pfizer and they told her Pfizer, and they told her the reason for it being scheduled at 4 weeks. The patient called to inquire whether asthma flare-ups had been seen in clinical trials. It was not a reported side effect from the paperwork she received. When she looked online, she could not really find anything. She was thinking of going to a clinic but was wondering if there were any reports of flare-ups with asthma with the vaccine. With regards to causality, the patient stated it was a concern because she usually did not get a flare-up unless she was sick. She stated that there were many variables, and that it was spring, and bugs were out, but she did not usually get a flare-up like this. She stated that maybe it was a challenge to her immune system, the antibodies, but she did not know. She suspected the flare-up was related to the vaccine, but she did not have any idea. She would say yes, but she had no way of knowing. The flare-up usually only appeared if she got ill or something weird happened to her.  The clinical outcomes of the events flu-like symptoms, fever, achy and fatigue were recovered/resolved on 27Mar2021; sore arm and headache were recovered/resolved on 28Mar2021; asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were not recovered/not resolved; she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia were unknown. The reporter believed there was a reasonable possibility that the events sore arm, flu-like symptoms, asthma flare-up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were related to BNT162B2.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information the events asthma flare-ups and viral pneumonia are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, unlikely related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 14:40 (lot number: EW0150) at age of 68 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low vitamin D, lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and asthma attacks. Concomitant medications included vitamin D2 and D3 and regular vitamins for low vitamin D, had been taking that for 6-7 weeks, tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT) 2.5mcg takes 2 inhales a day in the morning and salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR) 2 puffs and a special medication because her lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and put her on an asthma medication to open her lungs. Patient got a flu shot every year and got it in Jan2021 and nothing. Patient stated that her symptoms were mild. Patient stated on day 1 after she got the shot she had nothing, that was 07Apr2021. Stated the next day (08Apr2021) she did not have injection site soreness but 2 inches below the injection site the muscle was hard and swollen and sore and remained that way for days 2, 3 and about day 4 it started to recede and day 7 it was tender. Stated it was one muscle and it was below the injection site, not at the injection site. Stated it was a lifting muscle, if she lifted her arm up it could only go so far and she would feel it and drop her arm down. Stated she got the injection in her left arm as she used it the least. Stated on days 2 (09Apr2021), 3 and 4 she had weakness with climbing stairs and with exertion, she could do it but she would notice it was more of a struggle. Stated that today she was off kilter again. Patient relayed that she looked all over online to see if she was sick with something. Stated she was tired on days 3 (10Apr2021) and 4 and that on days 5 (12Apr2021) and 6 she had tons of energy and she worked from dawn to dusk waxing floors and never has that much energy when she was normal. Stated that all of a sudden on day 5 and 6 she was perfect and then toward the evening of day 6 she thought it was her as she had to go to the Secretary of States and stand in line to renew her license and she did well and got home and started feeling tired. States she woke up last night of day 6 (13Apr2021) with a burning in her stomach and a stomach ache and it woke her and made her feel like she had food poisoning or something like that and nothing happened and she took 2 Tums and it kind of settled that down. Stated on day 7 (14Apr2021) she woke up and the stomach part was gone and all of a sudden she got really really hot, she runs about 97-97.4 and she got so hot and her face got really red like she had a high fever and she was 99.2, which is not much for most people but she feels and she took Motrin and after that she still feels a heaviness in her eyes and her temperature is 98.6 and she is normally in the 97&#39;s and was running a 2 degree fever and now maybe a 1 degree fever and she felt it in her eyes and didn&#39;t feel sick. Stated she felt fatigued like she want to take a nap but didn&#39;t feel ill. Stated whatever was going on was zapping her energy. Stated she woke up on day 4 (11Apr2021) in the middle of the night and her lungs were pinching, pinching, pinching, like an asthma attack and she couldn&#39;t stop it and she had to get her old fashioned inhaler to stop it. Stated this hadn&#39;t happened and she had been taking the special medication for 3 weeks now and it was very rare for her to get those attacks and this was worse than any. Patient relayed that today all day even with the special medication to open her lungs she can feel in her lungs that they were, she can&#39;t explain it, like they are gripping and releasing and gripping and releasing a little but. Stated she knew she was having some kind of asthma thing going on, it was not making her cough it was making her lungs hypersensitive. Stated she was expecting everything and she did read and nobody had symptoms that last more than 7 days and she was expecting them to be gone tomorrow, or she hopeed anyways. Stated the last 10 days had been easy-peasy and all of a sudden she was waking with all that coughing like something was irritating her lungs and she can&#39;t stop. Patient provided that it woke her husband up with her coughing for half an hour. States this lasted half an hour and was more than normal and something really irritated her lungs, shouldn&#39;t have happened as she is on the other thing every day and has not had an attack with that. Patient stated her provider didn&#39;t know as it was so relatively minor and was unusual but minor and she did not feel like it was life threatening. Stated her brother had Covid and she did not feel like she was trying to breathe and couldn&#39;t, or suffocating and dying. She did not feel that. The air irritated to even breathe and made her cough and couldn&#39;t stop and that was the first time she had to use an inhaler on top of on inhaler and something made her lungs respond to nothing there. Stated it may be her immune system thinking something was there, the headless thing in her lungs. Patient stated she thought she was over it and then got the fever not understanding if the fever was Covid related and she stayed at home and didn&#39;t go out until yesterday it was the 1st day out since Thursday and how could she have caught anything if she wasn&#39;t near anybody. Stated these were just thoughts in her head. Outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of asthma aggravated was assessed as possibly related based on temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for AE.

A 68-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204) at single dose on 20Mar2021 14:54 injected in left arm in the muscle for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included shortness of breath, hypothyroidism and COVID-19 back in Dec2020. She had some food allergies that were diagnosed prior to getting the vaccine. Patient was tested positive for COVID on 21Dec2020 and negative on 20Jan2021. The symptoms followed for patient was a little coughing and no smell for 3 days and a little shortness of breath.  Family medical history was none. Concomitant drug included levothyroxine 0.75 ug, once daily for hypothyroidism, which was taking for 15 years (as of 19Apr2021). No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient experienced left arm painful on 20Mar2021 about an hour or two after she got the injection, did not have much energy on 21Mar2021 08:00, foggy and not clear from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021 08:00, shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021, and hyperventilation on an unknown date in Mar2021 (reported as a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine). The shortness of breath was what she referred to as hyperventilating.  That came a week after the vaccine. The same date they took shot was when the arm pain started and the low energy was the day after. Foggy and not being clear was from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021. Shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021.  In additional to shortness of breath, she had been hyperventilating.  That began approximately a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine. Left arm was painful and it got swollen a bit and lasted for 48 hours. The husband experienced arm pain and said he almost had a fever and felt fatigued.  The reporter thinks patient (his wife) felt the same.  She had arm pain and not much energy. They came out of that ok.  About a week after the first injection, she just cannot catch her breath.  She started hyperventilating to the point where the husband thought she would expire.  She also experienced being foggy and not clear and having no energy.  First, she went to a Cardiologist and he said there was nothing wrong.   She then saw a lung doctor who send for respiratory chest and did chest CT scans and everything was clear on both test.  He did not prescribe any medications. A week after she saw him, she went to the ER on 31Mar2021for hyperventilation and shortness of breath.  They prescribed Xanax (AER 2021434900).  She said it did not work and they prescribed something else. It was 25 mg twice a day which was in a pharmacy vial.  They then prescribed Lorazepam. She was afraid to take it.  She took one instead of two. The dose was 0.25 mg twice daily.  The ER did CT scan of chest with Contrast.  It was negative for thromboembolism (also reported as CAT scan&#39;s negative for blood clots). She had shortness of breath before the vaccination and it got worse. She was managing it though.  Outcome of left arm painful, foggy and not clear, did not have much energy/having no energy/low energy was resolving. Outcome of shortness of breath and hyperventilation was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6206) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (&#34;around 10:00 or so&#34;; at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (the patient was &#34;fearful of the new variants and wanted to be extra protected against those variants.&#34;) Medical history included COVID in Dec2020 and uses oxygen (normally used oxygen, but not all the time), from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Medical history was also reported as none. Relevant family history related to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant medications (other products) were reported as none. The patient did not receive prior vaccinations, within 4 weeks prior, or on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received iodine contrast dye on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced anaphylactic shock. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration on (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced did not feel well, felt achy and nauseated (captured in AER: 2021495492). On 27Apr2021 the patient experienced had a blood clot in her lungs and she had tripped and fallen and on unspecified dates the patient experienced had headaches and felt nauseated. The course of events was reported as follows: &#34;After the second dose of the vaccine the patient felt fine, she felt pretty much okay. She attributed that to her having had COVID back in Dec2020 based on her biological knowledge. She ran this idea past a pharmacist that said that generally people might take the first dose of the COVID vaccine and be fine and then be worse on the second dose. But since she had COVID in Dec2020 her second dose of the COVID vaccine was the problem like how people&#39;s antibodies were already built up and had that reaction so that is why she was fine. She was walking out of the hospital on 27Apr2021, there were people that had crossed in front of them very quickly and her foot had hit the foot of a lady that was pushing a gurney. The patient tripped and fell down and she was taken to the emergency room. In the emergency room, a doctor did some tests and shockingly the doctor said that the patient had a blood clot in her lungs. A physician&#39;s assistant told the patient that she needed to have a computerized tomography (CT) scan done. The patient needed to go home to take care of responsibilities there, so she walked out of the hospital. She did not know if she had a blood clot in her lungs or not. Her doctor said that the blood clot in her lungs was based off of two blood values. One was the d-dimer that had a reference value of &lt; 500 and her level was 1,079 and the other blood work was troponin-I but it looked like it should be in the normal range because her level was less than 0.03 and the reference range was 0-0.04, so she would think that she would fall into the normal range. The d-dimer one was kind of scary. She had other tests done. They did a regular complete blood count (CBC) on her, another kind of test and another set of blood values but from looking at the results she was only a little low on a couple of things. They did not do the test with the contrast, but they did take an x-ray of her lung. The technician had found out that she had not had a Computed axial tomography (CAT) scan in a while, since she apparently needed them periodically, and she felt uneasy because that technician was urging her to get a CAT scan. The patient she did not know if these results were relevant or from the COVID vaccine. She did not understand this but when she was looking at the lab notice there was a note that the patient should be monitored for B Type Natriuretic Peptide (b/np) levels. It had the reference range on that one but when she read it, it looked like hers lied within the normal range. After the second dose she just had a headache but did not feel sick, but a week later they were telling her that she had a possible blood clot in her lungs. The patient was concerned at this point because she had no reason as to why she would have a possible blood clot. When she gets exhausted her oxygen drops and sometimes it will without her being exhausted. She was scared to go back to that one hospital. She was thinking about going to another hospital that was 60 miles away. If they would need to keep her overnight, she would need to make arrangements for her animals. She has had headaches, but they may be due to stress. She did not feel sick, other than she had been nauseated. The patient stated that she was not saying that what was reported on report 1 of 2 was due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why would they say that she had a blood clot too.&#34; The clinical outcomes of the events had a blood clot in her lungs, she had tripped and fallen, had headaches, and felt nauseated were all unknown.

The patient stayed in hospital for 1/2 hour for any reaction she might have because she had a chronic reaction to chemotherapy since 2015, later clarified to 2016. She left and it takes 20 minutes for her to get home and back to work, and then her arm injection site was tingling with numbing to her fingertips. she got to work and it was so busy she jumped in working, then a little while later saw she had a bruise to the top of her hand where the wrist meets the top of where her hand starts, about the size of a fifty cent piece.

Patient endorses having her first phase of vaccination early morning/afternoon yesterday. Becoming last night tachypneic and tachycardic per the husband to keep a close eye on her vital signs due to her extended complicated medical history. She began feeling short of breath yesterday evening which has persisted into the morning as well. She has been having about 12 hours of progressive now constant moderate/severe left-sided rib/left upper quadrant abdominal pain that radiates about this area and is stabbing in nature. Tachypnea because of most likely bilateral pleural effusion left more than right. Patient admitted. Bilateral pleural effusions left greater than the right.  Patient underwent thoracentesis and about 600 cc of turbid fluid was removed.  Fluid is neutrophilic exudate which is raised the possibility of acute inflammatory process.  No pneumonia seen on the CAT scan but only compressive atelectasis.  It is very concerning that patient&#39;s presentation is related to the Covid vaccination as an adverse effect. Initially she was placed on Maxipime and Flagyl but have been discontinued since.  She was empirically started on high-dose steroids for this inflammatory state and eventually switched to tapering dose of prednisone.  She will follow up with pulmonary in 2 weeks time with repeat chest x-ray.

                                                Asthmas/having asthma attacks; bronchitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information team and Pfizer sponsored program, Pfizer First Connect. A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history  included asthma. Concomitant medication includes a bunch of medications for asthma. The patient had her first dose of COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. The patient said that she does have asthma anyway and her asthma goes into bronchitis in 2021 very quickly. So she was just put on Prednisone. She is wondering if she can start Prednisone and an antibiotic for her asthma. The patient already had asthma but she is starting Prednisone and an antibiotic. And antibiotic is not something that she normally takes. The patient stated, &#34;I took the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, the first dose and I am having a bad asthma attack (in Jan2021) and I don&#39;t know what my doctor put me on, wanted me to take Prednisone and an antibiotic (Unspecified Medication). The patient ask, &#34;Can I take those after taking the vaccine?&#34; The patient was asked about treatment for the event and stated, &#34;Not until 2 days but right now I am having one. I just want to know if I can take Prednisone and antibiotic to get rid of this. Just my regular asthma medications that I am taking. My Albuterol inhaler, my Nebulizer and that&#39;s it.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

                                                The patient was referred by her primary care provider&#39;s office to receive COVID-19 vaccination. She received her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 15:07 hrs. Due to her history of allergic reactions to multiple medications (including sulfa antibiotics and ceftriaxone), she was advised to extend her monitoring period to at least 30 minutes post-injection. At around 15:50 hrs I was notified that the patient was feeling a tingling sensation in her throat, itching, and a change in her voice. She was transferred to a stretcher for acute management of suspected anaphylaxis. Airway, breathing, circulation, and mentation were assessed immediately. EMS was called immediately via 911. Her vital signs were obtained, with a BP 168/90 mm/Hg, HR 105/min, RR 24/min. She reported shortness of breath at the time. There was no stridor or wheezing on exam. She appeared in mild respiratory distress. At 15:54 hrs she was given an intramuscular EpiPen injection (0.3 mg autoinjector) in her left thigh. At 15:58 she was given an intramuscular methylprednisolone injection (125 mg) in her right thigh. Immediately after that EMS team arrived and took over her care with plans to administer diphenhydramine intramuscularly, and will transfer to ED for further management. Throughout the event the patient remained awake, alert, and fully oriented.

By the time I got home, at around 5:25 p.m., I was feeling woozy, my neck was red (flushed), I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth, I was very thirsty, and I felt that my throat was somewhat constricted.  I immediately took a Benadryl.  (I knew to do this because I had done this when I had an allergic reaction to penicillin years ago.   By about an hour later I felt alright and the redness on my neck had almost faded away.

Patient was feeling so bad with confusion and dizziness the next morning such that she was unable to get out of bed and had call in sick to work. Patient symptoms continued for the next week and she was unable to return until 19 January (but still symptomatic and short of breath on exertion). Patient was tested for COVID-19 infection on 19 January which was negative. Patient then followed up with her primary care doctor the following and retested for COVID-19 (also negative again). Primary care provider performed basic labs without revealing any abnormalities. Patient does not feel back to normal at this time - she continues to have intermittent chills and the headaches only stopped in the past 7 days.

                                                After my vaccine, I had problems breathing for about 5-10 minutes.  My symptoms were different this past two weeks.  I experienced nausea, dizziness, felt like my brain was on fire.  Last week I could not comprehend what people were saying, I did not understand.  Extreme irritation, anxiety, depression.  Fatigue and tiredness, my legs are weak.  My blood pressure went skyrocketed:  169/80.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Her heart rate was 170 and she could not breath.  She had to be rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

                                                One week after Vaccine #1 I began to have swelling &amp; itching of the face-eyes, lips and cheeks, extreme itching of both hands, massive diarrhea and some difficulty swallowing. I took oral benadryl (50 mg) and prednisone (@ 50 mg) and applied cold packs to my face and hands. I also took Allegra 180 mg LA 2x/daily for two weeks after the reaction. Vaccine dose 2 was administered on 2/17/2021 (Pfizer, Lot # EN6201) at Hospital, . One week after that (2/25/2021) I again had facial swelling and itching and massive diarrhea. I took Benadryl 25 mg and Allegra 2x/day and continue to do so.  The facial swelling/itching continued.             In addition I had, since the first vaccine, extreme fatigue, resulting in a decrease in my ability to walk (down from 3 miles to just over 1 mile) and to swim (shortness of breath, reduction in ability to swim laps). I visited my Rheumatologist on 3/2/2021 and he administered an injection of methylprednisolone to try and tamp down the continuing reaction. That seems to have made a difference.

Patient presented with known COPD and Tremors. Patient had a slight cough when she initially sat down.    After about 5-10 minutes I noted that her respatory rate had increased and coughing had continued. I checked in with the patient and asked how she was feeling initially she reported some nausea no complaints of her breathing. I told the patient that I would be getting the provider just to check things out.    Onsite Provider agreed that patient should be brought to an exam room. Patient walked on her own to Exam room 3. Upon arriving in exam room 3, provider noted hives and arm redness instructed me to deliver Epi. 0.3mg Epi via auro injector was administered at 10:27 to the left thigh area. About 1029 patients breathing did get better. Patient remained alert and conscious. 1032 patient breathing became difficult again, ordered another round of 0.3mg Epi to the right thigh. 1033 breathing was feeling better, ordered patient to use her own Ventolin inhaler to help with some of the breathing problems.    1035 ordered 0.5mg of IM Benadryl, however paramedics arrived on scene and resumed care. Clinic Benadryl was not administered. Patient was transported to ER via Ambulance to hospital for further care.

Unable to  walk daily. Since receiving the 1st vaccine I have been experiencing fatigue and it hasn&#39;t gotten any better after receiving the 2nd vaccine.  Prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine, I was very active.  I walked 5 miles daily and had an abundance of energy.  I&#39;m having a hard time walking 2 miles and my breathing is very labored when I walk.  My lungs feel like they&#39;re going to burst. I&#39;m out of breath just doing simple chores at home.  These symptoms are not getting any better and I&#39;m beginning to get a little nervous.  Let me say I was blessed not to have contracted  COVID.

                                                On 3/24, I woke up nauseous, extremely fatigued, with sore joints, headache, and abdominal pain.  A few days later I noticed I had extreme shortness of breath.  I went to see my PCP on or about 3/31.  He listened to my heart and discovered a rapid heartbeat.  He then took an EKG.  He wanted to put me on lifetime meds immediately.  I was in shock because I truly believe this is a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  I have never had arrhythmia.  In fact, I had a wellness visit with the Dr. about 3 months previously and all was good.  I have been seeing him for four years since I moved.  He does not think my new diagnosis is related to a vaccine reaction, but I find it highly suspect that 4 other women in my large circle of friends also have AFIB after 2nd shot. I spent Easter in the ER and they pumped Metoprolol in my bloodstream.  I did not stay in the hospital that night.  I went to see the Dr. on Monday morning on 4/4.  He prescribed Metroprolol 25 mg and Xarelto 20 mg IMMEDIATELY.  I picked up the meds and started this regimen.  In speaking with other women, I believe this terrible diagnosis is a direct result as a reaction from the vaccine.

A 69-year-old female patient (patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN3248, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Feb2021, 15:30 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 69 years). Medical history included blood pressure and thyroid. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, valsartan, furosemide, acetaminophen. No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Feb2021, 3 hours after the patient received the vaccination at 18:30 the patient&#39;s left leg from the knee down started to swell, got really hard and became very painful. She could hardly walk and afterwards the pain was so intense that she went to the doctor. Doctor took X-rays of her left leg on 16Feb2021, then he diagnosed her with blood clots. He gave the patient 2 heparin shots and immediately sent her to the hospital for a deep vein ultrasound on 16Feb2021. The results showed blood clot in the leg. The patient was prescribed medication and sent home. Her leg continued to be rock hard and painful. On 02Mar2021, the patient was sent for a blood panel work up. There was no improvement. On 08Mar2021, the doctor sent her for a lung CT scan. On the same evening, the patient was called to the doctor&#39;s office and was sent to ER immediately as the results showed blood clot in the lung. The patient&#39;s dose of Eliquis was doubled. This has now been going for 5 weeks, the patient had not been without pain during this time. Her left leg hardness had gone down a little but was still twice the size of her right leg, knee was huge. The swelling never goes down, not even at night. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. This case was reported as serious. The outcome of all the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

She felt fine immediately after the shot and during her 15 minute observation time.  While shopping after she began feeling dizzy and was given water, a cool towel, and sat down.  When I arrived she was breathing heavily and had trouble speaking.  Her color was good.  Her initial blood pressure was 139/80, pulse 89.  After 15 minutes of rest her blood pressure was 126/109, pulse 90.  She reported she hadn&#39;t eaten lunch so we offered her food or juice.  She chose to eat some nuts and dried cherries she purchased and reported that she felt better.  The EMS arrived, gave her a workup,  and she eventually left on her own.

She has another infusion coming up on 4/27/21 so she is really concerned about getting another dose with the side affects she is having.  She is very frail feeling and scared since she did well after taking the chemo infusion until getting the covid vax.  Now she says she feels disabled and cant do anything anymore.  She called her oncologist clinic coordinator to let them know her symptoms.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old woman with newly diagnosed pericarditis in March 2021, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with progressively worsening chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. Patient was in her usual state of health until 3/1/2021, when she developed sudden-onset pain &#34;across the entire chest&#34;.  She shares that her symptoms &#34;came out of the blue&#34;, as &#34;suddenly one day, everything just hurt&#34;.  She saw her primary care physician, who initially felt her symptoms were due to acid reflux.  As such, the patient started &#34;eating antacids and omeprazole like candy&#34;.  However, her chest pain persisted, prompting her to follow up with her primary care physician on 3/16/2021.  At that time, ECG reportedly showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute changes.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed abnormal enhancement and thickening of the pericardium with trace pericardial fluid, consistent with pericarditis.  The patient was therefore started on colchicine and an ibuprofen taper.   On 4/5/2021, Patient sent a myVM portal message to her primary care physician and cardiologist, expressing her belief that her chest pain has remained unchanged over the past month.  She continues to experience a constant burning sensation throughout her chest, aggravated by deep inspiration and alleviated by lying flat on her back.  She shares that walking up the stairs at home leaves her &#34;breathless&#34;.  Associated symptoms include subjective fevers, chills, and night sweats.  Given these symptoms, Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed findings consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion.  Patient was then advised to present to the ED for further workup as an inpatient.   At time of hospital admission, patient endorses persistent chest pain during inspiration.  Prior to 3/1/2021, she has never experienced these symptoms and reports no history of pericarditis.  The most strenuous physical activity she has undertaken in the last month include working in the garden and caring light boxes down the stairs.  She is most concerned about the fluid around her heart.  Patient reports no nausea, vomiting, palpitations, constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.  Of note, the patient developed pericarditis 10 days after her second COVID-19 vaccine.  Hospital Course        # Sub-acute pericarditis with enlarging pericardial effusion Pericarditis initially diagnosed in March 2021, thought to be potentially from her COVID-19 vaccine given time course as no other clear etiology apparent.  Pt was hemodynamically stable with an elevated jugular venous pressure at time of admission, with CXR consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion. Echo 04/05 with small circumferential pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.  Cardiac MRI on 4/7 with enlargement of moderate-sized pericardial effusion but otherwise negative exam, with no evidence of myocarditis or infiltrative myocardial process. ANA screen negative, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP not elevated Blood cultures x 2 with no growth - CRP continued to remain &gt; 160 with ibupofen and colchicine. Prednisone 20 mg PO daily was added on 4/7, with subsequent improvement in patient&#39;s symptoms.   - Discharged on regimen of prednisone 20 mg PO daily and colchicine 0.3 mg PO daily (reduced from 0.6 mg daily that she was taking prior to admission). She will also continue using ibuprofen 800 mg BID.  - Follow-up with Dr (cardiology) next week to follow-up on hospitalization and decide upon tapering plan for her medications

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number:  ER8737, expiration date: 30Jul2021, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid on 08Apr2021 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia. Patient stated she has had fibromyalgia for about 20 years. She said she had a fibromyalgia flare up with increased back pain, and had a Toradol 60mg intramuscular injection in her left hip on Tuesday, 06Apr2021. Concomitant medication included ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) for fibromyalgia from 06Apr2021. It was reported she had her first COVID-19 vaccine injection on Thursday 08Apr2021 at 10:30AM. She said that night (08Apr2021) she couldn&#39;t sleep and woke up at 3:00AM (09Apr2021) with shortness of breath, productive cough, and throat congestion. She said she had so much throat congestion, she could hardly talk. She clarified she felt like she woke up with a cold. She said she still had the productive cough, but her other symptoms went away by 8:30AM-9:00AM on 09Apr2021. She said she hadn&#39;t had a cold in 4 years. She said she read something on the internet that suggested her symptoms may be due to having the COVID-19 virus prior to getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said if she had the COVID-19 virus prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine, she was totally asymptomatic. She said she wanted to know what she should do. Patient further reported she felt her shortness of breath was medically significant because she was mouth breathing. She clarified she felt hot during that time, and took her temperature, which was 97 degrees. She said she thought the fact she was hot was medically significant because she thought she may have a bad respiratory infection or something. The patient was not brought to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office in response to the events. The patient recovered from shortness of breath, felt hot, throat congestion on 09Apr2021; recovering from productive cough, and unknown outcome for the remaining events. The events were assessed as related with bnt162b2.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 29Mar2021 at 09:20 (at the age of 69-year-old) at hospital facility as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no relevant medical history. Patient reported that she has people in the family that have had heart problems. Concomitant medication included unspecified vitamins. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9990 or EM9890) administered in the right arm on 08Mar2021 (at the age of 69-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and had a little fast heart rate but not constant, little fatigue and site pain. The patient previously took steroid injections 2 years ago (2019) and had heart palpitations before. The patient further mentioned that normally after the steroids wear off, the heart palpitations go away. The patient reported that she did not have any problems following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she had a little fatigue and site pain for just a couple of days but that everything was fine. Patient reported that she felt a little heart palpitations for maybe a day or two and then it was gone following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, she noticed the heart palpitations again and a little shortness of breath. The heart palpitations and shortness of breath were nothing that she felt that she had to run to the emergency room or anything over. The patient reported that now it was getting difficult for her to sleep sometimes at night because of the heart rate. The patient also reported that she was trying to figure out that from this length of time between her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021 and time of call on 14Apr2021, could the heart palpitations be a side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient also mentioned that when she experienced heart palpitations before, a whole work up was ordered and she was referred to cardiology and that nothing was found during the work up after previous experience with heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that she has been fine, that she has been able to work and walk and that she gets her 10,000 steps every day. After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, she was tired and didn&#39;t feel like her normal self. The patient also reported that when the time had arrived to get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, about a week before, she may have had a little fast heart rate but not constant. It was also reported that following her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, the fatigue started about the same time as it did following the first dose, on the second day post-vaccine on 30Mar2021. Patient reported that she was kind of tired and just taking a nap during the day. The fatigue was still ongoing. It was also reported that patient was starting to feel better other than the heart palpitations. The patient reported that yesterday, 13Apr2021, she felt great and could do her normal routine, other than feeling chest pains and palpitations. The heart palpitations are not constant, but are more regular during the day than she was used to. The heart palpitations were really bad last night, 13Apr2021, and that she had difficulty sleeping because of heart rate (couldn&#39;t hardly sleep at all). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for an echocardiogram. The patient&#39;s doctor did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on her on 08Apr2021 and there was nothing there (normal). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for a stress echocardiogram. The patient also mentioned that after returning from the physician&#39;s office, her husband went back and looked at the symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine information sheet. The patient reported that her husband thought that she needed to call to eliminate everything, that they are trying to figure out why the patient was experiencing the heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that 2 days ago she got on her treadmill to walk and went for 30 minutes. Patient reported that it normally takes her 5 minutes to recuperate, but that time it took her 20 minutes before she felt comfortable after her walk. The patient also reported that the site pain was nothing serious following both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The site pain began shortly after receiving the vaccine and went away after the second day following both vaccines. The shortness of breath probably started about 5 days after she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The shortness of breath wasn&#39;t enough that she felt that she needed to run to the emergency room. It just felt like when she would breathe, especially at night as she normally breathes with her mouth closed at night, the patient felt like she had to open her mouth to breathe because she can still feel the pressure in chest. The patient was still experiencing the heart palpitations. The heart palpitations are a little worse because they happen so often. Patient reported that initially, she would have a few heart palpitations and then go for hours with none. Patient reported that now, she was feeling the heart palpitations quite a bit. Patient reported that it feels kind of like a little pressure in her chest and then it&#39;ll feel like little flutters. The patient further reported that she experiences a little pressure in her chest when she experiences the heart palpitations. At times, the chest pressure would go away, but she always feels the chest pressure there now. The chest pressure has gotten worse over the past couple of weeks and that she was thinking that it would go away like the first one did. Patient reported that she went to the doctor last week and was given an EKG. Patient reported that the EKG was fine and that her physician was scheduling other tests to make sure it&#39;s nothing with her heart. The patient didn&#39;t think that the heart palpitations and shortness of breath were from the COVID-19 vaccine, but that her husband looked at the vaccine information paper after her doctor&#39;s appointment and said she should call Pfizer. The patient had not yet recovered from heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pressure while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

She couldn&#39;t talk; seemed completely out of it; swollen lymph nodes/enlarged lymph node in her right lung/swollen lymph nodes on her right breast; mass in her throat; panic attack; experiencing some difficulty breathing; anxiety; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is the patient&#39;s husband) received via medical information team and from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 69-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EP7533, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 12:00 (at the age of 69-years-old) at 2nd dose, single in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease from an unspecified date (had it for years), basal cell cancer, and the patient&#39;s immune system was compromised. It was reported that the patient&#39;s father had lymphoma and passed away due to kidney cancer. The patient&#39;s mother died at the age of 97-years-old, and was healthy. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: ER8727) received on 21Mar2021 15:00 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that the patient experienced swelling on left arm where the injection was and little bit of swelling in the lymph nodes in armpit. The patient&#39;s height was 163cm, and weight was 68.01kg; both on unspecified dates. He patient&#39;s husband reported that something was happening with his wife (patient), and he cannot find the patient&#39;s symptoms on the website. It was reported that the patient had the second shot of Pfizer vaccine 3 weeks ago, this past Sunday. The second shot was given in the patient&#39;s right arm, and the first shot was given in the left arm. Everything was normal for close to three weeks. Then on Sunday, on 24Apr2021, the patient lost her voice all of a sudden. She couldn&#39;t talk, seemed to be completely out of it, and the patient&#39;s husband thought that she was having a stroke. They went to the ER (emergency room). The doctor though that the problem was that the scented detergent the patient used for her mask. The doctor thought that it caused a severe case of laryngitis. The patient was sent home. The patient&#39;s voice was still weird last week. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right arm, and breast were swelling. On 2021, the patient experienced some difficulty breathing and anxiety. Two days ago, on 02May2021, the patient noticed that her right breast on the same side as the second shot was enlarged, heavy, and firm. The patient has no history of breast cancer. A couple of days prior (in 2021), the patient&#39;s arm was swollen. It was her whole arm. The patient was scheduled to see her dermatologist at 11:30 this morning since she was having a basal cell cancer removed from her face. The patient was all upset and hyper and was having trouble breathing a little bit. The patient&#39;s husband thought that it was stress. The patient was scheduled for surgery on her face on Wednesday this week and the patient had a panic attack on an unspecified date in 2021 so the patient was brought to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s husband stated that this was because the patient was scheduled for a surgery for basal cell cancer removal, and that the patient&#39;s breast being so large, the patient was worried. The patient had Hashimoto&#39;s disease for years, and her immune system was compromised. The extra swelling could be because her immune system was working overtime. The patient&#39;s voice was good for a while, but today, she was losing it again. The patient uses different laundry detergent now. The patient&#39;s husband stated that these never happened before, and that it could be coincidental. The patient had no reactions prior to the 3-week period after the shot. The patient was wheezing now, and the patient&#39;s husband may need to call an ambulance. The patient&#39;s husband further stated that he took the patient to the hospital (emergency room) this morning because the patient was wheezing and sounded horrible. The hospital record stated that the patient had an enlarged lymph node in her right lung and that her right breast was swollen and infected. The patient was currently in the emergency room and was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was going to have a biopsy today. After the patient&#39;s first dose, she had a little swelling on her left arm where the injection was and a little bit of swelling in the lymph nodes in her armpit. The patient&#39;s husband noticed that the patient&#39;s right arm where the second injection site was, not just the site but her whole right arm swelled, from shoulder to wrist. The patient&#39;s husband also noticed that the patient&#39;s right breast was huge. On 05May2021, the patient had MRI and CAT scans which showed &#34;extensive mediastinal mass effect continuous from right to left side with greatest dimension of 10cm. Mid left pillar idiopathy and subcarinal area neoplastic disease&#34;. She was having a biopsy done today at the hospital&#34;. The patient&#39;s lymph nodes were swollen in the area between her lungs. On 05May2021, the patient had her COVID test which showed negative result. It was then reported that the biopsy was going to be either Ebus (as reported), which is where a tube was put down the throat, and if that did not work, there would be a mediastinoscopy performed and after that, there is a possibility that CAT scan will be done. The patient&#39;s husband reported that on Apr2021, the patient&#39;s right breast was diagnosed with cellulitis so the patient received a couple of IV (intravenous antibiotics) for the breast and it slightly improved. The patient&#39;s cellulitis could lead to sepsis that&#39;s why she was treated with IV antibiotics. The patient&#39;s MRI on an unspecified date showed that the patient&#39;s breast was clear of any swollen lymph nodes and potential cancer. The patient was also given IV antibiotics for breast enlargement, breast swelling, and breast infection. On Apr2021, the patient experienced side effects mass in her throat, swollen lymph nodes on her right breast, and cellulitis. The patient will be undergoing a biopsy today, because they think that patient has lymphoma. It was reported that the patient received her vaccination at a huge vaccination setup at a local high school. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days (unspecified dates) due to the events breast enlargement, swelling arm, breast swelling, breast cellulitis, and breast infection. The patient&#39;s husband also stated that the patient was brought to the emergency room for because the right arm started swelling and that the right breast was huge, then was taken to the hospital room that night. No other vaccine received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events  breast cellulitis, and loss of voice was recovering, for events swelling arm and panic attack was recovered on an unspecified date, and for other events was unknown.

It hurt just a little bit, no big deal. It hurt and was red around it.; the doctor said it was Covid Arm. It hurt just a little bit, no big deal. It hurt and was red around it.; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 69 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Apr2021 in the afternoon, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine was administered on the same day. Family medical history relevant to AEs: none. Medical history included brain surgery on 27Apr2020, heart thing, allergic to latex and metals and she was overweight. She has never had a reaction to medications. She gained 40 pounds. She was at 260, and now she was 250 because she lost 10 of that. She had for 30 or 40 years (no further details provided). Concomitant medications were none. The patient got the shot and after that they did not hold her, she just left. She did not feel the injection at all, she was wondering at first if he actually gave it to her because he was very good. She went to the grocery store. She had brain surgery last year, so she was weak anyways. After having brain surgery she could shop for, like she built up to an hour, really and had no problems. She stopped for breakfast and she was fine. She got in the store and just started walking through the store. She had trouble breathing (maybe around 45 minutes to an hour after vaccination) and was leaning on the cart because she was so weird. It went away maybe the next day or the day after. She got about three things and then went to the line and got out of the store. She went home and did not remember when the spot showed up, maybe hours after before she noticed it. It was a raised spot like a bug bite on top of her left (no further details provided). She thought a spider must have bit her. Then, she went to bed and the next day she had hives all over her which were practically on top of each other. It was really bad hives and only from the knees up for some reason, none on her toes or her feet just her knees up and it was horrible. She was tired, weak, and felt ill so she stayed in bed a lot on 28Apr2021. She slept for practically the whole time the next 4 days. She went to the doctor the day after for the hives and he said it was Covid Arm. She was not sure if she was allergic to the shot itself or like a bad reaction happened here. She went in and had them check, and he searched on the internet. That was why she will not be going back to that doctor. It hurt just a little bit, no big deal. It hurt and was red around it. It was more like Covid body. She had headache on 28Apr2021 and then chills on 29Apr2021 and it was like she had the flu only she did not throw up. Chills were intermittent and on and off all day whether she was in bed or up or under a lot of covers or not. On 02May2021 she got nauseated (intermittently, a lot of nausea). She took a lot of Benadryl. She was sleeping good because she took Benadryl. She still had headaches and she woke up with it. It was kind of dull for four days. It probably came on she was going to say almost instantly but she could have been stressed about getting the shot. At the time of report it was worse than it was. She also had swelling on her face and lips on 02May2021 but she also had hives in the same spots that it was swelling. Right at the top of her forehead, and the top of her lip but she thought it may have been a hive because she had a hive on her lip and three or four on her forehead. She thought it was more than that and there was swelling because she was allergic.  Her throat did not close up. She had legs swollen on an unknown date in May2021. She did not think this had anything to do with the shot. She did not think it was from an allergic reaction on that part. She thought she was probably allergic to it because she had so many hives. She was scared to death of getting the second one. She was feeling really good when she walked in, she was walking good and everything, and she went out to eat and the store. It was quite long but truthfully when she got out of bed, she would just go to her couch. As of last night, the trouble breathing was there but she had not been up long enough to see. She was going to therapy later. She was very vivid because she was doing so much better because of the operation. She was still feeling weak but sometimes it got better and then she got weak again. Her body was compromised and everything because of her operation.  She wanted to get the shot because she did not go out many places.  Hives all over her started as a few, so she went to the doctor because it was quite a few. The next day, they were so much worse. The patient stated she sounded like she was hypochondriac. Benadryl was all she took for treatment and took it as often as the box allowed, she thought 2 every 4 to 6 hours. The events did not require ER visit. Relevant tests: none. Chills lasted about five days off and then went away on 03May2021. Hives resolved on 05May2021. Swelling in the face and lips resolved on an unspecified date in May2021. Headache and legs swollen had not yet resolved. The other events outcome was unknown. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The fatigue, trouble catching my breath, GI problems and bodyaches lasted a full week. I haven?t seen my doctor because I have taken medicines at home that are over the counter. However, this kind of reaction has not been reported so I thought I should tell somebody. I?m going to be fine, but it was a surprise. I can breathe better today, so I will not seek medical attention.

It felt almost like a seizure because my lack of control was evident in my movements.  With my heaviest PJs on, it took 8 blankets to finally warm me up.  I am on a CPAP machine but I was having a hard time getting my breath.  I was also nauseous but never threw up.  I finally got back asleep a little after 3 am but  woke several times after that.  This morning, I had a terrible headache and can&#39;t get rid of it. Although I feel better than last night, I feel lousy.  It is now 2 pm and I just want this to be over.  On the first shot, I didn&#39;t have any reaction at all.

                                                Patient was alert and conversational throughout first COVID-19 Pfizer vaccination. During post vaccination waiting period, patient became unresponsive and exhibited convulsion like movements in her waiting chair. Pharmacist quickly evaluated patient and patient was only minimally responsive to painful stimuli only. Breathing was rapid, shallow, and irregular with an expiratory wheeze heard upon auscultation. Patient was slouched in chair but supporting self and had a strong grip with her left hand. Skin condition was warm but diaphoretic. Ambulance 911 service was called. No swelling of the throat, mouth, face, nor lips was seen. Patient continued to be non-responsive, with non-comprehensible sounds, and was not opening eyes or following commands. Due to worsening ability to breath and wheezing on expiration, epinephrine 0.3 mg was administered intramuscularly into the left thigh at 1230 on 2/25/2021. Approximately 5 minutes after epinephrine administration, the patient?s work of breathing improved, wheezing was diminished upon expiration, and respiratory rate had slowed to 16 breaths per minutes. BP was 160s/80s and HR 98 (after epinephrine administration). Patient began opening eyes spontaneously but was still not following commands. Ambulance service then arrived, report was given, and patient was transported to Hospital Emergency Department.   Patient was under the care of Doctor at the emergency department and received albuterol/ipratropium nebulization, dexamethasone 10 mg Iv, famotidine 20 mg IV, and magnesium sulfate 2 g IV. After the physician evaluated the patient and talked with family, the patient?s family stated that the patient has a history of anxiety related reactions such as this with convulsion like activity. Doctor then determined that the patient did not have an anaphylactic/allergic reaction and instead had a anxiety related vasovagal type reaction. Doctor stated that the patient could receive the second COVID-19 vaccine dose in 3 weeks without issue. Patient then discharged from Emergency Department (unsure if AMA). Patient then presented to the pharmacy with her daughter after discharge to fill in staff on the outcome of the reaction. Patient appeared to be at baseline mentally and physically. Pharmacist contacted Emergency Department to discuss case with patient?s nurse to obtain information about medications received in the emergency department. Patient daughter stated that she would like to be present for second dose of vaccine to help avoid a similar anxiety related reaction from occurring.

                                                EMT noticed client, (DOB 7/1/1950), was sitting in post-vaccine waiting area with flushed face within 15 min of receiving the COVID vaccine (Pfizer, lot #EN6202, expiration date 6/30/2021, dose 1). EMT approached client, asked how she was feeling, client reported feeling fine. At 1337 EMT took oxygen saturation 98% and pulse 96. EMT informed PHN of client&#39;s condition and possible language barrier. EMT stayed with client as PHN called over client&#39;s family member who was waiting outside. Family member used FaceTime to call client&#39;s daughter for help with translation.   Per client&#39;s daughter, client suffers from anxiety, asthma, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. EMT took vital signs: blood pressure 140/Palpated, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 97%, pulse 96.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

                                                Seven or so hours after injection on Saturday, I developed a rash that quickly became hives on my lower back, which spread to my inner thighs.  Took Benadryl OTC tablets, and used Benadryl topical gel on affected areas.  Overnight, the rash spread to my outer thighs.  By about 9am the next day, (Sunday) developed a headache which became more severe as the day wore on, a fever (102), and, body aches.  Talked with my primary care manager on Sunday afternoon who advised me to continued with my benadryl treatment, but to go to the ER if I developed any breathing problems.  This all persisted in varying stages of severity through Tuesday, when I started having breathing issues, and went to the ER, where I was given steroids and a breathing treatment, chest xray, blood tests, etc.  Was also given a prescription for five days of prednizone, and, released.

Four hours after injection, the wheezing worsened, the inside of my mouth started itching, and I had abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. These symptoms lessened the next day but continued for one week.   I did not report these reactions immediately, as I did not want them to prevent my receiving the second covid vaccine dose. Also, if the second covid vaccine dose started to cause the same type of reaction, I was prepared to use two Epi Pens and call 9-1-1. Fortunately, the second dose caused only a sore arm.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number EN6205) via unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not provided. Upon 15 minutes after injection, she noted nausea with belching and had some SOB. Symptoms worsened as she ambulated over to the medical bay along with her chest pressure. She denied rash, hives, welts, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Patient reported recently admitted for unstable angina and CAD with tachycardia. Patient had elevated d-dimer and blood clot was ruled out. Patient discontinued on new medication, beta blocker. Since discharge this Sunday 21Feb2021, she reported chest heaviness as if she has &#34;cardboard on chest.&#34; Can slightly increase with going up and down stairs or increased activity. She states she had reached out to her cardiologist via an online site but has not heard back. Patient stated her pain is about the same today. Patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath. The outcome of events was unknown.   No Follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events unstable angina and tachycardia cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s age and suspected cardiac condition are risk factors. The event CAD, given its progressive nature, is most likely an underlying condition, thus unrelated to the suspect drug.

After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 10Feb2021, 12:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s Hypothyroidism from 2000 (had it at least five years before a diagnosis), allergies year-round, depression, pneumonia, wheezing, calcium deficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) taken for Hashimoto&#39;s Hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date and ongoing; bupropion hcl (BUPROPION HCL) taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing; loratadine (LORATADINE) taken for allergies year round from an unspecified start date and ongoing; aspartate calcium, aspartate zinc, calcium ascorbate, glucosamine sulfate, magnesium aspartate, manganese aspartate (BONE STRENGTH) taken for calcium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; carbinoxamine maleate (OMEGA 100), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3), chondroitin sulfate, collagen, glucosamine (COLAGEN) taken for an unspecified indications from an unspecified start dates and ongoing. When she was older the patient was given the high dose Flu Vaccine and had this reaction where her arm was red from shoulder down to elbow. After that she told them not to give her the high dose Flu Vaccine. She gets the regular Flu Vaccine. She assumes it occurred year turned 65, but was not sure. She does not have a lot/exp/NDC to provide. The patient experienced arm started hurting and very tired (around 7:00-7:30), very thirsty (had to drink three tall glasses of water back to back, reported she was never that thirsty), one of legs got weak (for a brief moment one of her legs was very weak and noticed while walking from the living room to the bed room) and achy on 10Feb2021. It was reported that the patient took a bath with Epsom Salt and it id not help. She got in bed by 8PM. Normally she goes to bed around 9:30-10 PM, but she was very tired. She then followed up and stated she went to sleep after the news about 10:20.  Then at 4:45 AM she woke up  because her eyes were very dry. Stated she has a humidifier in the apartment and usually has no trouble with her eyes, but they were very dry. She also noticed her ribs were hurting and it was noticeable on 11Feb2021. She was also more achy, but it the ribs hurting did not last real long. Then she noticed she was wheezing (11Feb2021). She knows she was wheezing because she has had pneumonia in the past and had wheezing then. The wheezing she had after the vaccine was not real bad. It stopped after about 10-15 minutes or so. She had laid down in bed for a while then got up around 5:30 AM. She felt better around then, but it took until like around 8AM before she felt fully okay as her arm was still aching. The outcome of the event arm started hurting and achy  was recovered on 12Feb2021; eyes dry, ribs hurting and wheezing recovered on 11Feb2021; thirst and muscular weakness recovered on 10Feb2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

At the same time I felt a rush of heat through my body and I became short of breath. But I experience shortness of breath quite often with my asthma so this is not unusual. But the tinnitus has not gone away after over two weeks ofter receiving the shot. I am worried it will get worse if I have a second shot.

                                                Shortness of breath, severe chest tightness started 5 to 8 minutes after the injection  lasted for 5 minutes  and were followed by an overwhelming  weakness, confusion, later also by abdominal cramps, some urinary urgency- all gradually improved over 30-40 minutes.  I felt later agitated, had dry mouth, headache- improved after drinking 8-10 cups of water.  I did not seek help. I stayed in the  shot area in a large tent.

                                                By Day 2 I noticed new tinnitus sounds, louder and hauntingly disturbing. Roaring in ears different than before and scary. My blood pressure dropped when I stood up and although I did not faint, I had difficulty standing up and moving about. My chest burned and I coughed a lot, shortness of breath worse than usual, and my O2sat went down to 94 when it usually was no lower than 96. These mild but disturbing symptoms persisted, and then on Day 6 I had a sudden onset of dizziness and cognitive dysfunction that made me a &#34;bobble head&#34; that put me to bed for 3 days. I had a headache and chest pains and dizziness that wanted to become vertigo if I moved my head. I am afraid to get the 2nd dose because I&#39;m concerned that these symptoms will be triggered again and become permanent.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

This lasted about 5 minutes till she could finally clear her throat.  She called it a Covid Cough.  She said this disappeared after 20 minutes.  She said it was the strangest thing and it hasnt happened again since then.  Three weeks later she was exposed to COVID since having both vaccines and is doing well.  She said the CDC could contact her for a vaccine study purposes if necessary.

She had heart issues in the past. At 10:30, it was also a little bit difficult to breathe. It lasted about 15 minutes or so.

I talked to the pulmonologist who sent me to the. Later, the symptoms did not improve, I called my PCP who recommended me to go to the ER, several tests found nothing. I followed up with a cardiologist and later with pulmonologist who prescribed Symbicort inhaler and it has helped tremendously.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose.

Treatment team Sepsis  Principal problem Discharge Summary    Inpatient Discharge Summary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admitting Provider:  Discharge Provider:     Admission Date: 3/26/2021     Discharge Date: 4/5/2021   Discharge Diagnosis Severe sepsis COVID-19 pneumonia Acute hypoxic respiratory failure Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with RVR   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission patient is an 70 y.o. female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation chronically anticoagulated with Xarelto, S/P ablation x3 at the Medical Center, and sinus bradycardia who presented to the ED for evaluation of general malaise, shortness of breath, loss of taste and smell, coughing, and shortness of breath and was found to have sepsis due to COVID-19 pneumonia in the ED.   Patient states that over the past week she has been extremely weak, with nausea, diarrhea, but denies vomiting. She also reports that her appetite has decreased and noted that the symptoms has worsened and as a result she presented to the ED for further evaluation.Patient denies abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or chest pain.   Upon further evaluation and tests in the ED, she was noted to have severe sepsis as indicated by vital signs and chest x-ray imaging indicating groundglass pneumonia typical of COVID-19 infection. She also had COVID-19 swab which returned  positive result. Additionally, patient was noted to be hypoxia with SPO2 of 88% requiring oxygen supplementation.    Hospital Course patient was admitted to a Hospital due to shortness of breath, with fatigue and weakness, and was found to have severe sepsis with endorgan damage of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.  Imaging study showed no evidence of PE, but did show evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.   Pulmonary was consulted, she was started on remdesivir with Decadron.  She had an increase in oxygen requirement to the maximum of 10 L via specialty nasal cannula during the admission.  With the treatment of remdesivir and Decadron she had improvement in her hypoxia, and was ultimately weaned to room air by the time of discharge.   She underwent a desaturation study on the day of discharge and determined that she did not need any supplemental oxygen.  She completed her entire steroid and remdesivir course during the admission.  She had no evidence of superimposed bacterial pneumonia.   Her hospitalization was complicated by atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, that improved with metoprolol administration.  This was thought to be precipitated by her severe hypoxia with acute illness.  She was kept on metoprolol 25 mg twice daily on discharge, and will need to follow-up with her cardiologist at  Medical Center to determine if she can come off of this again.  She will continue to take her Xarelto as previously prescribed.   She was medically stable for discharge on 4/5 in stable condition, and will need to follow-up with PCP within 7 days, with cardiology within 2 weeks at the hospital, and pulmonary within 2 weeks as well.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 01Apr2021 15:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing arthritis, ongoing depression, ongoing anxiety, ongoing tardive dyskinesia, ongoing balance disorder for maybe 3 or 4 years. When probing medical history and concomitant medications, she reports she has arthritis, depression, anxiety. She reports she takes a few psychiatric drugs but declines to add those to the report. She reports she has Tardive Dyskinesia and gets Botox injections in her temples and jawlines every 3 months. Her last Botox injection was one month ago. Concomitant medication included botulinum toxin type a (BOTOX) taken for tardive dyskinesia, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received first dose of Covid 19 vaccine (Lot number: EN6205, Expiry Date: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 12:30PM administered in right arm for Covid-19 immunization. For any Tetanus vaccine or Flu vaccine that may have caused her a sore arm in the past. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No other vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The patient received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 01Apr2021. She had fever, body ache and chills one day post vaccination (02Apr2021). The symptoms lasted until 03Apr2021. She didn&#39;t have any other symptoms until 2 weeks later. She started having an arthritis pain in her hips, knees, shoulder, and toes. The pain is quite significant. She wants to know if this is was part of an immune response to the vaccine. The worst pain she is having is on the right side. Its the same side in which she received the vaccine. Caller states she was under the care of a doctor for pain management. She was going to start getting injection maybe cortisone. She felt everything flared up. She went to the emergency room and received 2 shots of morphine. She cant even bend over she feel like going to the E.R and getting another shot of morphine to help ease the pain. A couple weeks ago, she noticed she was having some arthritis pain. She had been told in the past that she has arthritis. She had arthritis pain in her hip, knees, shoulder, and toes. She went to the emergency department and had a CAT scan and saw she had a herniated disc in her back. The emergency room thinks the herniated disc in her back was causing her back pain. All of her joints hurt. Her hip hurts so bad she can hardly take a breath. She was asking is this an arthritis flare up or an immune response from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was asking if this was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She&#39;s going to have steroid injections in her foot. She has arthritis in her big toe and she has bunions. Last week she had cellulitis in her right foot and she could hardly walk. From her neck down she hurts. She took some muscle relaxers and she&#39;s having trouble talking because of the medicine. She takes Tizanidine and Hydrocodone. She took some and her back feels better but her hip is horrible. Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 7.5mg-325mg. Take one tablet twice a day as needed. In a pharmacy bottle, NDC/Lot/Expiry not known. Tizanidine 4mg. Take one to two tablets two times daily as needed. In a pharmacy bottle, NDC/Lot/Expiry not known. Discard by date on pharmacy bottle is Apr 2022. She went for a follow up with her primary care provider after she went to the emergency room and her primary care doctor told her she can&#39;t do anything for her. The doctor didn&#39;t even ask her a question. That&#39;s not the first time the doctor has done that. She&#39;s looking for a new doctor. She reports two weeks ago she was able to hold her granddaughters for the first time in 14 months since the pandemic started. She reported her initial side effects of fever, body aches and chills lasted about a day then the day after on 03Apr2021, those side effects were gone. Except for a sore arm. She had a sore arm for 2 to 3 days. Her arm felt like getting a flu shot. But the next day it felt more like getting a tetanus shot. The arthritis pain has been gradual. First she noticed her thumbs would be sore and her thumbs have been fine for quite a while. Meaning, she hasn&#39;t had arthritic pain in her thumbs for a while. She woke up this morning and everything hurts. It&#39;s gotten worse. She also has pain that goes down her leg. This pain is associated with the herniated disc but she can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called. While in the emergency department she had a CAT scan and routine blood work done. She had an MRI scan last Saturday, 01May2021. She doesn&#39;t know the results of that yet. Her pain management doctor thought she had a herniate disc. She has back pain and was told a while ago that she does have arthritis. If she aches, it&#39;s the arthritis. A week or so before she went to the emergency department she fell twice and landed on her bottom both times. She didn&#39;t have to go to the emergency department for either of her falls. She just had some bruises. She reports she&#39;s had balance problems for maybe 3 or 4 years. She reports she went to the emergency room only once and it was about 3 weeks ago. She would like to add that the worst pain she&#39;s having is on the right side of her body. Relevant Tests included blood work, CAT scan and MRI. The outcome of event Fever, body aches, chills were recovered on 03Apr2021, of arthritis, herniated disc in her back, back pain, hardly take a breath, was not recovered, of other events was unknown. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

She has been safe at home during the pandemic tested a few times for COVID-19, consistently negative.   Approximately 1 month after the second Pfizer vaccine she developed a precipitous onset of severe acute congestive heart failure subsequently diagnosed nonischemic cardiomyopathy/myocarditis. Initially, prior to the diagnosis at the onset of the illness she was treated with 1 week course of high-dose prednisone as if this were asthma because of the primary symptom of shortness of breath.  This was of no benefit. Over the ensuing 2 months she has been seen by primary cardio

A 70-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 26Feb2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Spondylitis, Spondylitis in neck, Inflammation and Arthritis. The caller states that she fell on her knee and got a big bump and with further inquiry, this was prior to the vaccine. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) included her father had similar kinds of inflammatory problems, bones, muscle tissue growth. In Jul2020 (at age of 69 years old), patient received shingles vaccine, she wondered if it was still in her system, patient felt awful and more inflammation. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. History of all previous immunization with no Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks), no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s). No other products. She provided only the birth year, 1951, and said within the first six months. She stated that her weight can fluctuate from 120 pounds to a pound up or a pound or three down. Patient had a runny nose since about a week after the first dose of the vaccine (05Mar2021). She was reluctant to get the second dose because she continued to have a runny nose, almost every day, all day long, sometimes it&#39;s worse, sometimes it&#39;s better. Her friend was visiting and said that he too has had a runny nose, and he thought it was from wearing a mask, but she didn&#39;t wear a mask, but she didn&#39;t wear a mask, well she only wear them when she goes out and she&#39;s not out that much. When asking for clarification the caller states that the runny nose has been happening for weeks. The runny nose comes and goes. Sometimes she thinks it&#39;s getting better and then it got worse again. It&#39;s not like a side cold, she always has a little sniffle. It hadn&#39;t been bothering her the last couple hours and now it&#39;s started to well up and she&#39;s thinking what is this about. It started about a week after the first shot and definitely after the second shot. The runny nose was sometimes accompanied with ear ache and sore throat both of which continue to come and go. She didn&#39;t know when the ear ache and sore throat started. They come and go quickly, and had happened maybe half a dozen times or more. Her husband would say it&#39;s just a cold and maybe it was. She had been treating the symptoms with Elderberry and Zinc lozenges. The caller remarks that she gets a lot of inflammation, described as arthritic inflammation and this inflammation was worsened after the first vaccine on 26Feb2021. She states that this response happened about 4-5 hours later. She also complained of headache, and other symptoms and when asked to repeat the other symptoms she clarified as inflammation in whole body. The caller also reported that something new happened, she had fibrin buildup in her hands on 26Feb2021, she watched it grow on her hands, it was like a science fiction movie; that was still there. She&#39;s had fibrin before but never watched it happen. The buildup was itchy and she describes it as an inflammatory response. The fibrin buildup began that night after first dose of the vaccine on 26Feb2021. This started Friday night. The fibrin and inflammation are still there, the only way it will go away was to have it cut out. That was how her body reacts. The caller did report that she had some breathing issues after the first vaccine and was told that it wasn&#39;t anaphylaxis, it was probably swelling of the throat, but it didn&#39;t last. After the first vaccine she also had SVT in her heart, that night when she was having the inflammation, she remarks that she could feel her heart doing somersaults. The SVT began on the evening of the first vaccine (26Feb2021) and into the next day and into Sunday late afternoon. That was weird, she thought she was doing to die, she was not able to breathe, she was miserable, she thought to sleep it off, she was trying to get away from the headache, it was her whole head. All events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. At the time of this report, the outcome of Runny nose was not recovered, of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021569236 same patient, different drug dose/event.

                                                The left side of my throat started swelling around 2:30 pm,  on Friday, ?June 4, although my breathing and swallowing were not impacted.  I put a piece of hard candy in my mouth, hoping this would clear up.  The area beneath my tongue on the left side began to be painful about 10 minutes later.  This was evident whenever I swallowed or moved my tongue, such as in swallowing and speaking.  (Note: these continued until 1:30 am;  I tried to stay awake until it all dissipated but I felt drained and exhausted.)  After 35 minutes I left the ?recovery? area, reported my symptoms and took a bottle of water.   In my car I used my inhalant, finished my water and waited another ten minutes.  The coolish water helped the swelling feel better.  Once home I hydrated a lot with water, and found the cool water eased symptoms only if temporarily.   As the night progressed the symptoms eased a little.  When I awoke  the next morning, Saturday, June 5, the swelling had gone down a lot and the under-tongue pain was much lighter.   My arm, though, was achy when I moved my arm around but I did not feel the need to take pain relief medication.  I continued to use and move my arm and the pain decreased.  By the end of the night there was little discomfort, but the injection site muscles started to harden.     Ar3 these all normal currencies?

Blood pressure top number was 175, ten minutes later it dropped to 155. Staff member stated my pulse was elevated. Although, I only felt the slight tightness in my throat. My oxygen level stayed at 98. They had me stay for an hour and then I went home. By then the tightness started to lessen. After an hour or two the feeling was total gone. My blood pressure had gone back to normal when I checked it at home. The next day at 2 pm [13 hours later] I had a temperature of 99.1, had the chills yet felt warm, started a slight headache and became very tired. At 2 am in the morning everything was over. I woke at my normal time and felt great. Have been doing well ever since.

                                                I walk 3 miles everyday. I went out for my walk around 4 pm  and after walking about 10 minutes I realized I was short of breath this increased the longer I continued to walk. I have never had it happen before and I believe it is a side effect of the vaccine. I walked the next day and though I was still short of breath it was not as severe.

This was followed by red flushing to the skin on the face and left neck, shoulder &amp; hip pain.  BP initially was 182/98 which is elevated for me.  Felt disoriented &amp; very unwell.  Over the next few days, low BP was noted @90/62, pulse 58.  This occurred intermittently.

After 30 minutes, I was released, though still had those symptoms the rest of that day. The EMT at the site thought I&#39;d had a mild allergic response. 36 hours after the shot, I woke up itching a lot on my head, trunk, and arms. I saw no obvious rash (maybe a little mottling) or hives. I used a small dab of Benadryl cream on the itchiest spot. The symptoms disappeared  pretty soon.

The patient did not know if it is the vaccine but she got really weird smell and then her lips and her tongue were all this kind of swelled and then like it was steamed. The patient stated, &#34;In the tongue and my lips, it was like when you get chilli on them and a distinct type of smell. &#34; And then her arm, both of her arms went numb and she had like sort of a hard time breathing. Now, that it went away but she just waited and waited and it lasted almost in the most of the night and then she could not go to sleep but it was something she had never had before and it was very strange. She did not know if you have that kind of reaction from people or you know if it has come up but she thought she better report it because she had not had my second dose yet. She had to get the second dose on 09Feb. No treatments were received. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                hemoptysis; short breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm), on 21Jan2021 18:00, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included osteoporosis; there were no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no Covid prior vaccination. The vaccine was given at the hospital.

I approached her and she confirmed having some tightness in her throat with some difficulty swallowing.  She denied any SOB, no tingling of lips or swelling of tongue, no rash or hives. VS at 1040 were 142/84, 94 and 99%, skins W/D.  911 was called, and medication administration was held at that time without any other symptoms and pt wanted to wait as well on having any other medications administered at that time.  Pt was advised to alert us of any further symptoms.  Constant monitoring was done while waiting for EMS.  Pt was taken off of an antibiotic last week with PCN in it and while experiencing some mild symptoms.  Pt was on a 30min hold post having the Pfizer vaccine to the left deltoid due to having allergies to PCN.  It was approx. 12 minutes after her vaccine when the symptoms started. Her second set of VS at 1049 were 140/80, 78, and 99%.  No change in symptoms, pt remains calm without any SOB or hives. At 1056 pt states that it is getting easier to swallow. AMR on scene to evaluate.  Pt had no further symptoms and continued to feel better. Pt signed out AMA with AMR unit 461.  Pt was advised to call 911 back if any further symptoms arise.

                                                Patient received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine today at 1330, she waited the required 15 minute observation time, was feeling fine and left. She returned to the vaccine clinic around 1415 reporting that she was having trouble breathing. Security called the charge nurses and alerted them that a patient needed assistance. Writer came out to patient who was seated in her car. We assessed patient who was visibly having difficulty breathing and was unable to respond to questions without difficulty breathing. Emergency medication box was opened and epinephrine was prepped. We assessed patients allergies and recent medications taken. Patient denied hx of breathing problems or anxiety. Pt denied chest pain. Per protocol for potential allergic reaction, 0.3ml of epi was given at approximately 1426 via IM injection in the pt&#39;s left arm. ED triage nurse was called and asked to come assist. Two ED technicians with stretcher arrived and with writer  accompanying them transported pt to ED.

                                                48 hours after shot in left arm I started to have a earache on left side, traveled down the left side of face, into jaw area and down left side of my throat like tonsils and into neck area.  Into 72 hours after shot my face, neck and throat area started swelling.  At that time I went to ER for assistance due to the swelling and pain.  The ER after taking  review thought it a infected saliva gland and treated me for that.  As told by ER if no large progress contact my local Dr. and see ENT.  On Tues. (one week from Covid injection) I was in touch with my local  Dr. they had me come to their office for some care and scheduled me with a ENT.  They have been able to get the profuse swelling down out of the left side of my face, neck and throat.  I&#39;m scheduled for a CT scan on March 5, 2021 to see where the original problem started.  I&#39;m contacting  you for two reason&#39;s  1.  I have a March 10th. appointment scheduled I need to cancel and am having issues doing this.  Even in light of all this I want to reschedule for late April for my second shot and am not able to do that as well.   2.  Can you assist with any information if this has happened to other folks and if I should be clear to take my second dose.  This has been quite a nightmare and hard to bring under control.  I believe in the vaccine and this maybe just a quirk in how it happened but any information you can give me would be welcome.  I have looked on the website and it does say that there have been people who have also had symptoms like this from the shots where the side they get the shot on reacts.  Thanking you in advance for your time and assistance.

                                                Within 10 minutes I became nauseous. I left the vaccination center and drove home becoming increasing ill. When I got home I went to bed and slept for two days, nauseous, weak, body aches, a rash under the vaccinated arm and on my back left side,  headaches, fever, sleep interruption, vivid dreams.  The left arm which had been vaccinated was extremely sore and remained so, just recently lessening.  I believe I had Covid 19 in February of 2020 and while I got ill, did not experience the severity of illness that I experienced after vaccination. Now, 17 days later I continue to experience weakness, headaches and recently have had difficulty breathing after exercise. Although the rash has gone away, the left side is still itchy, but less so.     I have discussed this with my Doctor and he informed me that my response to second shot may be stronger, although he did not tell me to avoid the second dose.

Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

She sent me for an x-ray because I had had a recent sinus/respiratory issue.  No pneumonia detected.  She put me on a 5 day dose of 40 mg per day of prednisone.  No change.  I am now having to use a nebulizer daily for breathing.  During the first two weeks following the first vaccine I smelled smoke to the point it woke me up in the middle of the night and I walked around my home to see if anything was on fire.

                                                Patient is a 71-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity who presents with complaint of acute onset shortness of breath.  She reports she was walking around her house earlier when she suddenly became short of breath.  She denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling but states that shortness of breath persisted.  She denies any tobacco, alcohol or drug use and states she has never had any symptoms similar to this before.  Denies any lung disease or heart disease previously.  She does have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is on metoprolol and rosuvastatin respectively which she reports good compliance.  Denies family history of MI or strokes.  She also denies other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or lower extremity edema.  In the ED vitals were found to be within normal limits.  EKG was obtained showing diffuse T wave inversions, right bundle branch block, no ST changes, no hypertrophy.  Troponin found to be elevated at 0.137, creatinine elevated at 1.3, BUN 26.  Chest x-ray was within normal limits.  Otherwise lab work was unremarkable.  She was given aspirin and Nitropaste Hospital Course:         Patient was admitted to the medical floor and remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay. She actually remained asymptomatic and had no further shortness of breath. She was not hypoxic, at no point required supplemental oxygen. Her troponins however continued to uptrend to 0.389. Cardiology consulted, she was medically optimized with increased statin dose, therapeutic lovenox, and aspirin. Original plan was for cardiac catheterization. However, a d-dimer was ordered which returned elevated to 13.7. CTA was performed which revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with large clot burden and concern for right heart strain. Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV with mild diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation. She was deemed not to be candidate for EKOS. Troponin elevation was felt to be type II NSTEMI 2/2 PE.  PE was classified as unprovoked as she has no definite risk factors for this: no prior DVT/PE, no family history of clotting disorder, no evidence of malignancy (UTD with cancer screenings and visits PCP q6m for health maintenance), no cell line abnormalities, no prolonged immobility or long trips or surgeries, no trauma, no hormone or steroid therapies or even antidepressants. She is obese, and has mild CKD. She tested negative for COVID-19 by antigen testing. The only identifiable change in her health habits recently was receiving the first COVID-vaccine dose on 3/18. We discharged her with Eliquis with instructions to taper from 10BID to 5BID after 7 days. As she will be on anticoagulation, the benefit will likely outweigh the risk of receiving the second COVID dose.  She will follow up with her PCP and hematology/oncology.

                                                She awoke and realized her tongue was swelling; She awoke and realized her throat felt like it was closing; had pain go through to the top of her head, and she thought her head was going to explode; she closed her eyes because the light was giving her severe pain in her eyes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 08Mar2021 at 15:00 (batch/lot number: EN6205) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pityriasis rubra pilaris from Oct2012 and ongoing - she was in remission since Sep2015 and it wouldn&#39;t ever go away fully; an ablation of all 4 heart chambers, and then was put on apixaban (ELIQUIS); back surgery, and now had no feeling in her right leg from the right knee down; her heart had stopped 3 times in the past, and she was brought back each time; had to use a 4-prong cane for the rest of her life; premature ventricular contractions (PVCs); and sinus problems. Concomitant medication included atenolol (50 mg tablet; manufacturer: Zydus Pharmaceuticals) taken as heart medication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took methotrexate, steroids, and adalimumab (HUMIRA) for pityriasis rubra pilaris from Jan2014 to Sep2015 and experienced atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She clarified she did not have the adalimumab NDC, lot, and expiration that caused the AFIB. She stated pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) was a rare dermatological autoimmune disease and she was in remission since Sep2015 and it wouldn&#39;t ever go away fully. She took methotrexate, steroids and adalimumab. She said it took 3 doctors before she found a dermatologist who saved her life. She said the &#34;PRP&#34; covered 99% of her body at the time she was diagnosed. She said she was on adalimumab from Jan2014 until she went into remission in Sep2015. The patient received the first dose on 08Mar2021, when returned on 29Mar2021, unable to receive second dose. Stated primary care physician ordered blood work to test for antibodies, asking if this was the only way to indicate immunity. She got the first COVID-19 vaccine, and they will not let her have the second COVID-19 vaccine because she had such an adverse reaction to the first COVID-19 vaccine. She said no one would give her any information about the COVID-19 vaccine or answer any of her questions. She said her problem with the COVID-19 vaccine was she had an underlying condition. She said she was 71 years old, and had been through it all. She reported she was in remission for her autoimmune disease. She said she was put on adalimumab for her autoimmune disease, and the adalimumab sent her into AFIB. She said she had to have an ablation of all 4 heart chambers, and then was put on apixaban. She said she then had back surgery, and now had no feeling in her right leg from the right knee down. She said her heart had stopped 3 times in the past, and she was brought back each time. She said she was lucky to be alive, and didn&#39;t want to complain because she knows there are other that have it worse than her. She tried to get her second COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, 29Mar2021. She said after she told the COVID-19 vaccination staff what happened after her first COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccination staff all freaked out. She said the COVID-19 vaccination staff told her she couldn&#39;t get the second COVID-19 vaccine dose. She and her husband went through a drive-thru COVID-19 vaccination facility, and she was on the passenger side of the car. She said she got her COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. She said because of her issue with her right leg, she had physical therapy for 3 years, and now had to use a 4-prong cane for the rest of her life. She said a male nurse at the COVID-19 vaccination facility helped her out of the car, and administered the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. She said she had an immediate reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. On 08Mar2021, she said she had pain go through to the top of her head, and she thought her head was going to explode. She said the pain in her head hurt so bad. She said she closed her eyes because the light was giving her severe pain in her eyes. She said the male nurse made her husband move their car into another lane, and she had to wait for 30-45 minutes in the car. She said her headache got worse, and the male nurse made her lay down in the car while she waited. She said she didn&#39;t have any further adverse reaction while she was at the (name). She said when she got home, 2 hours later, her husband made her lay down because he didn&#39;t want her to go into AFIB. She clarified she had PVCs, and knew when her heart was OK, and when it was not. She said she didn&#39;t want to go into AFIB. She said she took her heart medication (Atenolol 50 mg). She clarified she took Atenolol 50 mg 3 times a day. She clarified she arrived home at 4:00PM, when she would normally take her second daily dose of Atenolol 50 mg. She clarified after she got home she laid in bed in the dark, and put a cold wash rag over her eyes. She said she must have dozed off, and when she awoke realized her tongue was swelling and her throat felt like it was closing. She said it was about an hour later, at 5:00PM. She said her husband wanted to take her to the emergency room of a hospital that was about 40 minutes away in (name), but she felt the emergency room was too far away. She said her husband gave her 2 doses of Benadryl (25 mg tablets). She clarified she took 1 Benadryl 25 mg tablet, and waited about a half an hour before she took the second Benadryl 25 mg tablet. She said she took another dose of Atenolol 50 mg because the Atenolol brings her blood pressure right down. She said she was fine after 2 hours.  She clarified her tongue swelling and throat closing resolved by 10:00PM on 08Mar2021. She said her husband gave her that length of time to recover before deciding if he had to take her to the hospital in (name). Treatment was Benadryl 25 mg pink tablet (stated she took 1 Benadryl 25 mg tablet twice, about a half hour between doses) (NDC Number: 50580-226-50, Lot Number: KHL0000; Expiration Date: Jul2022). Stated she can&#39;t take generic medication because it doesn&#39;t do anything. Reported because her eyes were so bad, so can&#39;t drive anymore, and needed a magnifying glass to read the Benadryl NDC Number on the product label. Reported the Atenolol 50 mg tablet was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle and had no NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said the Atenolol 50 mg tablet manufacturer was Zydus Pharmaceuticals. Reported she had headaches for 2 weeks after receiving her COVID-19 vaccine. She said the headache happened between 3:00PM-4:00PM every afternoon at the top of her head. She said the headaches would last until 11:00PM when she went to bed. She said the headaches were not bad, but a dull ache. She said she had sinus problems, and knew the difference between a sinus headache, and a headache at the top of her head. She declined any headache treatment, saying she didn&#39;t take over-the-counter medications, like Advil, because over-the-counter medications were bad for her heart. Reported she knew Pfizer had done clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine with 60,000 people, and she knew she was going to be the exception with her pityriasis rubra pilaris. Events did not require emergency room visit and physician office visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.

The present do not think labs are necessary.  She is been advised to monitor her symptoms at home and return for any concerns.  I recommended Benadryl as well as short course of prednisone.  She has received prednisone here and advised her to take prednisone tomorrow and then discuss additional doses with her primary doctor control

                                                I was fine when getting the injection and my ½ hour wait. I was fine during dinner and after dinner and until about 9 hours after the injection when my arm felt exceedingly sore. I had been watching a free Amazon Prime cute movie while knitting a blanket for my grandson. When the movie was over and I was clearing my knitting, I noticed my super sore arm. I got up to check my face in the mirror to be sure that I was not having a reaction. But I did have a reaction with a rash on my chest and face 9 hours after the injection. My arm really hurt for three days but is fine now.  When I saw my red face and chest, I took a Zyrtex D and a Benadryl.  It did not seem to help the redness to go away. When I felt some tightening of my throat and started to feel that I might be starting to lose some clarity of thought, I quickly watched a minute video on how to use my new kind of generic epipen and jabbed myself in the leg and called 911.    I felt much better after the epipen in terms of my thinking and throat.  Basically, the medics that came to the house and said that I had taken what they would give me at the hospital and it was up to me if I wanted to go to the emergency room or not; they would take me but I would need a ride home. With the pandemic and 48 new cases, I decided to stay home and I went to bed; the rash on my face was gone in the morning. The next days I just felt muscle soreness all through my body (day 2) and felt tired (next two days) but had no fever at any time.  I am fine today. I appear to have two very small areas on my chest that probably related to the reaction.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

                                                Patient received her first Pfizer dose with no problems. She came back at her scheduled appointment for the second dose of Pfizer. She initially did well, but after 30-40 minutes the patient came back to the pharmacy complaining of chest pain and felt her throat was tightening up. She felt it was from the vaccine and not from any other reason. I asked her if I could call a paramedic and she declined. I asked about calling a family member/ friend and she also declined. I gave her 5ml of liquid Benadryl and asked her to continue sitting in the pharmacy.  After apx. 10-15 minutes she stated she was starting to feel better. I checked on her every few minutes and kept her in my view the entire time. After apx. 30 more minutes she stated feeling a lot better and wanted to go home. I again offered to call someone or call paramedics and she adamantly refused. I gave her some additional Bendadryl to take home with instructions to take 5 ml every 4 hours for the rest of the day. She left the store. After a apx. 5 minutes a technician went out to see if she had left. She spoke to the patient in her car and patient stated she was fine and heading home. She stated she could drive b/c she only lives a couple minutes from the store. I called the patient at home later that night to check on her and she stated feeling fine, and thanked me for checking on her.

She had an elevated blood pressure and was said was short of breath.  We took her blood pressure, had her sit in front of the pharmacy so we could monitor her until her son came and picked her up.  Just talked to her on the phone and she is doing fine.

At 11 pm went to bed with large lump in my throat, felt like I was breathing thru a straw plus whole body freezing from inside out. Could not get warm. Added layers of clothes and blankets and laid like that all nite, no sleep. 7am called nurse, advised to remove some of the layers, drink hot liquids and Tylenol every four hours. By mid afternoon the cold was gone but severe achy bones, even the bottom of my feet hurt. Next day hot and cold and ache. Fourth day dripping sweat all day and flu like symptoms. Took three showers to get sweats down plus the entire time had been taking Tylenol every four hours. Day five just drained, felt like I&#39;d been through the wringer.

It was reported that the patient couldn&#39;t articulate words clearly due to stuttering. She would be thinking a particular word but would say a different one. This has subsided, but she was concerned as to whether she should take the second one as it&#39;s apparently affecting her brain. Also, mild symptoms of brain fog, feeling lightheaded and off balance, pressure on my chest which made breathing slightly more labored, pressure in my ears and throat, my palms turned red. All the events occurred on 01Mar2021 at 13:45. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t articulate words clearly/thinking a particular word but would say a different one and stuttering was recovered on Mar2021 and recovering for the rest of the events.

                                                While waiting at the pharmacy the requested 15 minutes after getting the shot, I started to feel intense tingling in my left arm (the arm that received the shot) and achiness in my elbow and wrist.  The intensity gradually lessened but did not go away. I spoke to the pharmacist who suggested that I wait another 15 minutes. After a total of 30 minutes, the intense tingling had lessened (but was still present) so after talking with the pharmacist again I left to go home.   As I was heading home the tingling moved to my head, neck and upper chest and I began to feel a tightness in my throat. I was able to swallow but had the sensation that my throat was closing up.  After several hours the sensation had not gone away

Throat itching began within the first 5-6 minutes post vaccine; nurses in attendance gave me 25mg Benadryl within first 10 minutes and a second 25mg dose after the next 15 min...the diphenhydramine didn&#39;t take effect.  The nurse took my BP and attached a device to monitor my oxygen level.  After another 15 minutes, I felt disoriented, my voice became hoarse and I could barely talk...the nurse told me that my oxygen saturation was still good.  I began to feel nauseated and had stomach cramps and bowel urgency.  At that point, the nurse in attendance brought a wheelchair and took me to the ER, allowing me to stop to use the restroom.  ER physician gave me famotidine 20mg and oral prednisone and watched me for 2&#43; hours.  When I felt more oriented, they allowed me to go home.  I did not require epinephrine, but the ER physican told me that I should NOT take the second dose.  I followed up at home with  Benadryl 25mg bid for 4 days.  My voice returned in 6 days. I followed up my primary care physician, on Jan. 23rd...she also told me not to take the second dose.  My primary care also advised me NOT to take the second dose.  Please note:  ran a basic  blood panel as a part of my annual physical on Jan. 27th.  The results came back with all my levels totally off the chart!!   She had the test repeated on Feb. 16th and all my levels were back to normal.  She noted that the discrepancy must have been a result of my reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and suggested that she would let her patients know NOT to have bloodwork done within 14 days of their COVID vaccine.

                                                I started being really short of breath and felt pain/inflammation in lower body. I remember telling my brother I hurt everywhere below my waist; was just home from work where on my feet unless I sit down to rest. It all culminated with increased breathlessness and went to emergency at hospital at 8:30 pm on April 22, 2021.  Diagnosis was MANY pulmonary embolisms, some large. I have taken week long road trips for the past several years with  hours and hours at the wheel with no problems.   It just seems like a real strange coincidence of the vaccine and subsequent symptoms.

The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

States O2 sitting 97 and P 79-80 and O2 walking &lt;88 and P 100&#39;s. States had covid vaccine # 1 on 3/4/2021. Completed viral/travel screen which was negative. Patient is a 72 y.o. female with chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, depression with anxiety, who presented with shortness of breath on exertion.  CTA chest was performed, showing filling defects in  secondary and tertiary pulmonary arterial branches in bilateral lower lobes as well as right upper lobe.  Patient was admitted for management of acute bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Patient was started on Lovenox 1 mg/kg twice daily; transitioned over to oral apixaban for discharge. TTE obtained, without evidence of right heart strain. Patient is a 72 y.o. female who presents to the office today stating &#34;I do not feel so good&#34;.   She mentions noting blurry vision over the past 1 week right eye only with decreased vision.  Denies any eye pain.  Thinks her vision is worse outside in the sun.   In addition, today she states she was up moving around getting ready for today&#39;s appointment when all of a sudden she felt a brief slight low light shock pointing to left anterior chest wall.  Denies any chest pain or pressure but reports noting her heart rate was elevated up to 150.  She states her O2 sat at home was 97% on room air.  She checked her blood pressure which was not abnormal but cannot recall the number.   She was recently diagnosed with a PE for which she was hospitalized, see previous note.  She is concerned as she feels perhaps her Covid vaccine initially received on 3/4/2021 could have caused her blood clot.  Her second dose was received on 3/31/2021 and has since not been feeling well EKG in the office with new onset A. fib relation noted, rapid ventricular rate with a pulse of 152 bpm.  911 was called and patient transferred to the ER for further evaluation and recommendations.

Of note, patient had received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 4/10/2021.  She had scheduled this primary care provider appointment due to waxing and waning blurred vision of her right eye, with associated right-sided headache that had been ongoing over the last week.  Patient reports that on the day of arrival she had not felt well, felt slightly weak and fatigued, but denied shortness of breath, chest pain or heart palpitations.  Per ER notes, patient was instructed on vagal maneuvers while she was in the ambulance, and had converted to sinus rhythm by the time of her arrival to the emergency room.  Per review of her telemetry on the day of discharge, patient did have one short episode of PAF on 4/15/2021, spontaneously converting to sinus rhythm, as well was intermittent PACs.  Her home lisinopril was changed to Coreg, without further episodes of RVR and with good blood pressure control.   In regards to her headache, patient underwent an MRI of the brain, which was negative for acute findings; she had no temporal tenderness, and ESR was within normal limits.  She did improve symptomatically with administration of Tylenol and Zofran for her corresponding nausea/vomiting.  On the day of discharge, patient was feeling much better, and stable for discharge.  An appointment with doctor of ophthalmology was offered to patient for 4/16/2021, however due to transportation issues, this was rescheduled for 4/20/2021.  She was instructed on changes in her medication, as well as encouraged to schedule an appointment with her established cardiologist.  All questions and concerns were addressed.

Who presented to the emergency room after a fall in her house on 4/14.  She had significant face pain and was hypoxic with an O2 saturation of 68% on room air on presentation.  She was then found to be Covid positive.  Initially admitted to the medical floor however required increasing amounts of oxygen and was ultimately transferred to the ICU on 4/16.  She was maintained on nonrebreather oxygen until the evening of 4/21 when she was intubated and increasing vasopressor requirements.

A 72-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: E11283) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 72-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included &#34;HTH GERD&#34; and sulfa allergy, both from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications (received within two weeks of the vaccination) included pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX), losartan and anastrazole, all taken for unspecified indications on unspecified dates. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received demerol for an unspecified indication on an unspecified date and experienced allergy (reported as &#34;known allergies: Eli sulfa demerol&#34;). On 08Jan2021 at 12:00 the patient experienced severe cellulitis on trunk anterior/ posterior, elevated temp white count pain, fatigue, SOB (shortness of breath) and chest pain. All events were serious for hospitalization on an unspecified date, for 5 days. All events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The events required treatment with antibiotics for 6 weeks. The clinical outcomes of the events severe cellulitis on trunk anterior/ posterior, elevated temp white count pain, fatigue, SOB (shortness of breath) and chest pain were all recovered/resolved with sequel (recovered with lasting effects) on an unspecified date. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available the reported events more likely represent intercurrent medical conditions that were unlikely related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).

                                                3/9 MHN, admitted day after covid vaccine with weakness/SOB. Patient with history of small cell lung cancer metastatic on chemotherapy, COPD, diabetes, Sjogren&#39;s who presents with shortness of breath, confusion, and generalized fatigue as well as fall 1 week ago found to have recurrent pleural effusion, T7 fracture, new metastases, UTI. Shortness of breath: Suspicion is that this is related to malignancy plus effusion.  Shortness of breath markedly improved after removal of Transudative fluid, 470cc obtained on thora 3/10 with cytology negative. Encephalopathy: Daughter notes that she has been more confused.  The patient is off on her timeline of details.  CT shows no evidence of brain metastases nor does recent MRI.  Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient is on 3 L of oxygen at baseline and she is currently at baseline. Generalized weakness: Her neuro exam is nonfocal aside from her confusion of timeline.  CT and MRI have been unremarkable.  I discussed her T7 fracture with spine surgery who recommends CT of entire spine which showed additional metastases.  Patient has no pain and has declined the need for brace. Metastatic small cell lung cancer: Patient admits that she does not like to talk much about the big picture however her daughter at bedside did speak with me outside the room and understands that she may have a poor prognosis.  UTI: With increased frequency/urgency/incontinence.  There is trace leuk esterase on UA.  She has been on ceftriaxone but urine culture showing 80,000 colonies of Enterococcus.  Changed to vancomycin.  I discussed with the microbiology lab who stated that sensitivities would not be available until 3/13.  Discharged with sensitivities pending initially with plan for amoxicillin but given interaction with methotrexate change to Macrobid. Normocytic anemia: Likely related to malignancy and chemotherapy.  No blood loss has been noted.  She received 1 unit RBCs prior to discharge.

                                                Within 1 week of receiving COVID vaccine,I started having left leg pain that lasted until hospitalization. I?ve had sciatica before and thought it was this. After second COVID vaccine(03/02/2021),started getting shortness of breath  that continued to get worse. Finally, in mid-April, along with the shortness of breath and left leg pain, I started getting right,mid back pain that radiated to right chest and shoulder. On April 21,2021, I  could no longer tolerate the chest and back pain and drove myself to ER and Urgent Care. The Dr. ordered a CT Angio of chest and determined I had bilateral pulmonary embolism and sent me by ambulance to Hospital.

                                                Slight puffiness on her left cheek; Swollen lymph nodes; Light tightness in her throat; Her lymph nodes remain just a little tender but are no longer swollen; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0179), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 14May2021 08:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) on 20Apr2019, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) blood clots following a surgery 2 years before. Concomitant medications included simvastatin taking for a year and a half at 100 mg one time per day for blood cholesterol, fenofibrate taking for years at 145 mg tablet one time a day by mouth for blood cholesterol, apixaban (ELIQUIS) at 5 mg tablet twice a day by mouth for blood clots from 20Apr2019, alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX) taking for about 6 months or so at 35 mg one tablet on Mondays for bone density abnormal, eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA) at 1VM capsule, 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at night, and a lot of vitamins taking for years. The patient experienced a slight puffiness on her left cheek, very swollen lymph nodes, and light tightness in her throat when she woke up on 15May2021. She said she took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) which helped make her feel better. She thought she only had a mild reaction since she did not feel the need to call (with held). Patient wanted to know if she should still receive the 2nd dose based on the reaction she had with the 1st dose. They told her if she had a reaction she would have within a few minutes or an hour of getting the vaccine, she was just different, she would have reactions to some things the next day. Within a day the lymph nodes went down and she felt like it had cleared up, her lymph nodes remained just a little tender but were no longer swollen. Outcome of the events was resolving.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: SL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 12Jan2021 at 10:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took varicella zoster vaccine (SHINGLES VACCINE) for immunization and had a little reaction but just the normal things. On Tuesday morning, the patient got the COVID-19 shot and was fine. This morning (15Jan2021), the patient was not feeling great, has a slight headache, her breathing is heavier, and below her breast line is a tightness she can&#39;t really describe. The patient asked if these were a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and wondering if this is normal. As a treatment for the events, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient asked if she can or should get a test, a COVID-19 test. It has been so many days since having the vaccine, 4 days later, she is wondering if she might have COVID-19. The patient isn&#39;t sure and is just asking a question. It is confirmed that she has not had a test or tested positive for COVID-19. The outcome of &#34;Not feeling great&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

                                                Patient reported an anaphylactic reaction  (throat swelling, trouble breathing) to ibuprofen. She also indicated she developed a rash all over her body to a flu vaccine in 1970s, attributed to her egg allergy. Due to her extensive allergies and the fact that she has not gotten a vaccine since 1970s, I would need to monitor her for 30 minutes. (Even though none of her allergies cross react with ingredients in covid Pfizer vaccine. I gave patient vaccine and had her sit in waiting  room to be monitored. After 5 or so minutes I noticed her head down, I asked if she was feeling okay she said yes just very tired. I asked if any trouble breathing she said no but her mouth feels dry. Another five minutes go by and patients head is down again, I again ask if she is okay she says yes just very tired and she wasn&#39;t before vaccine. I ask if any trouble breathing/swallowing, she said it&#39;s a little hard to swallow but she thinks its because her mouth is dry. I get patient a water and ask if she is okay if I give her a Benadryl. She says yes so I give her 50mg Benadryl by mouth. Another 5 minutes go by and again I have to ask patient how she was feeling, she said fine. I ask how her throat is, she says it just feels kind of tight. Due to this progression of allergic reaction (although slow, clearly progressing)  I told patient I will have to call for an ambulance. Paramedics showed up after 5-10 minutes and took care of patient. I relayed all this info to them as well as the dispatcher on the phone. Paramedics took patient to hospital conscious and breathing on her own.

A 73-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose intramuscular on 03Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at nursing home/senior living facility. Medical history included alcohol use, diverticulitis, iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), asthma, hypertension, anxiety, recent C. diff infection, allergies to penicillin. She was not pregnant. The patient had not experienced Covid-19 prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included apixaban (APIXABAN), bioflavonoids nos, calcium ascorbate, hesperidin, rutoside, sodium ascorbate, zinc amino acid chelate (VITAMIN C [BIOFLAVONOIDS NOS;CALCIUM ASCORBATE;HESPERIDIN;RUTOSIDE;SODIUM ASCORBATE;ZINC AMINO ACID CHELATE]), cyanocobalamin (B-12), furosemide (LASIX), simethicone (manufacturer unknown), tramadol (manufacturer unknown), vancomycin (manufacturer unknown) oral, omeprazole (PROTONIX), amlodipine (manufacturer unknown), vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN), thiamine (manufacturer unknown), aripiprazole (ABILIFY), atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR), clonazepam (KLONOPIN), folic acid (manufacturer unknown), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT). The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 10Jan2021, 7 days after getting vaccine, the patient developed shortness of breath and fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, O2 sat 70% on RA, now intubated and in multiorgan failure. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness for immediate risk of death from the event. The patient was hospitalized for the events for 18 days. Patient received treatment with corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals, dialysis, mechanical ventilation, inhaled Epoprostinol. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: unknown in Jan2021. Pre / post vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with unknown result. The with outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal gap between the vaccination and the event onset, the Company considered that there was not a reasonable possibility that the events were related to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. The patient&#39;s advanced age, underlying medical conditions and multiple concomitant medications could be contributory to the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                Patient presented to the ED shortly after receiving her COVID vaccine with hypertension, altered mental status, and a near syncopal episode upon arrival at the ED. Patient also reported some throat tightness and nausea. Patient received the first does of the Pfizer COVID vaccine about one hour PTA. Patient began having hypertension noted to be in the 180-215 systolics and patient reports baseline of 120s systolic. Patient was brought directly from the vaccine clinic to the ED. Upon arrival at the ED, patient experienced a syncopal episode and eventually came out of this but was confused. It was reported in the notes that patient was slightly dehydrated which could have contributed to her symptoms. Once the patient recovered from this episode and hypertension was resolved, patient was discharged home to follow up with PCP.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine,  on Jan 28th, I noticed pain in my right lower back area.  It went away so I didn?t pay much attention to it.  On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

About 14 minutes after the shot she felt mildly short of breath.  Reportedly there was no signs of increased work of breathing.  She had no throat swelling or change in voice.  Patient reports these symptoms were different from her baseline asthma so the decision to call a Code 44 was made and she was brought to the ED.  Since that event her symptoms have improved.  She denies any chest pain or pressure.  She denies any recent illness prior to the event.  She denies any lightheadedness or syncope.

The hives presented as large welts all very itchy. I applied Calamine lotion and took a Loratadine pill, and the hives and itch subsided dramatically. I also developed flu-like symptoms of malaise and wheezing. At no time did I have a fever nor did my throat swell or close. Saturday, 24 hours after the first Loratadine pill, the hives and swelling reappeared but disappeared within 15 minutes of taking another Loratadine pill. Sunday through today, the swollen knees and wheeze remain but diminished in severity

Patient received her second dose of the covid vaccine on 2/19/21, 3 days prior to presentation. The following day, she started having &#34;breathing issues&#34; so she was given a dose of prednisone. 1 day prior to presentation, her breathing had improved but she was feeling generally sick, so she was given tylenol but not pred. Then, today, day of admission, patient was having bodyaches, weakness, headache, and breathing issues again. She took prednisone this morning, but still had to turn up her O2 because her work of breathing kept fluctuating. Admitted 2/22/21 ? 2/24/21.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 EUA Vaccine  Pt received first COVID vaccine 2/25/21. Tested positive for COVID late February. Reported to ED 3/5/21 with near syncope. Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

Upon arriving home she states she had extreme fatigue and took a nap which is very unlike her. Then that same day she started to have difficulty breathing after her nap (couldn&#39;t catch her breath). She contacted the pharmacy and later contacted her doctor who told her to wait 48 hours to see if difficulty breathing subsides. Doctor put patient on a Medrol dose pack on 3/25/21. Approximately 5 days after initially receiving vaccine patient developed redness and flushing in her face. The facial redness went away after 3 days. Patient says overall the difficulty breathing occurred for 9 days and it was bad when trying to sleep at night, she kept having to sit up and was gasping. Patient also had acupuncture and a laser treatment done by her physician to help with this adverse effect.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

She then could feel that her throat was full and could still breath, and then felt herself clearing her throat and called the attendant over and she told her to take a Benadryl which they gave her.  She then waited for about 45 minutes and felt better.  She then went home and had stomach cramps which finally went away, possibly related to her nerves.  She did call her doctor who told her to take Benadryl before taking the 2nd vaccine, which her PA told her that she should wait until after she got the vaccine, so is unsure if she should or not.  She was scheduled to have the 2nd on 4/6/21 but did not get it.

The patient presents with Nausea and vomiting. A 73 year old female with a history of UTI and DM was brought to the ED today due to having nausea and vomiting for the past couple of days. She was administered Zofran by EMS; they checked her BS which was 171. The patient states she has been sick since the eighth of this month, and has had diarrhea, dysuria, and  arm pain. She reports not taking her insulin since February due to her insurance no longer covering her. .  The onset was 3  days ago.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is unknown.  The degree at present is moderate.  The exacerbating factor is none.  The relieving factor is none.  Risk factors consist of diabetes mellitus. Therapy today: emergency medical services.  Associated symptoms: diarrhea.  4/30/21: A 73-year-old female, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 with chronic kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency from renal cell carcinoma and adrenalectomy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with portal hypertension, esophageal varices, has had nausea and vomiting for several days.  She did receive her second COVID-19 vaccination on April 8, and has had ongoing symptoms since that time, much worse in the 3 days prior to admission. An initial COVID screen was negative, but rechecking the PCR COVID test was positive.  Initially, she did not require any oxygen, but did require 2 L nasal cannula at night on the second night, at which time remdesivir and convalescent plasma were administered.  She was also given dexamethasone, but had marked rise in her blood sugar to greater than 400. The dexamethasone was tapered and stopped.  Glucose regulated with insulin.  The patient initially had severe anorexia, poor oral intake, but this slowly improved.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis has shown the small nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  There is some ascites and mild pleural effusions.  The patient had been receiving some IV fluids, and we would discontinue the Lasix because of low blood pressure.  There was no other obvious explanation for her poor oral intake or abdominal pain. The patient had IV access problems and eventually, despite the PICC line and midlines being attempted, we were unable to complete a successful IV to finish her CAP antibiotics or the remdesivir. The patient seemed to be doing better, oxygen is 98% on room air, blood pressure 98/63 and 116/60.  We are holding the Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.  The glucose has been running at 213, 154, and 202.  BUN at 35, creatinine 1.4.  WBC 11,700 and hemoglobin 11.5. The patient was seen on the day of discharge at 1100 hours, doing quite well, and will be discharged home with her family.  We have offered visiting nurses, but she feels that the family is there 24 hours a day.  She does not need any visiting nurses.  We have made some changes to her medications, and she will need to follow up with her primary doctor in the next week to see whether we need to restart Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Will be hydrocortisone 15 mg a.m., 5 mg evening, venlafaxine 37.5 daily, venlafaxine 150 mg at bedtime, rifaximin 550 mg b.i.d., Bactrim DS 1 daily, multivitamins daily, insulin glargine 35 units at bedtime, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, NovoLog 20 units before meals.  Again, we are holding Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.

                                                4/21/21 Pt was reportedly admitted to the Hospital for generalized weakness. Her nephrologist noted worsening renal function and had her admitted for hemodialysis. Of note, she had not been able to keep her appointment for mAB due to weakness. At the outlying hospital she had a palliative consult and started dialysis. First day of RRT was 4/24/21. Approximately one hour after dialysis she developed 10/10 CP and her EKG changed from a partial LBBB to a complete LBBB. She was transferred to a different Hospital for further evaluation. Her BP was fairly labile and troponins were positive. Approx 7 hours after arrival, she became unresponsive. Heart rate was very irregular in what appeared to be a fib. Transcutaneous pacing was initiated. She was given several amps of bicarb and started on a dopamine infusion. Her daughter arrived shortly thereafter and the pt became apneic. She was transitioned to comfort care and death was pronounced at 04:13 on 4/25/21.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

                                                My mom only had site soreness after her covid vaccine on 1/21 which resolved within a couple days. However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

Currently I am treating myself at home with an albuterol nebulizer and Advair inhaler treatments, Advil and Tylenol for fever.  I have supplemental oxygen for use as needed - am continuing to monitor O2 sats.  Pushing fluids.  After one week, I&#39;m not really improving.

Few hours later I noted gradual increase in muscle and joint ache, no increase in body temp. and sudden onset of fatigue.  I am  a very active person - playing tennis 3 - 4x/wk, hiking 4 - 6 miles twice a week, biking, dancing, etc.  Most symptoms subsided within 24 hours, but fatigue still persists on the third day following  the injection.  Had to stop normal activity,  less fatigue but still need to stop after 20 minutes of standing or walking to sit and rest,

                                                February 17, 2021:  Patient received 1st dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine.  Reported mild cough, nausea and bone pain lasting one week. However, she felt it wasn&#39;t severe enough to contact me as her asthma specialist.  No cough per patient for the week prior to the second dose of PfizerBioNTech. March 10, 2021:  Patient received 2nd dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine at 1:10pm.  Said she had mild chest tightness during the waiting period and used her Ventolin but she attributed it to the characteristics of the waiting room area.  Between 5:00pm and 6:00pm (~4 hours later), she became light-headed, vomited and began to cough frequently.  She contacted her primary care physician who told her to use Mucinex and contact me if needed. March 12, 2021:  Patient contacted my office in the early afternoon.  Unable to stop coughing while on telephone.  Came to office approximately 90 minutes later.  Physical Exam;  Peak Flow 210 (personal best 310-320), oxygen saturation 93-95% (typically 97-98%), temp-98.2 F.  Intractable cough with scattered bilateral expiratory wheezes on auscultation.  Heart rate 132 and regular.  Patient treated with Levalbuterol 1.25 mg nebulization with subsequent modest improvement in frequency of cough, pulse 102, oxygen saturation 96-97%.  She declined going to emergency department of hospital because she did not want to get infected with COVID-19 from a patient in the waiting room.  She declined Prednisone when told that the corticosteroid might reduce the efficacy of the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Placed on Budesonide 1 mg bid and Levalbuterol 1.25 mg q4-6h prn. March 16th:  Patient reported her cough was 70% improved and wanted to stop Budesonide.  Patient was told to continue Budesonide daily at 1 mg q day. April 5th:  Patient contacted my office because of continued coughing and wheezing.  Had been hospitalized March 25-27 for the cough.

Stated she was told here she had wheezing, but transported to ER, and lungs were clear, told in ER no wheezing, noted, no albuterol given, no meds or treatment given, work up negative, and was discharged with diagnosis of possible anxiety or possible asthma.  I debated whether to hold vaccine based on the Interim clinical considerations, but since I had no documentation of wheezing and ER visit reported as no wheezing or respiratory problems, I made decision to proceed with pretreatment.  At 25 minutes she developed stridor, wheezing and trouble breathing, no facial tongue swelling and no urticaria.  No hypotension.   Prior to immunization BP was 189/105, Pulse 89, 02 sat 96% ra,  25 minutes after vaccination, Audible stridor, coughing, diffuse tight wheezes with decreased air movement.  Epi 0.3 given.  157/92, 105, O2 sat 98%.     Almost immediately after epi stridor improved, although her wheezes persisted, her air movement improved significantly.  She did not developed hypotension, and she did not lose consciousness.   She was transferred to the hospital.   We pretreated her with benadryl and her albuterol

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 74 years, administered on the left arm on 08Feb2021 12:45 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypersensitivity. Additional Information for Other Conditions: medications, cloves, spices, MSG, processed foods and she can&#39;t take any antibiotics. There were no concomitant medications. The patient wanted to report a less severe reaction she experienced within 10 minutes of the first dose 08Feb2021. After her vaccine within 10 minutes, she started to itch. The patient had a scratchy throat, mental confusion, tightness in her throat. The tightness in her throat she usually experiences with clove, food allergies and antibiotics. She was familiar with what was happening. The side effects did go away. They asked her to stay 30 minutes. As soon as she left, she took one Benadryl and 10 min later she took a second one. Then, it subsided. Her itching did go into the next day. Her throat tightening made her anxious and her respiratory status worse. It happened so quick. Her first concern was conflicting facts sheets in regards to taking the second dose. The patient wanted to know what was recommended. Should she take the second dose. She has never had anaphylaxis so she doesn&#39;t have an Epipen. She can take Benadryl which has gotten her out of more severe responses before. Therapeutic measures (Benadryl) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the event itch was recovered on 09Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 08Feb2021.

First dose of BNT162b2 (Lot number GM or EM9809) was taken on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 74-year-old) in left arm (way up high on the shoulder) for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (due to environmental toxins), allergy to different dyes (allergic to yellow, purple, and blue dye) and allergy to medications. The patient has never been a drinker or smoker. Concomitant medications were not reported. A week or so after the second dose, she thought she was having a cold. It has affected her voice and breathing. She thought she had bronchitis.  She was going to her doctor on 04May2021. She had a hacking cough and she doesn&#39;t know what she has if it isn&#39;t a cold. She wondered if it was connected to the vaccine or is it bronchitis. The more she talks the more difficulty in her chest. She was prescribed Robitussin DM cough syrup by her doctor and was taking honey lemon cough drops. She also had congestion in her chest ever since. She has been having like a cold in her chest. It was heard how she was sounding. She never thought it was connected to the vaccine and never expected this to last for this long. The patient asked whether it could be a residual side effects of the vaccine and questioned if this could have had any effect on the COPD. She stated she was not having any problems with it and she has had it for years. Her cough has been the same, she takes a dose of DM cough syrup or a cough drop during the day. Robitussin was working. She was drinking lots of fluids, between 74-96 ounces of water per day. The doctor told her she had A influenza, but she thought she had COVID because she had all the symptoms, but they said A influenza and treated her for influenza A. That morning she had difficulty breathing like bronchitis, her chest was burning inside and was always like that, her talking aggravates everything and she had deep breathing. Her physician said her chest was clear after she thought she had bronchitis at her previous visit. She does not have any questions, she was calling to report an event, she is calling her doctor for further guidance. Cough, difficulty breathing, voice changed required a visit at physician office. Onset date for hacking cough, voice affected, chest burning, difficulty breathing and chest congestion was 10mar2021, while onset date for the other events was unknown. Hacking cough, voice affected, chest burning, difficulty breathing and chest congestion were not resolved, outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 74-year old contactable female consumer (patient) reported for herself  that she received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot No. unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization on 05Feb2021 at 17:30. Relevant history included Shingles when she was 42, Chicken pox.  Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot No. EL3247) at 0.3 ML single dose for Covid-19 immunization on 15Jan2021, experienced Left arm Pain at injection site. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. The patient went to Urgent care and was diagnosed with Shingles on 15Apr2021, which was started with pain in her side, and on 30Apr2021, she was having breathing problems/ breathing was not well at 15:30-16:00. She said shingles were from the  shot. The patient started shrinking before she got the vaccine. It was years before. There was no prescriber. She did not have the pain from the Shingles any longer. The pain was gone for a couple of days now. She had it for 2 1/2 weeks.  She was cooking and the next day, she said she did not feel good, her heart was pounding and breathing was difficult. She went to ER and they did dimer test. They took 12 vials of blood. They told her she had .30 clot. She later stated the Dimer result was 0.30. They did chest x-ray and nothing showed. They looked at her legs too.  That is why they did the sonogram. They wanted her to stay, but he gave her a sonogram of her heart.  It is not enlarged and there is no fluid around it.  She thought he gave referral for outpatient. She has been calling ER for an appointment.  She then found that the doctor was not able to refer to an Echo cardiogram. She needs to go to the one in her home state and she is still in a different state visiting her daughter. She goes home next week and will get it then. She went for stress test Apr 2019 and emailed results  said she had slight mitral regurgitation, so maybe that is where the blood is coming from.   Her sister called and she told her she did not feel well. Breathing problem only lasted a day. She was cooking again and was not doing anything strenuous and felt palpitations in her chest and felt breathing issues again. It is better, but every now and then she gets palpitations. She had a migraine after second dose at 16:00 (unknown date). She went to bed at 4pm and woke up at 1am. She thought she took an Ibuprofen and did not know if it would affect vaccine or not. When she woke up, she was fine.  She had shingles prior. She assumes she must have had COVID and did not know.  he had the antibodies present in May 2020, when she was tested.  When she googled, the people in another country were getting Shingles. She had the chicken pox when she was young. If you get the Chicken pox and the COVID, you are susceptible to shingles.  She does not have any information on those people in other country to report. Her brother and sister both received the Moderna COVID vaccine. Her brother did not have any issues an her sister already reported her issues to them. No further details provided. Separate report completed for her sister.  When looking up an address, she stated she needs a magnifying glass. She needed this before the vaccine. She always has her glasses to read with. ER visited on 15Apr2001 and 01May2021. On 15 They gave her ketorolac and ondansetron, potassium chloride. because her potassium was low. The outcome of event shingles, breathing problems was resolving, the outcome of other events was unknown.     Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about batch/lot number is expected.

And then around 2PM  I got an extreme tightness in my chest. This lasted a couple hours and then went away, but in the meantime the throat feeling was still there. When I went to bed around midnight it got very scary. I called the ambulance and they looked at my throat. They said they could take me to the hospital or give me Benadryl. I took the Benadryl. During the day I just dealt with it but at night I took Benadryl for 2-3 weeks. I was dizzy and off balance during that time frame as well. I finally went to the DR and he said no second shot absolutely not. Then I saw a heart DR for an EKG and other tests. They said the dizziness could very well be related to the shot, that it could have an effect on people different.

When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart.

Outside the room patient was not able to get a breath, her escort kept her upright and called for help.  Patient was moved into a wheelchair.  I was called to assist.  The patient had provided an epipen and felt her throat was closing.  At this time, approximately 1350 I administered the Epipen.  Shortly thereafter the patient was able to get air again.  Her vitals were monitored for the next ~45 minutes and she progressively felt better. At this time the patient was offered and ER evaluation, but felt she was well enough to go home.  She was transported by her husband and instructed to follow up with her PCP regarding the 2nd dose.  I provided her with an epipen from our Emergency kit, as she did not have another one with her or at home.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine facility type was reported as the &#34;doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.&#34; Relevant medical history included high blood pressure, but it was controlled blood pressure/hypertension; asthma, for which she was not taking medication at the time of the report, because it was under control; non allergic rhinitis; pre diabetes; and a little overweight. The patient further stated that she had just general medical history, which she had everything under control. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and metformin. The patient previously took to iodine, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromycin, for which the patient had known allergies to all of it. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient stated that on 12Jan2021 at 10:30, she had adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine; she had severe allergic reaction within about 30 minutes and then they call the paramedic she ended up and they gave her a shot, which she did not know if it was prednisone. It was further reported that she took her inhaler too as they said she was wheezing, which she didn&#39;t really feel in her lungs. The patient just felt that what happen was she went to the car as they said to wait 15 minutes as written, and she always follow the rules and the whole thing they said, she waited 30 minutes, so she went down side of her car then she figured that she could just drive off drive home. So, she was in car sitting or waiting for the last 30 minutes and all of a sudden she felt right through her chest like through her right side kind of going into her left; it was weird like she could feel going into her body, then suddenly her heart start beating really fast, and then she pulled down the vizor and looked in the rearview mirror and her face was all red, so she go back to the site. That&#39;s how she transpired and then, that&#39;s how the reaction was. It was further reported that the patient waited 15 minutes in the office, then went to car to wait additional 15 minutes, and suddenly felt strange sensation in her chest and her heart started beating very rapidly. She pulled down the visor in car and saw her face growing red and swelling slightly and her breathing was becoming labored. She had read on side effects on information she was given on departure stating symptoms of an allergic reaction. She returned to the facility at which time she was treated. The adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no investigation assessment. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included that the patient was given a shot of 125 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), but another report said they gave her prednisone so they were kind of conflicting in the report, but it was a shot, and also cetirizine (ZYRTEC) and famotidine (PEPCID), and her inhaler for wheezing. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.

The next morning was much better although still a bit tired.  It was very scary but I realized that it was a reaction to the vaccination.

                                                I had no side effects up until 3 days later, 02/25/2021, during lunch my heart started racing and pounding and I could not catch my breath. I tried to relax and eat and I felt like I had indigestion coming on. Then I started feeling very mild tightness in my throat. Later I had mild ringing in my ears. i had intense anxiety from the time my heart started pounding. ALL of these symptoms lasted for 3 days and It only happened when I ate food. I tossed and turned all night and my body was very uncomfortable and I was still extremely anxious. I started getting better after 3 days and took about 9 days to finally start feeling right. Doctor gave me an EKG and said it was fine but sent me to a cardiologist. I had another EKG, ECHO,  24 hour Monitor with a Holter, and a stress test. results pending. PLEASE NOTE: I am allergic to Cipro and I found that there is a common ingredient in Cipro and the Covid vaccines: Polyethylene Glycol Maybe there&#39;s a correlation?

I took a rescue inhaler to see if it would help. I stayed in bed all day wednesday. I coughed all night, I am on O2 all night. I seem to be parched, mouth is dry, drinking a lot of water. Thursday was just as bad, I wasnt feeling well. the breathing gets better a little every day but I am coughing up green mucus so I called my pulmonologist and he called in an antibiotic.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot number: EN6198, expiration date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. There were no problems, no symptoms, no pain or nothing on the day of vaccination. On 13Mar2021, the patient started experiencing swelling of the lip at around 08:30 or 09:00 and itching and swelling on the throat. She didn&#39;t wake up then, she went to sleep and she slept until about 05:45 and she thought it would just go away but there was much more swelling. She took Benadryl but she is concerned about the swelling, it was still there. She took another Benadryl at 04:00 on Sunday and she took one the previous night at 12 o&#39;clock and the swelling has diminished a lot but it was not gone away all together. She was concerned because of 2 reasons, one she was due for another shot in a couple weeks and another reason was she wanted to know if it came from the vaccine. She clarified that the swelling was on her lips, mainly the left side pretty much of her lips. It started with the bottom lip and it was kind of so now that it was the top and bottom, it was both lips on the left side. She gave a lot of thought to this and that night she did have some frozen blueberries and bananas. She never ate blueberries on their own she usually puts them in oatmeal or something like that, so she thought maybe it could be the results of the blueberries since she has never had that. The patient asked whether lip swelling was an expected side effect and whether there was any issue with receiving one dose instead of the two doses.  Limited information was available over the call.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper forearm on 01Mar2021 at the age of 75-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a pharmacy (in a grocery store). The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient&#39;s medical history included retired (retired registered nurse), ongoing depression (has had this condition for probably 20 years), ongoing lung cancer (has had this condition for probably 3 years), ongoing bipolar (has had this condition for about 4 years), ongoing emphysema (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years), and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years). Concomitant medications included duloxetine taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking this probably for 15 years); and arformoterol tartrate (BROVANA) (started taking this probably 5 years ago), budesonide (started taking this probably 5 years ago), tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) (has been taking this for probably about 4-5 years), oxygen (has been using this full time for 3 years), and Trilogy machine (she sleeps with this, it is an invasive intubation. She puts a big mask on and it pumps air in, pulls air out, letting her lungs rest. Her oxygen hooks up to it), all taken for emphysema and COPD from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported that she received the vaccine on 01Mar2021 and sometime in Apr2021 around Easter, she went to the hospital for COPD exacerbation, tiredness and weakness. The patient required a visit to the emergency room due to the events and reported that she went by ambulance to the hospital. The patient stated that she has these events often and it has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine. She went to the hospital with exacerbation of COPD and missed her date to get her last shot. She wanted to know whether she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine with her experience after the 1st dose. The patient reported that she now weighs 177 after she has been pumped full of cortisone. The patient reported that her lung doctor was really the one that manages her medical. The patient reported that she thinks she came home from the hospital the day before Easter and she was in the hospital for 5 days (in Apr2021). She was sick before that, at home, and she finally had to call # to come and get her. She believes she had to call # the 5th day before Easter, but she was not positive. When asked to clarify what she meant by sick, the patient explained she was extremely tired, she couldn&#39;t get out of bed and couldn&#39;t move. She was having trouble breathing. She was on oxygen 24/7 and sleeps with a trilogy machine so she was having a lot of trouble, it was awful. She said she then found out at the hospital her red blood cell was below 5 and her iron was critically low. They had to give her 2 units of blood and an infusion. Then she went back yesterday and got another infusion and she has to go back next week for another infusion. The patient confirmed that she was hospitalized for COPD. She then stated she didn&#39;t know the exact date of when she was discharged from the hospital, but she was thinking it was the day she was scheduled for her second shot. She then clarified she came home Easter. The patient reported that she can&#39;t do much without having to sit down, catch her breath, and rest a little bit. She was improving but not as fast as she&#39;d like to. While reading the vaccine record card, the patient stated &#34;my eyes aren&#39;t as good as they used to be&#34;. Her pulmonologist stated she was going to die if she doesn&#39;t take the vaccine. If she catches COVID she was not going to make it, so her pulmonologist thinks her chances are better with the vaccine than without it. The patient said she goes all the time to the hospital; therefore, she doesn&#39;t think the events were related to the vaccine. She had been sick several times. They can&#39;t do anything about the bleeding, they can&#39;t go in to do anything because of her lungs, her lungs were so bad. No further details were provided regarding the bleeding she was speaking of. The patient reported that duloxetine doesn&#39;t come as 90 mg so she takes a 30 mg and 60 mg tablet; she mixes the Brovana and Budesoind and takes them at the same time, twice a day. She was given an albuterol solution, 0.5mg PRN (as needed), for her emphysema/COPD. She says she just started taking this from her last hospital stay. The patient reported that she did not remember her iron count, just that it was critically low. She did remember asking the nurse what could happen, and the nurse said a lot of things such as infection. She confirmed tests were done in regards to the lung cancer. Her lungs were too critical for any kind of invasive tests. It was reported that the events Exacerbation of COPD and &#34;extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move&#34; were assessed by the patient as unrelated to BNT162B2. The outcome of the events &#34;Exacerbation of COPD/having trouble breathing&#34; and &#34; extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move/tiredness&#34; was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the narrative information provided, the reported events Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Fatigue, Asthenia, Blood iron decreased, Red blood cell count decreased and Asthenia are assessed as intercurrent medical conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.
