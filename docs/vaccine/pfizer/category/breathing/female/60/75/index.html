She was experiencing nose running, congested and blockage in her nose, and shortness of breath. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. For treatment, she took Mucinex tablets for allergy. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. This was the first dose, her second dose is due on 02Feb2020 and she wants to know if she can skip it.   Before she got it she contacted her primary care due to having allergies before the vaccine and asked if she should take; she was told to hold on but then she went ahead and took it. Within the first 30 minutes she was ok but in an hour is when she had the burning sensation in her chest. The burning sensation lasted about an hour. The dose was administered around 4pm on 12Jan2021.The caller reports that the Mucinex and she has breathing treatment, nebulizer treatments for her lungs, that she did and these things helped. Early this morning she felt she can now close her mouth and breathe normally. It was administered in the upper left arm. She did not require a visit to the doctor or ER. The patient has had no reactions to vaccines in the past nor were any administered on the day of or within the prior 4 weeks. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergy like symptoms, congested and blockage in her nose and shortness of breath which included Mucinex. The patient recovered from burning sensation in her chest on 12Jan2021, from allergy like symptoms/allergy and shortness of breath on 13Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The day of the vaccine there was no reaction. Day 2 I woke up with red angry lump at the injection site, about the size of a 0.50 cent piece.  Later that day I had a fever of 102.5 and chills. Day 3 the redness had spread and still had the lump.  Day 4 or 5 the color changed to purple and the lump had decreased.  It took about a week for the lump to go away.  I still have a discoloration on my arm where the vaccine was given.  It looks a bruise but no pain.  The whole time the area blanched well.  The first dose I had on my left arm and the next day I had a small welt with redness.  I am on my second round of steroids to try and get my asthma under control and had to increase my Advair to the highest dose.  My doctor put me on a antibiotic as well with the second round of steroids.  My asthma is a little better but not at my baseline.

                                                Being a diabetic, my blood sugar was in the 300&#39;s, and even after changing my insulin pump because I believed there may have been an issue with delivery, my blood sugar continued to rise.  I did not eat anything until about 6 PM when my blood sugar began to lower.  At that time, I tried to eat some chicken soup, but after a few mouthfuls, my throat began to constrict and my tongue and the inside of my mouth began to itch.  This continued every time I began to try to eat something and I still could feel what felt like some constriction in the back of my throat the next day (Monday).

                                                On  the day of the shot, by Noon I could feel the vaccine moving into my throat and my  face. My throat and left cheek started to swell and turn slightly red.  I took more Benadryl and called my allergist in the afternoon. They told me I needed to get to the hospital for treatment.  At the hospital, they gave me steriods, benadryl and Pepcid in an IV.  After allowing this to work, they sent me home with a  steriod prescription for 60Mg for the next 5 days.  They asked me to follow up with my allergist if I had other issues , they also told me that I would not be able to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Over the next several days, I continued to have issues with this redness that had grown over my entire face. I looked like I was totally sunburned.  I did not feel well, the redness was very hot, and I struggled with some breathing. I made an appointment on  Monday morning with my allergist, and they adjusted my allergy medicine and gave me more asteroids for 5 more days.   They advised me to use my nebulizer treatments as needed to remove the heaviness in my chest. This redness and swelling has moved around my body, almost as if I can see where the vaccine is at in my body.  It went from my head to my chest/back and right arm. Down to my abdomen, and then down below my knees.  In the morning, it is usually in my face and then it moves around during the day.  I can feel this fluid moving around in my body because the redness brings swelling/fluid.  This last saturday 3/6/2021 was horrible, it was in my right ear and right foot.  It was very painful and made me very dizzy. I struggled to walk.  Then on Sunday morning, I felt fine all day.  Today Monday, it feels like it is in my right foot again, but I feel like It is  getting better.

                                                This is a 60-year-old female who just received her second Pfizer dose of the Covid vaccine earlier today when she says she felt immediately a flushing of her left arm where she had received the vaccination and then some tingling and abruptly followed with difficulty swallowing tongue enlargement, and feeling like she had to &#34;search for my air&#34;. This required her to turn her head leftward to assist in her breathing. She has no associated pruritus. She was given an intramuscular injection of epinephrine at the clinic where she received the vaccination and EMS was activated. She did not demonstrate any changes in her phonation or signs of stridor and there was no wheezing or signs of facial or oral swelling on arrival of paramedics. She received additional intramuscular injection of epinephrine and IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol at that time followed by an albuterol inhalation treatment and transported here as a medical alert. She reports the symptoms are similar to what she is experienced with multiple bee sting allergic reactions in the past. She is never required intubation. She never develops any facial swelling or urticaria.

There was a small area of linear opacity near the right lung base. This could be related to atelectasis or acute infection. The remainder of the lungs clear, no pleural effusions. Heart size not enlarged. Normal contour of the mediastinum. No acute osseous findings.

This lasted about a minute. I just sat there since I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal. I started to feel like my heart was going back to normal so I just sat there for the specified 15 minutes. After I left and was driving home, I stated to feel a shortness of breath and difficulty getting air. I also felt like a hard to swallow. I was about 1 mile from venue so this happened with 30 minutes of receiving the shot. This only lasted what seemed like a short time and then I started to feel like I could get my breath. By the time I returned home I was breathing ok but my lips were a little tingly. I felt fine by 5:00 pm.

Couldn&#39;t talk due to chills without extreme stuttering.  Ended up being transported to a local ER for care where I remained for approximately 7 hours.  Was given IV fluids and Toporol to control fever.  Fever persisted for 72 hours, loss of appetite and extreme fatigue.  Now 7-days post 2nd shot and still experiencing fatigue.

                                                A few days after the vaccine on that Wednesday I began having pain in the upper shoulder and back area which persisted to a heaviness in my chest going into Thursday.   Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

                                                As I pulled up for the 15 minute wait period the symptoms started 5 minutes after I received my vaccine.  A tingling feeling up my left arm to back of my neck. My neck stiffened and then my throat started to close.  Not to where I can&#39;t swallow but just like when I eat food that I&#39;m allergic too, it closes up. The nurse that was overseeing me was holding the umbrella over my car window with the rainfall.  All of a sudden their was lightning &amp; thunder. The nurse threw the umbrella because she was shocked from the lightning. She started to talk to all the other around her and forgot about me. Since I could still swallow I didn&#39;t get her attention. When she returned she asked me the time so I had to pull my phone out. She didn&#39;t know the time of my 15 minutes and sent me away. As soon as I got out of the parking area but still inside amusement park, I started to feel my cheeks becoming numb and my right eye was blurry.  I quickly moved over to the side lane still inside of amusement park and waited.  I called my husband and told him that with the heavy rain I didn&#39;t feel safe driving with my right eye being blurry.  I waiting another 15 minutes before driving home.  That evening the blurriness came back, my eye&#39;s &amp; forehead was tender to touch but no headache.  Only pressure in my head.  My symptoms of closed throat, swollen cheeks, pressure in my head and blurriness continued on Friday, March 12th, Saturday, March 13th, Sunday, March 14th and Monday, March 15th.  As of today, no other systems other than feeling my body has inflammation.

Pain to the back of my neck, a flush of warmth to my upper body and difficulty breathing.  Felt like a truck ran over my chest.  I was weak, dizzy and nauseous as well.  The tingling sensation also affected both my legs. The RN took to their infirmary area and began taking my vitals.  Vitals seems normal, Blood Pressure and Pulse were high.  I am asthmatic but did not bring my inhaler with me.  Because of my difficulty breathing, they decided to inject me with Benadryl which is all they had.  After about twenty minutes, my breathing started to calm down and blood pressure began coming down as well.

Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

She had extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, upper back pain and even a bloody nose on 10Apr2021 and also she couldn&#39;t see out of her left eye for about 2 hours. Then on 11Apr2021, she had severe pain at the back of her neck with a headache that lasted about 20 minutes and she couldn&#39;t move her neck. She had diarrhea and the only temperature she had was on 12Apr2021, it was only 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn&#39;t bad, but she had really bad diarrhea on 12Apr2021 and she took Imodium. She had a headache and slight breathing difficulties and things like that. On 13Apr2021 she had a headache, was really weak, had leg aches, fatigue that was really bad and she couldn&#39;t stay awake and her temperature that day was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit which is normal. Then yesterday, 15Apr2021, she thought she was over all the things and that she was feeling better from the fatigue, nausea (occurred on an unspecified date), lightheadedness but she couldn&#39;t sleep again. She didn&#39;t sleep since Wednesday morning until last night finally and she only slept for an hour since Wednesday morning. She woke up on 15Apr2021 and had no symptoms except her left and her right hips, both, had severe pain and she could barely walk and she couldn&#39;t bend at all. All she could do it take Tylenol and she used a heating pad and the pain was excruciating. She went to bed last night and she did sleep for maybe a total of 2 hours and when she woke up this morning her left hip seemed to be a little better but her right hip is still in severe pain and now her right knee joint is in severe pain too. Other than that, she has no other symptoms just the joint pain. She didn&#39;t know it would go on for this long, it has been over a week now and she just wanted to let us know about this. The patient was hospitalized for the event anaphylactic reaction from 08Apr2021 to 08Apr2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Blood typing: anti kell antibodies (doctor randomly decided to do a blood typing and they found anti kell antibodies in her blood) on an unspecified date, temperature: 99.5 degrees fahrenheit on 12Apr2021, temperature: 98.7 degrees fahrenheit on 13Apr2021.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: EW0ISO) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included she had lupus, sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications not reported. The patient previously took Pneumonia Vaccine on 04Mar2021 (Anatomical Location: Left arm); took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: the lot number starts with ER something and then it ends with a 3) as single dose for covid-19 immunization; took azathioprine for lupus and had allergic reaction; took belimumab (BENLYSTA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Lot Number: PV7G; Expiration Date: Jun2023, NDC: 49401-088-01, Number on the side: 0147098) to an unspecified date, self injection once a week for lupus. She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn&#39;t super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn&#39;t done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn&#39;t stop and she told herself that if it didn&#39;t stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn&#39;t been eating a lot so she hasn&#39;t had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn&#39;t swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can&#39;t recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn&#39;t even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn&#39;t help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren&#39;s disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous&#34; was recovered on 17Apr2021. The outcome of events &#34;Feeling of warmth, Vaccination site pain, Hyperaesthesia, Vaccination site erythema, Tiredness&#34; not recovered. The outcome of the event &#34;Headache&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                congestion in the throat and upper lungs; congestion in the throat and upper lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on the left arm on 21Dec2020 09:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included herpes 2. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 26Dec2020 09:00, the patient experienced congestion in the throat and upper lungs. Oxygen level was 98 and temperature was 97.7. She had a good diet, no dairy, and no Christmas junk food, so for the patient, it was inexplicable. She was also consistent at mask wearing and all the precautions. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal gap between the vaccination and the event onset, the Company considers the event pulmonary congestion is unlikely related to vaccination with BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I awoke at 11 pm to use the restroom and when I returned to bed I had a cough and SOB. This continued with copious secretions with worsening over time until I was fighting for air at 4:30 am. My husband called the ambulance because he did not feel he could get me to the hospital in time. In the ambulance I was started on 4L of O2. Upon arrival at the ER I was given a breathing treatment and started on the BiPap. I was admitted to the hospital and received 3 more breathing treatments and recovered to be on room air by 11:00 pm. The tests and observations, the doctor reported that there was no other cause than the vaccine.

Didn&#39;t notice until I left the vaccine site and was on the way home in car because covered by mask. Note I am a very fair skin, freckled red haired woman. I was very, very nervous and had gotten myself to the point of tears. Perhaps the flushing was from that. Have had similar flushing when drinking red wine.  Swelling in lymph node in supraclavicular area on same side as shot. Has happened with Flu shot once. Slight fever for a short period of time and fatigue. I continue to have slight shortness of breath from having covid on. 4/3/20. Nothing different.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

                                                I am retired handicap-MS.  I was doing light housework.  I started getting pain in right lung,  over course of 2  hours  pain became very severe.  Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

I was sitting in my living room watching TV and a sudden severe pain shot through my chest and followed by tightness and difficulty breathing. It was immediately accompanied by a pain between the shoulder blades, cold sweat, nausea, then neck pain and faintness along with the uncontrollable need to move my bowels which was in diarrhea form and continued 3 times within 20 minutes with the other symptoms. After about 5 minutes of receiving the onset of the initial shocking pain, the intensity of the chest pain left but the tightness remained and faded but would return and then subside again every 10 minutes.  I went to the emergency room at 11:20pm discharged at 2:50am on 3/19/21.

It has been 12 hours since the injection and my face still feels numb, but swallowing is just starting to get a little easier. The numbness is mostly around my nose, cheeks and forehead.

                                                Patient reported to nurse after receiving first dose of Pfizer that 3-5 minutes later her left side of neck/throat felt tight and tingled. Nurse alerted Doctor and myself to assist patient. We arrived to patient&#39;s car in front of garage at 10:55 AM and walked beside car as the husband pulled forward to park. Patient stated she received her vaccine about 10:45 and then as her husband started pulling forward, she told him about her symptoms. Dr. assessed patient and stayed with patient until 11:13AM. Patient left in passenger seat with her husband driving stating that she no longer felt the tightness in her neck or throat.

                                                Immediately: headache, left eye pain, nausea, cold sensation and felt ?weird? but thought it was normal and thought I might feel flying for a bit but that it would wear off so I did not report feeling anything at the clinic. I left the clinic and got in the car to drive home and felt a weird feeling in my throat reminiscent of my esophageal spasm and then it felt like someone had their hand on my throat squeezing my throat and felt like I needed to take deep breaths to expand my lungs. Within a minute or two at most, my lips, tip of my tongue, tip of my nose and face beside my lips and under my cheeks started to tingle and go numb.  My insides felt swollen.   I had a doctors appointment and went there after picking my son up at home.  I reported my feeling to my doctor who prescribed a steroid for 3 days and told me to also take Benadryl or Claritin, which I did. However, today is day 4 after my vaccine and today is the first day my insides don?t hurt.

                                                About 50 minutes after the vaccine was given, my tongue began to swell and I experienced tightness in my throat and chest and shortness of breath. (This was occurring while I was driving myself home from the vaccination site.)  I administered my Epipen.  And I then drove myself to the Emergency Room, which is near my home.  At the ER, I was injected with cortisone, Benadryl, and Pepcid, and had my heart and blood pressure monitored for about 3 hours and then I was released, with a prescription for 50MG Prednisone (1q/day) and 10MG Pepcid (2q/day) x 5 days (for both scripts).  I finished the prescriptions, but am still feeling some discomfort in my throat and some dizziness.

Went to the emergency room and was stable at the time. Toward the latter part of the ER visit, I was given prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl. Have had no issues since then.

                                                Between 10 and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt like someone had thumped me in the chest over my left breast. I tried to breathe deeply, and I started to feel light headed. I didn&#39;t tell anyone, I was let go after 15 minutes. I sat in my car about 5 minutes and then decided I was worse. I was weak and shaky and light headed, my top lip was fuzzy feeling. I didn&#39;t feel like there was a blockage in my airway but I felt like I was having trouble getting my rib cage to expand so I could breathe. I went back in and was sat down, I was evaluated. Paramedics were called, by time they came I was lightheaded and I was foggy brained. I couldn&#39;t respond easily. My BP was 165/99 and my heart rate was 98. my O2 was fine but by that time I felt like I had to work hard to get a deep breath. I was feeling worse quickly. I was taken to the ER in a wheelchair. I was put in a bed and hooked me up to monitors. I was left alone for a while. When the dr came in he checked me out and listen to my lungs. I had a hard time getting my lungs to expand. Doctor ordered a blood sugar test and it was below 100. Chest x-ray, EKG and blood work. He told me later that everything was normal. I was there for 2 hours before I felt like I could go home. I didn&#39;t receive any medication. I was able to breathe easier by time I left the hospital. I was thinking more clearly as well. The next day I was still feeling shaky and weak. I went to my PCP on friday and I was feeling normal by then.

                                                at 3am I woke up with a racing heart rate and mild burning in my belly. I couldnt go back to sleep. The next day the burning in the belly got worse. My stomach became bloated and I was having shortness of breath walking short distances. The racing heart and chest pain ebbed and flowed.  I made a video appointment with my PCP group  on Thursday and they prescribed omeprazole and asked me to come in for physical exam the next day. When I went in the symptoms persisted, they did blood work, did a chest x-ray and sent me over to the emergency room. At the ER they did an EKG, more blood tests and recommended I have a abdominal CT on an outpatient basis. They couldnt say my symptoms were a result of the Pfizer shot but they could not rule it out that it was related to the shot.

After she received her vaccine she felt fine. On Tuesday night she started to feel some itchiness. She said the itchiness got worse over the next two days. She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

I also began having problems breathing, began coughing and choking, chest pain, and dizziness.  The nursing staff at Hospital immediately got a wheelchair and rushed me next door to the ER.  The nurses had called ahead so that the ER doctors were ready to assist me.  I was given Epinephrine, steroids, nubilizer treatments, Bendryl, IV fluids and oxygen.  After some time I began feeling a little better but then the reaction restarted and treatments had to be re-administered several times.  It was quite frightening.  I also had a severe headache and tightness of the chest .  The ER doctor believed that I should be admitted which was done on 4/2/21 and was kept thru 4/4/21.

                                                severe allergic reaction to the vaccine; sore arm; neck pain; getting lots of saliva; tongue started swelling; rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing; heart rate it got faster; started getting confused; shaky; wheezing; swelling of her throat; blood pressure dropped; This is a spontaneous report form a contactable consumer reporting for herself.  A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 61-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Asthma, HBP, High Cholesterol, prediabetes. Known allergies: Penicillin, Sulfa, Peanuts. Concomitant medication(s) included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atenolol, chlortalidone (ATENOLOL/CHLORTHALIDONE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; metformin (METFORMIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; sertraline hydrochloride (SERTRAL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. No covid tested post vaccination. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reactions, tired, earache, swelling, itching, stinging, peeling, hurt my, throat was swelling, couldn&#39;t sleep, rash, burning, the neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse. It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (BNT162B2) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: TW0151) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer, pneumonia, pain in her lungs, smoker and arthritis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced what scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen on an unspecified date, problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored on 11Apr2021, arm hurt on 09Apr2021, pain in her back where her lungs are on 11Apr2021, hot and cold sweats on 10Apr2021, dizzy on 10Apr2021, shaky on 10Apr2021, nausea on 13Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders on 11Apr2021, out of it on 11Apr2021, weak on 10Apr2021, tired on 10Apr2021, headache on 10Apr2021, anxious on 10Apr2021, fever on 10Apr2021, itchy on 09Apr2021, feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen on an unspecified date, the pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs on an unspecified date, she has been sick on an unspecified date, her mental status was also affected on an unspecified date. Patient had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine on 09Apr2021 and gradually her arm hurt, she had hot sweats, she felt dizzy, was shaky, had nausea, and had body pain. The one thing she is concerned about was she had pain in her back where her lungs are and she was having problems breathing. She has a little bit of that still. She has also been out of it. Her breathing still almost feels labored, and this past weekend she thought she would go to the emergency room. Her main concern is this awful pain in her back while she was having problems breathing and getting enough oxygen. She felt weak, dizzy, and shaky. She got scared. She has been sick, she had cancer a long time ago. What scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen. The pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs. It goes directly from the front to the back. On Monday it started feeling better. Today it is so much better. She will feel like she is not getting enough oxygen or giving a full breath and then this in her back. She remembers having pneumonia years ago and having pain in her lungs. That&#39;s why she knows the pain is in the back of her lungs. She has to say she is a smoker. She slowed down and couldn&#39;t smoke this week or during that. She kind of quit, that&#39;s her reality now. The pain comes and goes throughout the day but it is not as bad. She didn&#39;t have this shortness of breath and other things until a couple days after she got the vaccine. It gradually came up on her. She was not having trouble breathing, it was more slightly labored. It was not profound, just there. Sometimes when she is speaking after a while she gets tired and will have to take a moment and take a deep breath. It is so much better. She called her primary care physician and was anxious, and all he said was she would feel effects for 2 weeks. He wasn&#39;t very helpful. Her arm hurt the day that she had the shot. Even today there are little bits of pain but very light. 09Apr2021 through 11Apr2021 was when everything really hit. It was hard to lift up her arm. It was a little pain, it was no big deal. She would have the AC on and blast it when she had the hot and cold sweats. She was using napkins because she was sweating profusely. It felt like she obviously had a reaction to the vaccine. It&#39;s normal she guesses. She didn&#39;t expect it for the first dose. The 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th it was really bad. Her whole body was sweating and would get wet. She&#39;d be hot and then cold. She was anxious because she was having problems breathing. She still gets a little bit of hot and cold sweats, but nothing compared to what she went through. As the days go on she is slowly getting better. She was dizzy not just during the day, at night she couldn&#39;t sleep because of it. She has gradually gotten better. Yesterday she tried to do some gardening but felt so weak she had to come back inside. When she gets up she feels weak and a little bit of lack of air. She has labored breathing. She was real itchy. The shakiness, dizziness, and anxiety all came on and were horrible. She doesn&#39;t know if the nausea was because she couldn&#39;t eat and had to take her regular medication. It was very light nausea. She had flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders. Her headache was major too during all of this. The headache is something that comes and goes still. It is a weird kind of headache. She had a fever and got like flu all over body pain. She doesn&#39;t know how to explain how she felt out of it. She doesn&#39;t know if it was the fact she was so sick. She had a feeling of did she do that. She couldn&#39;t make decisions. She would need to take the garbage out and go back to the garbage and think what did she come here for. Her mental status was also affected. The weakness gradually got really bad, and she still hasn&#39;t recovered from it. She still feels weak and tired when trying to do things. She was tired the day after she got the vaccine. The first day she thought it was nothing and she was fine. Gradually it got real bad when she was sick. She didn&#39;t feel that flu-ish feeling but was weak and tired. She got dizzy and she had the brain fog thing. She was having really bad headaches during the same time. The weakness and tiredness go hand in hand. She takes a mineral for her thoracic spine, but she takes that more for elderly arthritis. She doesn&#39;t have any conditions that she thinks played a role. She has been feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen. Took Tylenol for her fever. Mentioned fever would go away and come back. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 102, 99 and 100.1 (unit unspecified) all on unspecified dates.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever and itchy. Outcome of the event problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored, arm hurt, pain in her back where her lungs are, hot and cold sweats, dizzy, out of it and headache was recovering. Outcome of the event fever was recovered on 13Apr2021, itchy was recovered with sequelae on 14Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders was recovered on 16Apr2021, nausea was recovered on 16Apr2021, shaky was recovered on 19Apr2021. Outcome of the event weak and tired was not recovered. Outcome of all the other events was unknown.

                                                By 12:50 hands were starting to swell; chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard; non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia; non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia; blood pressure was up; throat felt like it was starting to tighten; eyes itchy; eyes itching much worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 22Apr2021 12:10 (at the age of 61-year-old) as unknown single for COVID-19 immunization. This report was not related to a study or programme. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was first time had flu shot made her very ill, next year doctor suggested she should just have half of a shot instead of full shot to see if she tolerated it and she was able to tolerate that. She had not any other problems with flu vaccines in general. Some of the other vaccines, she was just supposed to take Benadryl with them because of some of the filler ingredients people put in things. She had previously had the 1 dose shingles vaccine, but she had gotten probably shingles probably a couple of months after that so they encouraged her to get the 2 part shingles vaccine at a later date and told her to do the pre-medicate routine like Benadryl day before, day of and at least 2 days after shingles vaccine doses and if any major problems call for help. She did not have a noticeable problem from the 2 part shingles vaccine. Some of the times depends on what filler ingredients people use. She was allergic to nutmeg which was used as an emollient oil or it&#39;s called Myristicin something or other oil; if something has too high a dose of mannitol it can cause a problem. She has a very long list of allergies and high sensitivities; if it was a high enough sensitivity it goes in allergies list, even though it may not be a true allergy. Family has lots of allergies. Regarding prescribed indication additional details: She had 3 doctors who initially advised her to get the vaccine including her primary care physician, oncologist and haematologist; this was because she was a high risk person because of various health issues. Her haematologist 2-3 months ago when she had her last appointment with him he was saying to get the shot and prescribed the epi-pen at that time; no one was having it yet, but he expected she would have some sort of reaction to it not able to be covered by Benadryl alone. Medical history included ongoing platelet disorder Verbatim: Unidentified platelet disorder, Lots of allergies, cardiac murmur, ongoing asthma, osteoarthritis, glucose tolerance impaired, hypoglycaemia slow thyroid and back and neck pain. Concomitant medication(s) included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for hypersensitivity (50mg taken as needed), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for hypersensitivity (10mg daily), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma (250/50 twice daily), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism (137mcg-1 tablet daily), methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) (20mg tablet twice daily), salsalate, colestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT) (2-500mg tablets 3 times daily), sucralfate (CARAFATE) (1mg tablet 4 times daily-dosage verified with caller as milligrams and captured as provided), loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]) (2.5/0.25 takes 2 tablets of that 4 times daily), calcium carbonate (CALCIUM OYSTER SHELL [CALCIUM CARBONATE]) (Alternates dose of 500mg and 1000mg on days takes Vitamin D), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) (250 mg), vitamin D (50,000 units every other day taken), vitamin B12 (1mg injection every 14 days), clonazepam (KLONOPIN) (2-1mg tablets at bedtime), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma (10mg tablets at bedtime) and cefixime (FLEXERIL [CEFIXIME]) taken for back pain, neck pain (10mg tablets 3 times daily as needed). On 22Apr2021, Onset time: She had a note saying her eyes itchy at 12:20, but they were itching before that because she waited long enough to report it; so onset time was less than 10 minutes when her eyes started itching. Then her pulse; she could feel chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard. They did check her pulse while she was in their initial observation and her pulse was only in the 70s, but oxygenation was at 96%.When at doctors office less than 1 hour before that reading, oxygenation was at 98%.Recorded at 12:30 eyes itching much worse, throat felt like it was starting to tighten, heart felt like it was starting to race. By 12:50 hands were starting to swell. She had already been pre-medicated with Benadryl before this before she went down to get the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, she had Benadryl in her system. She had that same morning with her morning meds had taken Zyrtec and Benadryl in anticipation of getting the possibility of getting the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine because she has to pre-medicate for vaccines just in case she starts to react in anyway. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines was not administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Emergency Room taken from the location where vaccine administered-they gave her Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot had her sit for basic observation then sit for extended observation. In that time period telling them her symptoms were going on, increasing. They gave her another 50mg Benadryl even though she had already had 1 before and then called emergency room, took her down, left her in waiting area even though she had heart and chest palpitations. Physician Office seen prior to event on 20Apr2021, seen after event 27Apr2021. Primary Care Physician didn&#39;t hear anything in lungs either visit. Not admitted to hospital; seen in emergency room, theoretically she got treated; however her basic blood pressure and stuff even with what they were doing was higher than when she was triaged in the ER; blood pressure was up and something else,oxygenation level moderately reduced from when she came down to when she was just let go; however her symptoms were worse when she was leaving than when she got there. She knows what they gave her while she was there was IV of normal saline, solumedrol and IV Benadryl. Thinks they later gave her Tylenol tablets. Finally got them to do an EKG because kept saying her chest was getting worse but that was several hours after she was back there even though came there having chest pains. In her opinion this hospital was not taking reaction seriously. Not admitted to hospital even though symptoms were worse and blood pressure higher on discharge, well above her normal levels. Currently trying to get them to explain why they took so long to do anything for her. Finally did a chest x-ray on 22Apr2021:discharge papers say abnormal x-ray and they gave a couple of different possibilities as to what that might be so Primary Care Physician wrote a prescription to get a follow-up chest x-ray to make sure that everything is fine and back to normal and not ongoing or progressing or anything because they gave some strange things: what their impressions were: findings: there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. It says the left lung appears clear; cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits; impression restates non specific right findings there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. This was from front and lateral views of the chest x-ray at 19:00pm 22Apr2021. 2 ECGs: She guesses this is what they call EKG not, relevant point is that in the notes there for the records: Says abnormal ECG compared with blah blah blah, hard to find when exactly they wrote this, trying to get the exact wording for each of the two. Machine results CED, which caller explained is what they call themselves now instead of ER, notes for MD interpretation; one done at 17:53 , other at 21:32. They both say there was slightly different readings, however both say abnormal ECG. One of the wordings that is in both. She had no further details to provide regarding relevant testing/investigations. She had to be in the ER back in the room for several hours before they would do the EKG and that&#39;s only because she said I have chest pain and standard procedure is to do an EKG, had been back there for hours, they had done no tests, the only thing they did was basic blood panel, had not done a troponin or heart enzymes test, had not done EKG that&#39;s why she knows they were not taking her seriously at all; if someone says chest pains and you don&#39;t do anything in the standard protocol they are not taking you seriously. On this Monday, 2 days ago she had gone down to pick up the records from the ER to go to Primary Care Physician appointment 27Apr2021, finally actually got to speak to someone who said they would get back to her on 27Apr2021 to look into why the EKG tests were not done for someone having chest pains. That&#39;s one of the first things you do for someone having chest pain, no matter what the source. Frustrated with them because they&#39;re still not communicating back, they had not taken her seriously while she was there; unknown if they were actually going to be reporting, as they were still trying to convince her to get the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. If she reacted to the first dose in first 10 minutes, second dose could be much more of a reaction. With the amount of anti-histamines in her system with Benadryl and Zyrtec and she was still starting to react in under 10 minutes. It&#39;s possible to be one of the inactive ingredients but she doesn&#39;t see anything in the pamphlet provided that she could identify at first glance as being the culprit to the problem other than 2 possibilities: potassium chloride and other is monobasic potassium phosphate. There is a possibility of her having a reaction to those because she was known to react to certain potassium products; sometimes it was the inactive ingredients. She definitely would have wanted to get the second part of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine series until after she was not getting the medical attention she needed after reaction to the first dose. Because ideally you&#39;re supposed to have it at the same location, that just made her very nervous at the prospect of worse reaction at location that did not take her serious the first time. She was a big fan of Pfizer thought they do a great job; she had not known it was a 2 parter, not that it should make much difference. When her Primary Care Physician was saying second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was out of the question and she had been saying to people that she did not think it would be prudent to take the second part, they kept trying to say oh you need to get the second part, talk to so and so so they can convince you to get it, and doctor is going no. She reacted to ringers lactate or lactated ringers whatever the name is, her retired nurse sister sat and watched her getting some ringers lactate prior to surgery for her tear duct and saw her starting to break out in red splotches, patient said she was itching. Action taken in response to the events was drug withdrawn. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The next day I still wasn&#39;t feeling well and I was called in to get covid tested and I went to the ER on the 21st and took a rapid covid test that was positive. I was stable and had good oxygenation and was discharged. I have fever nausea vomiting  I also had problems with O2 stat i was in the 80s and realized I was having respiratory failure so I was admitted on the 27th and I&#39;ve been here ever since. I had kinetic storm and infusions my O2 stats were bad and I was sent to the covid unit and put on high flow oxygen and negative for a PE, I&#39;m still on the covid unit but I feel much better today

                                                Pfizer-BioTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 24 hrs post vaccination I started feeling fatigued, muscle and headaches which seemed to move around my body for about 24 hrs. At one point it seemed to settle into my hand. Knuckles swelled arthritis like. When walking up stairs I had significant muscle weakness in my legs and exertional  dyspnea.  Eyes felt &#34;feverish&#34; but had no fever. The next morning while trying to do a routine workout the same thing happened. It was a significant change to my normal condition. The dyspnea was the most concerning. The body aches settled into my lower back. Fatigue was moderate-moderately severe.  As the day went on things waxed and waned.  By the end of 72 hrs. most symptoms subsided. Friday 01/08/2021 I had a completely normal workout, no exertional  dyspnea, fatigue subsided, no body aches. Back to normal. I would consider the symptoms to have been  Moderate&#43;.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

                                                On 1/8/2021 2 days after I received the Covid vaccine I started to have SOB and coughing. I started to used my inhalers and it would give some relief but I was using it more than normal. I had not had asthma attack for more than a year. My asthma is very controlled that I don&#39;t use any inhalers whether daily or as needed. I went to work as usual since at that time my symptoms weren&#39;t getting worse but also not getting better. On 1/19/21, I was feeling more out of breath and having more dry hacking cough that when I called EH I was told to do the Covid testing. That same day I called my Asthma doctor and did a video call and was prescribed Breo inhaler, spiriva inhaler, xoponex nebulizer treatment and xoponex rescue inhaler. I couldn&#39;t go to work because of my shortness of breath and coughing. The treatment didn&#39;t work. On Tuesday 1/26/21, I called my asthma doctor again and another video call was made. She changed my inhaler to symbicort, still continue spirirva inhaler and nebulizer treatment. I also contacted my primary doctor who asked that I schedule an appointment with him so he can see me. On 1/28/21, I saw my primary doctor who did blood works to see if I have any blood clot and to see how my heart was doing. I was given phenergan with codeine to help with my coughing and it did help me to go to sleep. My blood works came out negative and he ordered CAT scan of my chest since I can&#39;t get rid of my SOB and coughing. I had the CAT scan on 2/3/21. He called me the next day and I was told that I had mucous plugging. He told me to go home and he prescribed Duoneb nebulizer treatment 4x a day and spiriva inhalers 2x a day. I started to get rid of the mucous that I had and started to breath better. It took 4 days of 4x a day nebulizer treatment and inhalers before I started to feel

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

I remember someone telling me to sit down and eat something.  (I had already had lunch and a snack).  That evening I started to have a bad headache. Thursday morning I had a very difficult time getting up and was extremely fatigued; felt hot. I felt exhausted all day and looked pretty tired and pale. Friday morning still tired, had some bouts of energy, but they didn&#39;t last long. Body aches were worse and I also had some stomach discomfort Saturday felt like I had a sore throat, felt weak, and still pretty tired.  I had some problems catching my breath when climbing stair and  and at one point felt hot and clammy.  Headache was better.

                                                Patient has allergies to several medications and keeps epipen on hand with her always. Was asked to sit for 30  minutes after vaccine. At minute 27 she started getting swelling and redness of her lips and face slightly. She normally takes Benadryl when this happens so gave her a Benadryl 50mg one dose. Her throat then became tight in a few minutes and she said that she needed an epipen because she was starting to have a little bit of trouble breathing. Gave epipen and her symptoms resolved within a few minutes. Kept her for 15 minutes. She stated that she knew she would be ok and asked if she could leave. I stated she needed to see the ER if she had any more trouble. I also consulted with her to check with her doctor about getting the 2nd dose because more than likely it&#39;s not recommended.

I still have some chest heaviness and still having asthma issues which includes coughing.  I also had side effects of sore arm, chills, fatigue.  Did not seek treatment.  I had no idea how long this would last.  I wish I would have read the paperwork for severe allergic reaction, but I didn&#39;t. I would have gone to the ER.  I have suffered with this since Saturday.

Very tired . Tired enough that I accidentally  left the house for a job interview wearing one white sock and one black sock. Which isn&#39;t normal for me. 3rd day: muscle aches. 4th days feels like a really mild virus.   This is not me but another person from  my former job said she had spontaneous canker sores from the Pfizer shot.

                                                Shortly after 1st dose Pfizer vaccine given patient complaint of &#34;throat swelling&#34; without difficulty swallowing or breathing. Given 5o mg of diphenhydramine and albuterol inhaler, then transferred to ED.  Per ED note: &#34;Her main complaint to me was feeling of swelling in her throat. I do not see objective evidence of this on exam, she is not in respiratory distress, thus epinephrine was held. She was given IV methylprednisolone and famotidine, already received benadryl. After about 10 minutes she started to feel better and her symptoms resolved in ED. Tryptase and C4 sent per protocol (within normal limits). She was observed for 5 hours with no recurrence of symptoms and was discharged with a prednisone burst x 4 days. I recommended she take benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 24 hours and then as needed after. She already has an epi pen.&#34;

I tried to take 2 puffs of my ProAir inhaler, this did nothing to help the SOB. Within the hour I could not get a full breath at all. the chest pain was only tolerable if I was leaning forward. My husband took me to the ER. They did testing and found that I had Pericarditis and Pleuritis. They informed me that I should NOT get any further COVID vaccines because it could kill me.

A 62-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration administered on right arm on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 62-year-old) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Allergies with This was under control, ongoing asthma with This was under control, meniere&#39;s disease from 1989 and ongoing with This was under control, have 2 broken knees. Patient knows how to control this condition, she didn&#39;t need Prednisone prior to onset of these adverse events, Low immune system with She has an immune deficiency so her immune system very low, like 300., Respiratory illness, Genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, Endocrine abnormalities with endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. Family Medical History Relevant to AE reported as None.  History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect reported as Both doses of product documented in Pfizer Suspect Vaccine and Vaccination fields. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect reported as None. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207; Expiry date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration to the right arm on 13Mar2021 at 13:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine other than dose 1 of 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions patient reported none other than just her inhalers which doses of had to be increased in response to symptoms after first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Concomitant medication included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) taken as Dose increased to twice in the morning daily for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing, (Lot number: 0014678, ; Expiration Date: Jan20230); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) 500 taken as Dose increased from once daily to twice daily an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride (Lot Number: 3N2E, Expiration Date: Feb2022), fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing (Lot number: GA00510, Expiration date: May2022); prednisone (PREDNISONE) taken for an unspecified indication with quantity of 27, Dose: 3-20mg daily for 7 days, then 2-20mg daily for 2 days, then 1-20mg daily for 3 days and Ongoing therapy. She also used a nose spray that didn&#39;t work so they switched her back to Dymista nose spray.   Consumer stated that she received both doses of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had reactions to both of them. Consumer stated that, &#34;The second dose was even worse. They put her on Prednisone. She did not know if she should be tested again or not? She was sitting up but she could not walk around anywhere. She had 2 broken knees. She could not walk anywhere. After the second dose, they had to bring her to the hospital because she couldn&#39;t even walk to her car. She got home and she had been sick ever since. She had allergies too. She could not do anything. she had a hard time breathing. she was hesitant to get the 2nd one, but everybody said to get it. Her IgG level was down to 300 something. She was also tapering off of prednisone and she did not want to be tapering off it because it was worked well for her. She could tell by her breathing that it was helped her. She could taste sodium in her mouth constantly since she had got the vaccination.&#34; Second dose completed her prescribed therapy. Dates for Symptoms From 15Mar2021 to Ongoing Reported seriousness for Symptoms reported as Unspecified and the Symptoms was reported as worsened. Patient&#39;s doctor dropped her last week, told her she didn&#39;t know what to do with her, and that this was too stressful.  Onset of symptoms following first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine was on 17Mar2021. She couldn&#39;t breathe very well when she went in for the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She was ok the first day after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, seemed ok, arm didn&#39;t hurt; but then had onset of symptoms. She has been in bed the whole time since onset of symptoms, was in bed for over 2 weeks. She slept for 2 days straight, only got up for water and the bathroom. It was bad, getting hard to breathe. She had to use her emergency inhaler. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine messed up her Meniere&#39;s disease. Doctor started patient on Prednisone for these symptoms, and Prednisone is really the only thing that clears up Meniere&#39;s disease because her ears was full and she could not get up. Prednisone helped her and I relayed in her &#39;rescue&#39; inhalers (treatment) because she did 2 in the morning, two inhalers anyway when she started to feel better, she got her second one and it made her worst.  She did not eat anything salty or anything, the barometric pressure was not bad. It was really funny because she had just finished everything and it was a few days before she had to go get her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine shot. She was just starting to feel normal, at least normal for her, she could get up normal and drive. They gave her the second shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and it was like a double. She clarified as she got like double the amount of symptoms that she had experienced following the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  She is tasting sodium in her mouth from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She can&#39;t have much sodium which struck up the Meniere&#39;s disease really bad the second day after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine; her allergies in her head went bonkers. She could not talk, it was closing up her throat, she was coughing every time she eats or dinks, and she&#39;s having a &#34;really bad&#34; adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the second dose. They had to take her out of the hospital to her car in a wheelchair &#34;right after&#34; getting the second shot. She could not get more than 1000 mg of sodium a day, she tastes it in her mouth constantly, she could not get rid of it and it was &#34;going through her system&#34;. She wanted to know what to do, since her doctor told her to contact Pfizer. She wanted to know what part of the vaccine is doing that, she assures it is sodium, because sodium is in her mouth 24/7 and she could not get it out, she could not have that much sodium in her body. It was still getting really hard to breathe. She is still taking the Prednisone she was initially prescribed and started on for the symptoms that started after her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She is tapering off of Prednisone, and she shouldn&#39;t be tapering off, she thinks she needs to be Prednisone for some more days, maybe 3 more days, then she would be ok. It was prescribed as a 7-day burst of Prednisone. She mentioned that the only Prednisone that works on her is the Actavis manufactured Prednisone; her pharmacy orders it for her because they know that. She called the emergency room Saturday when she was really bad. They said they had a line there and it was going to be at least a 4 hour wait.

Last night at roughly 3:15 am I woke up because I was having difficulties breathing. I had trouble on the inhale but the worse part was not being able to exhale with the CPAP on.  I could only exhale through the mouth. I had to take the CPAP off so as I could breath. I also got out of bed to get in a sitting position.  At this point my breathing seemed somewhat ok.  About 30 minutes later I took my blood pressure and pulse.  BP was 123 over 70 and my pulse was 70.

(Patient stated shortness of breath was another symptom that she had from COVID and is continuing somewhat especially when I was a mask for work -  but had not put it in the first report). Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

                                                No issues during 15 minute observation period after receiving the vaccine. So I left the facility to go to my car. Then about 15 minutes later my  face started to get really hot with  slight swelling. Then after several more minutes throat became tight and started to experience extreme  difficulty swallowing.   I was still in the parking lot so I immediately went back inside to the vaccination area asking for help.  I did not experience any breathing difficulties during the entire time but did experience extreme difficulty with swallowing and throat tightening.   The staff did the usual  checks. I was not too awarre of all the things they did but I was given a benedryl tablet which I was able to swallow thankfully. I was told my vitals were very high.  Not sure of exact times but sometime shortly after the benedryl things started to fell better.  The throat/swallowing started to get better.  Face burning started to cool.  Stayed in this area for about 20 or 30 more minutes and then told I could go with a comment that I should see my doctor about my high blood pressure.  Which I explained I do not have high blood pressure and when checked later in the day it was back to my usual 115 - 125 range .  I was concerned about getting the second shot later and was told to take a benedryl either just before I get the next shot or right after.??????   After checking the online cdc guidelines that does not jive at all.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

                                                When I first got it, I felt okay, but as I was walking out, I felt disoriented and had to sit down. I was very lightheaded and uneasy. I stayed about an hour because I was scared to drive. I later got chills and fever for about 24 hours.  I eventually developed shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, tightness in my throat, bruising in my legs and painful lymph nodes in my neck and arms. One day, I felt like I was having a mini-stroke. It only lasted for a brief period and then went away. That has occurred multiple times. My doctor thinks some of my issues were due to anxiety, but I don&#39;t agree because I&#39;m fine now.

                                                I started coughing for about an hour around 10pm while I was on a phone call;  then developed a fuzziness in my throat and felt like I had mucus in my chest. I took 120 mg  Allegra. I started to feel relief after about 10 minutes.  I had to relieve my throat of mucus this morning.  Other than muscular aches, especially at the site of the vaccine and behind my shoulder, I am ok. About 10 - 11 hours after my first vaccine on 2/26/2021, I developed a similar reaction, however much milder, and took Allegra, which relieved the symptoms.

Patient stated she had the first shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and today and last night the site was red, but today in that area she has gotten a big circle around it and its hard. Patient stated she&#39;s had it before with shots and just wanted to make, sometimes she has had to be put on medicine for it, wanted to be sure its healing because it does hurt her, right in that area where the shot was given. She also stated that after she has her second shot on 12Apr2021, she would like to talk to somebody and she would like to be able to have people in her home.

About the medical history, non-alcoholic liver disease: Stated diagnosed about eight years ago, she would say the same time, about 7 to 8 years ago because she had a virus and when she went in the hospital, the virus had attacked her right kidney and liver. She stated with non-alcoholic liver disease, she is overweight, and that causes her to have issues with her liver. The last few times her liver has been okay. Pre-Diabetic: They have been watching that for a while. Stated she gets edema, swelling in her legs, well, all the time. She has had this the last two years because she is pre-diabetic and a lot of overweight people have that. She also has varicose veins so that doesn&#39;t help. Stated that was given those to help break up, because she had pneumonia when she got the COVID and she had a little bit of pneumonia and had trouble breathing.

                                                has possible atrial fibrillation; Arm would get hurt; her arm felt like a bruise; irregular heart rates; She&#39;ll have  a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night.; When probing for specific event information she reports it&#39;s kind of like she coughs a little more and she is a little more short of breath and it&#39;s happening more often; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 63 years, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 04:06 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn&#39;t remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn&#39;t take any types of &#34;cillins&#34; medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she&#39;s noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn&#39;t feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it&#39;s going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she&#39;s not even doing anything. She hasn&#39;t even worked out yet. She doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. Medications don&#39;t work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She&#39;s been reporting online. Clarified she&#39;s reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She&#39;s been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband&#39;s cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She&#39;s also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband&#39;s heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn&#39;t messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she&#39;s standing completely still. Then she&#39;ll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she&#39;s been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it&#39;s going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she&#39;s never had her heartrate go down that far, it&#39;s really really weird. She thinks maybe she&#39;ll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s. Now the device says possible atrial fibrillation. It was further reported that she received the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm because she has bursitis in her right. If she hit her arm the second day after the Covid 19 vaccine, her arm would hurt. Her arm felt better the next day. She clarifies, on Sunday, 28Mar2021, she noticed her arm felt like a bruise and that was it. Then the next day on Monday, 29Mar2021, the feeling was gone. She didn&#39;t have any redness. The outcome of the events her arm felt like a bruise and arm would get hurt was recovered on 29Mar2021, irregular heart rates, dyspnea, cough was not recovered and unknown outcome for has possible atrial fibrillation.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Her lymph nodes in the neck were swollen, they hurt really bad, had pressure in the ears, pain in the shoulder, back of the head, in the back and in the neck. She wanted to know if she should to get the second dose or not, if she can get the shot in the gluteal or other sites. The event her throat got swollen was considered medically significant. The outcome of Vaccination site burning was recovered, of all other events was unknown.    No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp; her lips had started swelling; her tongue was tingling; she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction; she was just tired; type 1 hypersensitivity; a little soreness; It was like heaviness on her chest; having trouble breathing; allergic contact dermatitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a physician. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn&#39;t have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn&#39;t have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn&#39;t even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can&#39;t really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event &#39;she was just tired&#39; was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 15:00 at 0.45 mL, single dose (225mcg) at left arm to prevent COVID. Medical history included a bout of dry mouth about 7 years ago, no other relevant medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There&#39;s no adverse events following prior vaccinations. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. From the time she got the vaccine her mouth went completely dry on 23Dec2020 and she kept thinking it would go away and she still had it. Event was reported as serious per medically significant. Had a hard time swallowing at night from the dryness. Patient had the bitter taste was also on 23Dec2020, but it went away. It lasted about 5-6 hours. Then after that the dry mouth started right after. It is tolerable but she still had it. Mentioned she had a bout of dry mouth about 7 years ago and it did go away, but she never got a diagnosis for it. Patient thought that something underlying may have triggered it again. Patient also experienced burning of the tongue, tiredness, headaches, pressure in the chest area similar to difficulty in breathing, nausea, dizziness, and a fast heartbeat on unspecified date. Outcome of event dry mouth was not recovered, outcome of event bitter taste was recovered on unspecified date in Dec2020, outcome of other events was unknown. No family medical history relevant to adverse events. No relevant tests. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse events resulted in neither doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, nor emergency room/department or urgent care.   Relatedness of Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine with dry mouth and bitter taste per primary source reporter with method of assessment of global Introspection was related. Reporter seriousness for event bitter taste was not serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of dry mouth cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

                                                37 hours after Pfizer injection,  experienced severe abdominal pain that caused me to have vasovagal syncope.  Started sweating, and I lost my vision, then must have fallen on the floor.   When I came to, felt very headachy and nauseous.   went to urgent care - they ordered an abdominal scan for 2/8/21 but scan did not reveal the cause of the pain.  8 hours later on 2/5/21, started feeling asthma like symptoms.  Throat felt tight, voice became hoarse, kept having to cough because airway was starting to feel thickened.   went to ER, they took vitals and told me that i wasn&#39;t having  an allergic reaction because my symptoms were outside the time frame for an allergic reaction.  After 3 hours there, they sent me home.  Next morning felt like I was having heart palpitations. that feeling eventually went away if I walked around.  But the following two mornings, I had the same feeling.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Severe difficulty breathing; difficulty breathing frightened her; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 64 -year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), intramuscular (on the upper left shoulder) on 27Jan2021 09:20 (at the age of 64-year-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed about 14 years ago, breast cancer from Dec2017 and ongoing diagnosed in Dec2017, ongoing asthma she was diagnosed with asthma when she was 39 years old, surgery from an unknown date, she had surgery to correct a deviated septum and her asthma got better, she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). On 27Jan2021 she had the first injection. It was about 14 to 16 hours after the injection that she had severe difficulty breathing. Reported she has asthma. She was a cancer survivor, and she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. The difficulty breathing woke her out of her sleep. She had to call the doctor since she is concerned about her second dose which is scheduled for 17Feb2021. The difficulty breathing frightened her, and it was not an immediate reaction, she had the shot at 9:30 am (clarifies she received the injection at 09:20 am) and between 1 to 2 am in the night, she woke up not able to breathe. She could not use her inhaler since she could not really breathe in. She was obviously able to get some air in since she did not pass out. She contacted her doctor and he will send her a prescription to get an Epipen, so she has it on hand when she gets her second dose. Her doctor does not want her to not get the second dose. States she is concerned about other asthmatics receiving the vaccine and wanted to call and report this. She expected it to happen onsite where she received the injection but it did not. Her doctor asked her if she thought it was an asthma attack and she told her doctor that she has not felt like this in 24 years. Treatment/Outcome: She stepped out into the cold to shrink her airways and then was able to use her inhaler. Reports it was not a 2 hour episode thank god, and within 15 minutes she was able to force an inhaler dose in. Everything is fine. She is a breast cancer survivor and cannot use her right side so she had the injection on her left side in her upper shoulder, she has to wait 5 years to be considered cancer free. Her doctor suggested to use her albuterol inhaler for 4 days in advance of getting the second dose of the vaccine. She would think that would be abusing her albuterol but she will do that since she was instructed to do so by her doctor. She was terrified. She will have an Epipen on hand when she goes to get her second dose.  She understands the symptoms can be worse with the second dose, she is anticipating everything should be fine. The outcome of the event difficulty of breathing was recovered on Jan2021, for the other event was unknown. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations, states she has had everything. No Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks.

                                                I had severe COVID and was hospitalized on Dec 7,  I was in hospital (non ICU setting) for 5 days and had O2, remdisiver and dethemethzone IV.  I recovered fully, and have felt very good since mid January.  My reaction after my 1st dose of vaccine on Feb 25  started 20 hours after shot.  Worsened through the day and I got sicker at 24-36 hours, and then stayed in bed another day.  Symptoms were identical to my bout with COVID:  chills (no fever),  nausea, aches in joints and muscles, fatigue.  They were quite significant==I could not be out of bed.  As it went along I also developed the feeling in my chest like COVID--tough to take deep breath, chest hurt---but my O2 readings were fine.   Recovered after 48 hours, People who have had COVID should be aware that they will have a significant response to the vaccine on the 1st does.  I am questioning having a second dose I have not reported this to my doctor

                                                I was okay until after arriving home at which time I developed and headache and exhaustion. I went straight to bed for 2 days with headache, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t eat or drink. I started to feel a little better but still was unable to eat and was fatigued. When I did try to eat I got terrible diarrhea almost immediately. Over the next few days, realizing this was probably not normal, I contacted the advice nurse at my provider and eventually talk to a doctor on Friday (March 5). That doctor thought it sounded like I contracted COVID. I had a test that day that came back the next day negative. I have an appointment to talk to my regular doctor on Wednesday (March 10), particularly to get advise about whether to get the 2nd dose on March 20. My blood pressure has been unusually low (as low as 85/58) but is now about 120/60. I did not have a fever. My breathing has been more labored than usual, but my oxygen level is at 97% and my pulse is around 65.

                                                When driving home following 15 minute wait period I felt my throat tighten, ears flush and heart rate increasing.  I immediately began to monitor my heart rate with my Watch.  My resting heart rate is in the 60?s.  At the time I looked at the watch my heart rate was already in the low 100?s but was rapidly escalating until in a matter of a few minutes had reached 140 bpm and my head began to have a full sensation and I was  becoming very shaky.  I pulled over into the parking lot of a restaurant and asked them to call 911.  As they were talking with the dispatch my pulse started to decline so I cancelled the request.  I stayed at the restaurant until friends to could come pick me up.  By the time they arrived my pulse was in the low 100?s.  I took 2 Benadryl.  I monitored my BP through the night and it did not return to the 60?s until 1:00 am.   I took (2) 25 mg Benadryl at approximately 4:00 pm,  took another 2 at around 9:00 pm when my heart rate started to escalate and then a final 2 before going to bed at 1:00 am.  My pulse dropped back into the 60?s while I was sleeping and stayed that way through the night.  I woke up with no further symptoms nor side effects from the shot.  The throat tightness and flushing of the ears resolved after the first dose of Benadryl.  I had no adverse reactions or significant side effects from he first dose of Pfizer.

She was taken to the emergency room and was diagnosed with pericardial effusion and admitted for treatment that included draining fluid from the sac around her heart.  She was released and then developed the same symptoms again within a week.  She again had pericardial effusion, and was told she had severe emphysema with no prior diagnosis.  She is still hospitalized and is now suffering heart failure with no clear diagnosis as to why, no acceptable plan of treatment, and a prognosis of wait and see.  She has consistently tested negative for Covid19.

                                                For two days following the vaccine (March 6 &amp; 7) I experienced severe body aches, fever, chills, fatigue. Horrible shortness of breath began on the third day, March 8, and continued to worsen. For the next week my breathing became more and more labored with difficulty in functioning and needing to be in a reclining position in order to breathe. By the 10th day, o n March 15th I was hospitalized and subsequently had tests run on heart and lungs. My blood oxygen would drop to the low 80&#39;s if I took just a few steps. Today, on March 19th I am home and slowly improving but still needing to be mostly resting.

She also claimed she was light headed and had a wave of nausea right after her vaccine. She said she has never had a vaccine reaction like this before and claims she ate breakfast this morning.

I am sure later I had a TIA. Was unable to communicate. I knew what I wanted to say but I could not get the words out. March 1/2021   I went on FLMA. It never dawned on me the vaccine could have affected my already stressed heart. I am still experiencing these symptoms. I just thought of this this week. I still have extreme fatigue, increased palpitations,  and increased SOB. I do not feel able to work right now.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021. States she had real bad pressure in her head and high blood pressure and felt like her heart was skipping beats on unspecified date. States her blood pressure was around 152/100 on 09Mar2021. One-day blood pressure was real low, 88 over something but that kind of went away. States all that information was already reported. The next week, she thought she was feeling better and that Monday and Tuesday felt back to normal. Stated that on Thursday night (Mar2021), she was just sitting and around 8 o&#39;clock her blood pressure spiked within a few minutes to around 184/105 and she wasn&#39;t doing anything; she couldn&#39;t get it to go down. States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor. Stated she was on a really low dose of blood pressure medication, stating that she had occasional problems with her blood pressure in the past but it never went that high. Her blood pressure was usually in the 140&#39;s or 150&#39;s over 90 something. States that now it is much higher and happening every night. Caller stated that Wednesday night (24Mar2021) her blood pressure started to spike every 5 to 6 hours, stating it first started at 830 at night and again at 230 in the morning. She has been feeling unwell since that shot. Her doctor thinks it may be causing inflammation. States that they doubled her medication last night and her blood pressure is still going up and up, but usually goes down after a couple of hours. It is totally uncontrolled and her doctors are trying to figure it out. States that meds have been added, including Xanax and will be going to see a heart doctor. States that this has all been since the vaccine. Caller would like to know if people are reporting these symptoms. States that it is pretty terrible, and that she feels normal and then it rushes over her. States that it is exhausting and that she almost went to the ER last night. States that she does not want to go back if she does not have to. When she filed the first report she did not have issues with blood pressure yet. Again, she had the vaccine on Monday 08Mar2021 and that the next Thursday she felt like her heart rate was really high. During that first week, she felt out of rhythm, like missing beats. Her blood pressure dropped low the first week and that just one time was around 152/100 but it didn&#39;t sustain. It then dropped pretty low one day. The next Thursday, it was uncontrollable. It was around 180 over 104 or 105 and that it kept going up, but then back down to 160/90 something. Took Xanax and went to bed, when she woke up this morning it was low, but went right back up within 5 minutes. In the first couple of days, they increased her blood pressure medicine and it seemed to be bringing her blood pressure down and she was able to go to bed. The caller stated that Monday, it will be three weeks. States that a day and a half after the vaccine, her arm was not hurting but was still puffy, but not bad. States that when she runs her hands over it, it is still sore to the touch and a little swollen but nothing extreme. She was concerned that her blood pressure keeps going up and then down. States that the blood pressure started spiking on the 18Mar2021, in the evening very quickly and was very high. Stated that this was happening every night since then until the 24th, when it started spiking every 5-6 hours; and her blood pressure medicine wasn&#39;t controlling it like it was earlier in the week, even though the dose was doubled. For one day it worked good and brought it down low but then, it wasn&#39;t controlling it anymore. She stated no relevant tests, related to this event but states that in her last 2 labs her cholesterol was high. States that it was over 300 and her bad cholesterol double or more triple. States this has been going on for many years. States that she changed her calcium to calcium with vitamin D and her vitamin has come back up. When she was in the ER they did a Metabolic panel and everything looked okay. The adverse events require and emergency room visit.

                                                right breast pain; Shoulder pain; can&#39;t move shoulder/ can&#39;t move her arm/ her shoulder is immobile; Shortness of breath; Anxiety; breast is hard; shoulder pain was going down her back to the trapezius/ all the way to the back; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse, the patient. This 64-year-old female patient reported for herself that she received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8731) via an unspecified route in the left arm on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 (at the age of 64-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tick bite, blood pressure, nerve pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sciatica. The patient had no family history. The patient had no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) of the COVID vaccine. Ongoing concomitant medications included olmesartan for blood pressure, duloxetine for nerve pain, omeprazole for GERD, famotidine for GERD; all taken for years, meloxicam for sciatica taken for 2 months and ongoing and doxycycline from 16Apr2021 and ongoing for tick bite (reported that she kept forgetting to take it). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8727) on 28Mar2021 at 12:00 in the left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. That dose went in the deltoid and she had no issues. Then she received the second dose on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 in the left arm. She believes it was administered in the soft tissue behind the deltoid. She noticed the person who gave the injection went behind the muscle toward the back of the arm. The next day after the second dose, she felt fine. Then the second morning it felt as if her shoulder was dislocated; and her breast is hard and painful; and she can&#39;t breath. She called her doctor who said that was not a common side effect but she stated she knows it is a side effect. The doctor recommended she go to the ER but patient didn&#39;t want to go. She stated that she doesn&#39;t know if missing the muscle is going to let the medication absorb or if it has penetrated the soft tissue. The clinical course of events was further described as follows: On 20Apr2021 at 08:00, the second morning, she woke up and felt severe pain in her right breast and shoulder all the way to back; adds she can&#39;t move her arm and her breast is so painful she can&#39;t touch it and her shoulder is immobile. She is also having very bad shortness of breath, adds she thought that may be from anxiety; so later in the day she took a alprazolam (XANAX). She added that she put up with the pain all morning and thought maybe she was working herself up so she took one half of a Xanax to calm down, to see if it was just anxiety but the shortness of breath and pain were still there. She reported she was continuing to feel all of these effects at the same level. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the ER because of the expense. The shoulder pain was going down her back to the trapezius. She clarified that she can move her shoulder and her arm, but the pain was so breathtaking that she doesn&#39;t move it and she has her arm in a sling. There were no relevant tests performed. The clinical outcome of the events right breast pain, breast is hard, shoulder pain, shoulder pain going down her back, shortness of breath, can&#39;t move shoulder/arm/ shoulder is immobile, and anxiety was not recovered. The patient mentioned that she doesn&#39;t know if not getting the shot in the deltoid caused her symptoms or not.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:00 in left deltoid at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, bilateral thyroidectomy in 2014. Family Medical History: Father died of lung cancer. Mother died of cardiac arrest in 1972. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for bilateral thyroidectomy. The patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 27Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

                                                my lower extremities went cold for an instant when they gave the vaccine but it quickly passed. Wait half an hour of post vaccination observation and it went well. On the return car the feeling of cold returned to me in my arms and legs. When I got home I felt good and I prepared something for lunch, when I started eating, around 3.30 pm (about an hour and a half after getting the vaccine) I started to feel bad, my heart was beating very strong and fast, I was gasping for air, dizzy. I used the oximeter and I saw that my heart rate was at 110 and kept going up and the oxygen was going down. I called 911 when the blood pressure monitor and oximeter reached the limit and started flashing, oxygen at 92 and pulses at 141. I thought I was dying. The 911 operator told me to lie down and wait for the paramedics and she stayed with me on the line. I also put ice on my chest. When they arrived my signs began to normalize. I can&#39;t quite remember what happened next that day.

I had body aches, chills , didn?t feel well for first 48 hours after the shot, ok now, just still tender at injection site, that is improving. Concerned I may have had a mild allergic reaction, worried about getting 2nd dose, but my doctor told me to take Benadryl prior to second dose &amp; have someone drive me to the appointment, and get the second dose.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 16Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose as the patient is a counselor, essential worker, in the health field but she got in because of age (COVID-19 immunization). Medical history included Subclinical hypothyroid (she takes no meds. Was diagnosed 10 years ago), allergies to Sulfa drug, seasonal allergies and sprained wrist. A couple antibiotics bother her stomach but she was not allergic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included estradiol, B12, calcium and glucosamine. Other medications included estrogen, vitamins, glucosamine supplements, and takes a cream for injury: sprained wrist, she doesn&#39;t know the name of it, it is an anti-inflammatory cream, she doesn&#39;t think any of that will do anything. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had the vaccine on 16Jan2021 Saturday and within 15 minutes (also reported as 20 minutes after shot and at 12:00), the patient experienced severe ringing in ears. She had severe ringing in her ears, it was really loud, and was still there. She can&#39;t seem to figure out if it was normal, what&#39;s causing it and could it be from the vaccine. It may have been anxiety because of that, but right after she heard ringing, there was a lump feeling in her throat on same day, like something was in her throat, she thought she had throat swelling, it lasted a couple of days, but she had no shortness of breath or anything. Ringing in ears was a lot worse in the morning, and gets better during the day, maybe because she was around noise, but it comes and goes, there are two separate sounds, one was a high pitched and continuous, the other one was lower pitched, a little fragmented, if she drew a picture, there would be little dust particles in the air, but the other is constant, she tried really hard to ignore, but it was driving her nuts. She is hoping it will go away. The lump feeling in her throat was gone, she was wondering if it was anxiety. It was mentioned, &#34;She gets nervous, gets a lump in her throat a lot&#34;, but this was really severe, but she saw a man being taken away in an ambulance, and that scared her, she was waiting in the waiting area, and saw that, so it scared her. Recovered completely from the lump feeling in her throat. Throat was normal in 2 days but ears ringing still there after 4 days. There was no treatment for the events severe ringing in ears and Lump feeling in throat. The outcome of the events severe ringing in ears was not recovered; event Lump feeling in throat and throat swelling was recovered in 18Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other event.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

                                                1 PM I received the vaccine and withing 5 minutes had a slight pain on the left side of my head which then continued to a pain in my neck. also left side, then back pain, then slightly short of breath. I remained in the waiting area for over a half hour and felt no worse, but did report it to the young woman at the exit who said that was odd and seemed the kind of response with the second dose. I presumed it might be due to my already having antibodies. As I continued my day those symptoms quickly dispersed and I felt fine, albeit with a light soreness at the site on my left arm. At approximately 6pm I felt very fatigued and rested until 10pm, when I began to have chills, a headache and nausea. My left arm was also so sore I could not lay comfortably. I took Tylenol and aspirin both at 11:30 pm and attempted to sleep, which was fitful and disturbing. I had strange neurological events, such as odd visions in my half sleep and bizarre semi dreams but could not waken. At 4:00 AM I finally was able to pull out of this state and the last thing in my mind was a conversation with someone trying to explain what was happening to me, in my mind not vocal, that was in Italian. That is my second language. All day I had unwanted words, ideas etc. floating about in my brain. I could no longer sleep and was very weak, had terrible head and body aches and my legs also ached terribly. I was also slightly nauseous.These were all symptoms, minus the disturbing neurological one, that I had with Covid. I was too weak to leave the bed until much later in the day. I am still having effects but much less and I am at the 72 hour mark. I remained at rest all day and ran a low fever, then again a fever

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                About 10 minutes after the shot I felt a warm sensation inside my arm running all the way down to my arm and my hand went numb .  I waited a few more minutes then I was released.  Then 1/2 hour later my eyes were very sensitive to light I wore sunglasses. Then five hours after the shot I had chest discomfort on left side of my chest which felt like I was having a heart attack pain subsided then every 2 hours it came and went until the middle of the night. Then next day still having same chest pain. Then I had difficulty swallowing was choking so I called my doctor. I also had trouble breathing. Dr. Advised to go to ER if I needed to. I rested and rested and monitored myself. Blood pressure fluctuated somewhat. Still had chest pain and discomfort 24 hours after the vaccine. I had never had chest pain or discomfort before. It was quite alarming. Not being able to swallow was alarming also. Several years ago I had an allergic reaction to a cleaning problem some of the same symptoms it was very scary no heart or chest pain with that allergic reaction to a cleaning product that had bleach in the product.

Was sent to Urgent Care office where I got EKG, which showed no problems with my heart. Went home, weak.  Woke at 2:00 am with night sweats. When I got up I noticed swelling on face, throat, hands &amp; feet. Faint pink rash ran up both fore arms and I had welts rising on my wrists. Nurse line I called said to to to ER asap, Took me a few hours to find a ride, my throat was closing up more by that point. I could tell over a few hours that my throat was swelling up. Went to nearest ER where I was very mentally confused. They  gave me a shot of steroids and Benedryl.  Later that night I got chills and was VERY weak. Had night sweats again. After a few days of rest, am still weak.

Two hours after receiving vaccine patient experienced a &#34;prickly sensation&#34; and broke out in red bumps on back, arms, wrists, stomach, legs, and behind knees. Bumps were red in color at itchy. Patient took a dose of diphenhydramine and that helped throat tightness, but did not relieve rash. Patient bathed in Dawn Dish soap, which helped to calm the itch temporarily. Rash has not completely gone away, as of 3/17/21 patient still suffers from itchy bumps on legs.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia secondary to acute CHF exacerbation. The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed 2 weeks prior to hospitalization that was noted to show a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%. At the hospitalization, her left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to decrease to 25-30%. Left heart catheterization was performed and showed no signs of ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease). Patient was started on Entresto 24/26mg PO BID and Toprol XL 50mg PO daily and was diuresed with Bumex 1mg IV daily and was noted to have improvement in respiratory symptoms for which she was weaned off of BiPAP 15/5 with FiO2 of 50% down to room air. Patient had repeat transthoracic echocardiogram ordered prior to discharge and was noted to have an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction to 48% prior to discharge. The only change was that the patient had the COVID-19 vaccination. Patient does not have any history of coronary artery disease or heart failure. Patient was worked up extensively for other etiologies of heart failure and none were found.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Next day (Thurs. 3/18) extreme pain in neck, chest and shoulder area, headache, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, brain fog, malaise. I thought it would pass. Friday I felt no better - by evening I felt swelling in my neck and chest area. Noticeable swelling in clavicle area on both sides. Saturday &amp; Sunday I rode it out until I could see my Dr. on Monday March 22. Dr. gave me a shot of steroids and a script for MethylPREDNISolone - 21 tablets. Today is Tuesday, March 23, 2021 and I feel much, much better. Dr. said to NOT get the 2nd shot and to report this reaction.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 07Mar2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy history to a of number of medication and things (I&#39;m prone to allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 07Mar2021, the patient received the first dose and she went to sit in the observation area for 5 minutes. The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose. The patient was asking for information about 2nd dose being given after 42 days. The patient stated that she has not had any more of those symptoms at all. The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                On-set on dizziness, severe pain and swelling in left arm. 6 hour later, severe pain shooting up my arm, radiating up my neck to my left ear. Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

                                                Started about 3am Saturday Morning March 6 with extreme pain between shoulder blades. Took 2 Advil and was able to go back to sleep. Woke in the morning feeling fine. Then started becoming ill early afternoon. Fever every day for 2 weeks. Nausea, vomiting, lose of appetite, extreme fatigue, headache, light sensitivity, rash, nagging slight cough and some nasal stuffiness mostly when talking (this might be because of the pollen) We were told it was an unidentified virus that would have to &#34;run its course&#34;. Even though we are vaccinated, we continue to quarantine because we provide child care for my grandson. There was virtually no circumstance where I would have been exposed to a virus. Also, my husband had to care for me because I could do almost nothing for myself and he did not contract the virus.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half. Confirmed she was not admitted just in the Emergency Room. On 04Mar202 the patient was at the hospital and was gasping for breath. The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her. On 10Mar2021 she was starting to feel a little bit better as regarded anaphylactic reaction, she has recovered with residual effects from the anaphylactic reaction. Confusion was improved but stull a concern. The outcome of anaphylactic reaction was recovered with sequelae, of headache, swollen lips, confused was recovering, of gasping for air, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, throat closing/restriction in her throat, sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips was unknown. Patient asked if there was a conclusion about the PEG and her anaphylactic reaction. Her second dose was scheduled on 25Mar2021. Patient stated that her PCP and the CDC recommend to not get the second dose. Caller wanted to know if the anaphylaxis could be worse in the second dose. The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life. Patient wanted to know if she can get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine after a certain amount of time after receiving the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, caller cannot get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine due to a reaction. As of 12Mar2021 patent stated she does not wish to be contacted any further.   A Product Complaint was filed.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6198, NDC number: 59267100001, Expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 65-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

On 06Mar2021, her lymph nodes in her throat swelled up and her throat was raw, painful, super red and she could hardly talk, it also created a lot of congestion in chest- the lobes. The swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. She wound up going to the doctor and they prescribed her an antibiotic which cleared the infection in her throat. Her symptoms started two days after she received the shot. She is supposed to get the second shot on Thursday 25Mar2021 and that&#39;s why she is calling to find out information on what other people reported as far as asthma patients. She is debating on getting the second shot. Initially caller states that for the most part, it cleared up and went away about three days ago, but then explains it is gradually getting better. Every once in a while, her throat feels dry and raw, but she drinks water and it feels better. At first, she did not want to really talk. She has asthma, the congestion never really goes away and it didn&#39;t really improve this time after prednisone like it usually does. She did not feel good on Friday, but on Saturday it got bad. Her side effects have improved from what they were then. The patient recovered from the event swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. The outcome of got pretty sick and throat feels dry was unknown and the outcome of the remaining events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 23Mar2021 19:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing laryngopharyngeal reflux diagnosed about 5 years ago, ongoing anxiety, usually happens during stressful circumstances; diagnosed about 20 years ago and she had had the sensation of labored breathing, dry mouth, and accelerated heart rate then yes for work like with public speaking; sensitive: Sulfa drugs, aesthetic filler in her face and allergic reaction Hyaluronic acid filler collagen and she doesn&#39;t smoke and drink. Family history included daughter was diagnosed with psychotic episode and diagnosed with mental illness and it was stressful getting that under control and she was sensitive to medication and surgical procedures she doesn&#39;t tolerate narcotics. Concomitant medication included clonazepam (KLONOPIN). She reported that she was prescribed .125 of clonazepam and it was a dissolvable sublingual and she doesn&#39;t use it frequently as she has read about reliance and potentially addictive and she will take a walk or watch a boring video to try to get her mind off it. The patient previously took oxycodone hydrochloride; oxycodone terephthalate; paracetamol (PERCOCET) and she was sensitive to Percocet; and darvocet and experienced sensitive to Darvocet post surgery; and codeine, and vicodin and was sensitive to both drugs, advil and causes her stomach to be upset, shingles vaccine, HPV vaccine, chicken pox vaccine and got 1 pox from that about 15 years ago when it first came out. The only post-surgical medicine pain reliever she can take was Tramadol and more often than not she doesn&#39;t have to do anything beyond Tylenol extra strength. On 24Mar2021, 04:00, the patient experienced extreme chills, and anxiety accompanied with tight, shallow, and labored breathing. She had troubled breathing due to this. She mentioned that she went to the emergency room (ER) that morning. On 27Mar2021, the patient had emphysema and agitation. On 26Mar2021, early in the morning, she had the breathing issue that she mentioned first concurrent with agitation and anxiety like at same time with the extreme chills. The sensation of agitation was all combined together, it like hit out of the blue while she was getting ready to go to sleep. She stated that at 4am it hit her with a sudden bout of extreme chills and at the same time a sense of anxiety, it felt like she hit a wall and couldn&#39;t get a full breath. She stays up late but wasn&#39;t doing anything anxiety provoking, she thought she was reading recipes. She sat to calm herself as she was not sure if it was a reaction or anxiety at the initial reaction fueling it further so she tried to sort of lower everything in her system and was concerned it could accelerate and not subside. At the hospital, they took her in an exam room and did her vitals and she was there about 2-3 hours and it was early in the morning and at that point sometime they took a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work and at that point prior to that while she was waiting she was feeling a little better, the worst had subsided and she suggested she go and they asked her to stay since she was already checked in and to be seen. The doctor looked at the results and read the film and questioned about emphysema and she felt that was unrealistic reading as she doesn&#39;t smoke, doesn&#39;t drink and it&#39;s not in her genetic make up. The doctor told her lungs were showing a lot of air and she said maybe it was because she was gasping and they told her to take a big gulp of a breath and hold it to get the X-ray. The doctor suggested she see a pulmonologist and she didn&#39;t feel that was warranted. She contacted her general practitioner and they recommended she get the 2nd shot and had her see an allergist who also suggested she get the 2nd shot. The patient stated that she was not really overweight and doesn&#39;t drink and doesn&#39;t smoke and the allergist didn&#39;t mention but she saw in the paperwork that a side effect could be difficulty breathing. She had no swelling, body rash, dizziness or weakness. Since that episode, she periodically throughout the day, and she can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s anxiety or allergies or something but she felt labored breathing and tightness in her chest and can&#39;t get a full intake of breath. She reported that when she sleeps on her back the sensation disappears completely and when she sleeps on her side it reappears a little; 1-2 nights after, it woke her from sleep and she doesn&#39;t think she was dreaming about anxiety. She stated that she has never had anaphylactic if this should escalate what to do and she decided to go to the ER and they had her wait an additional 2 hours for a follow-up reading that was all clear, all fine, except emphysema thing which was again, she was just researching and forgot the medical term, she this it was hype aeration, too much air sucked in. Her general practitioner recommended she see an allergist for a 2nd opinion and was surprised she was up on anything and didn&#39;t mention side effect and the handout said it could be a possible side effect. She has to yawn a lotto get the air in. She does have laryngopharyngeal reflux prior and she clears her throat which is probably annoying and controls that through diet instead of taking Pepcid AC. She has had to clear her throat a lot but never had labored breathing or shortness of breath, that to get a full breath sometimes she has to yawn to get past that tightness of shallow breathing or labored breathing. On certain days she doesn&#39;t feel it and thinks it was done and she will have a spate and it happens and she thought there was something stressing and does a reality check and again it&#39;s that time of year and when she was taking her walk and walked past a certain block she started to wheeze from the pollen on an unspecified date and she called her allergist to see about getting something. She had a mask and that helped a little. Her allergies were not exacerbating on 23Mar2021 or 26Mar2021 but started the last few days and she has a wheezing cough that had an extended sort of wheeze at the end of the cough. Before her cough for LPR it was annoying throat clearing. After the vaccine, she took that walk through that one specific spot on her route she got to coughing and thinking she needs to call and get something prescribed something if anything if she gets the second shot it will address any of the side issues if they were related to allergies so don&#39;t have to contend. It was every night where she sort of feels it and she sleeps through the night so if it was tension related it subsides and can&#39;t distinguish what is emotional and physical but she was sleeping through the night and it was an indication that it was improving. She reported that when she visited her son and after she returned he told her he was unaware he had strep and didn&#39;t know it, he was asymptomatic and she had a sore throat and went to urgent care and had an exam and didn&#39;t have strep and doesn&#39;t know what it was but she was feeling better by the weekend. She was supposed to go back and everything was shutting and she didn&#39;t go. Maybe she was exposed and just had a mild thing while she was there. She was tested for Covid on 26Mar2021 and her result was negative, but they did not do an antibody test. She wanted to know if difficulty breathing was a common reaction with the vaccine, and if the side effects would be lesser after the 2nd dose since she already had a severe reaction after the 1st dose and if she should still receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine. She was concerned the 2nd shot will be more pronounced than the 1st and she doesn&#39;t want to go through that and it be more severe.  She has heard if you had that reaction you may have been exposed to Covid before and she may have been around people with Covid that had positives and she may have antibodies from an asymptomatic experience and it may do more harm than good and she should do the 2nd shot. She mentioned this to her allergist and was told if she has a similar symptoms to call and get a bronchodilator. She was onboard with that but wants to discuss it because she finds it hard to believe she was the only one that had difficulty breathing and was wondering what was the duration of this labored breathing. She was scheduled for the second dose 18Apr2021. Outcome of events sore throat was recovered on an unspecified date; and outcome of rest of events was unknown.

A 65-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8757) at the age of 65-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 31Mar2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date and no vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously took aspirin and experienced allergy which was described as deadly. She never took medications since she found that out at 16-year-old. The patient received her first shot on 31Mar2021 at a pharmacy and mentioned that she was not sick at the time of vaccination, but she had a violent reaction to it. When she received it, she didn&#39;t feel anything. People said you will get a sore arm, but she got none of that. Then in the middle of the night on Friday (02Apr2021) probably around 3:00, she woke up with acute pain on the left side, it was rib pain, she thought she cracked her rib. On the same day, she also experienced difficulty breathing, and didn&#39;t sleep at all. On Saturday morning (03Apr2021), when she woke up, she had nausea, a headache, and extreme fatigue, but wondered if the extreme fatigue was because she did not sleep. The nausea and headache went away 8 hours later, on the same day. On Sunday (04Apr2021), she was coughing and coughed up blood. When she coughed, there was blood in the mucous. She mentioned that she still has acute pain, she could not get comfortable. Her sister passed away in January and she had a 5 pm train she was supposed to catch, she was responsible for the funeral. She was thinking that if she went to a hospital, they would keep her for 24 hours, she could maybe make it to the funeral but that was questionable. By Monday (05Apr2021), the acute pain was gone, she still had a cough, there was still blood in the mucous, she has occasionally blood in the mucous. The cough has not gone away but she was getting better every day. The difficulty breathing continued until about 08Apr2021 (as reported), but she still has some shortness of breath, but nowhere near as bad. She consulted her notes and said she was at 30% on 03Apr2021 and she felt today that she was at 80% and every day she was a little better and better. She has to sleep upright, she was afraid to sleep flat, she slept in her chair, last night for 2 nights she slept upright in her bed. She probably could lay down, but she was more comfortable upright. Because she was sleeping upright, she was not fatigued, she was not sleeping well but she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with what was going on. The events did not result in emergency room or physician office visit. She is supposed to get her second dose on 21Apr2021but she did not want to get the second shot. She asked if she could wait and get the one shot from Johnson &amp; Johnson. She didn&#39;t know where to go anymore. The outcome of the event &#34;acute pain on the left side, she thought she cracked her rib/ rib pain&#34; was recovered on 05Apr2021, recovered on 03Apr2021 for &#34;nausea&#34; and &#34;headache&#34;, recovered on Apr2021 for &#34;extreme fatigue&#34;, not recovered for &#34;didn&#39;t sleep at all&#34;, and recovering for all other events.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 09:40 (Lot Number: EN6199) (at the age of 65 years old) as single dose (dose 1) for COVID-19 immunisation; and methylprednisolone (MEDROL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at short term increase of the Medrol dose (as reported), from  unspecified date to an unspecified date at 2 mg (for four years, as reported), then from unspecified date to 10Mar2021 at 6 mg, then from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021 at 8 mg, then from 14Mar2021 to unspecified date at 6 mg, for Lupus. Medical history included diagnosed with asthma initially exercised induced and now it is seasonal and was diagnosed years ago (states she has not had to use her Albuterol inhaler that much now because it is seasonal but she is doing more outside and is allergic to outside things so she tends to use the inhaler more if needed), right leg paresthesia (she did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine), autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder and patient stated that she has lost height. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus. She had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 1st dose and then three days later on 10Mar2021 at 16:00, she thought what is going on and had her tongue tip so irritated and a strange feeling that it was a tiny bit edematous, her lower lip was full tingling. She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn&#39;t swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red. The next morning on 11Mar2021, her upper lip was tingling and she did go see her healthcare professional in town and sent photos to her Rheumatologist. As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn&#39;t catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn&#39;t see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Events required a visit to physician office (No visit to the ER but did see her physician). The last action taken in response to the events for methylprednisolone was unknown. The outcome of the event had left clavicle pain under the clavicle was recovered on 12Mar2021; event has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red was recovered in Mar2021; outcome for the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 based on strong temporal association, but possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications cannot be completely ruled out.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 66-year-old female patient (pregnant at the time of vaccination: no) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) via intramuscular at left arm on 11Jan2021 12:15 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diastolic CHF, spinal stenosis, morbid obesity, epilepsy, pulmonary hypertension and COVID-19 (Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19). The patient received medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included amiodarone, melatonin, venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR), ibuprofen, aripiprazole (ABILIFY), lisinopril, cranberry capsules, diltiazem, paracetamol (TYLENOL), famotidine, furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), ipratropium bromide, salbutamol sulfate (IPRATROPIUM/ALBUTEROL), buspirone, senna alexandrina leaf (SENNA [SENNA ALEXANDRINA LEAF]), polyethylene glycol 3350 and morphine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient used took Penicillin, propranolol, quetiapine, topiramate, Lamictal and had allergy to them. Patient used took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EJ1685) via intramuscular at right arm on 21Dec2020 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination, the patient been tested for COVID-19 (Sars-cov-2 PCR) via nasal swab on 06Jan2021, covid test result was negative. Patient was found pulseless and breathless 20 minutes following the vaccine administration (11Jan2021 12:30 AM). MD found no signs of anaphylaxis. Patient died on 11Jan2021 12:30 AM because of cardiac arrest. No treatment received for the events. Outcome of pulseless and breathless was unknown. the autopsy was performed, and autopsy remarks was unknown. Autopsy-determined cause of death was unknown.  It was reported as non-serious, not results in death, Life threatening, caused/prolonged hospitalization, disabling/Incapacitating nor congenital anomaly/birth defect.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information this patient had multiple underlying medical conditions including morbid obesity, diastolic CHF, epilepsy, pulmonary hypertension and COVID-19 diagnosed prior to vaccination. All these conditions more likely contributed to patients cardiac arrest resulting in death. However, based on a close temporal association (&#34;Patient was found pulseless and breathless 20 minutes following the second dose of BNT162B2 vaccine administration, contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine to the onset of reported events cannot be completely excluded.

I took 2 Benedryl tablets and experienced symptoms for the next hour. They subsided by 5:30 pm . I was able to breathe and swallow during the whole episode. I had very similar reactions several times in June when I was for unknown reasons experiencing hives and had same response when prescribed Bactrim, and then Keflex because of a UTI. I had no further incidents with the chest, throat, mouth reaction since mid June until yesterday.  I had no adverse reaction to the vaccine until 3.5 hrs after receiving it. I feel this is because my body has some sensitivity, not that anything was done incorrectly in administration of the vaccine. All personnel were very attentive and careful that I observed.

It was difficult to swallow, but not difficult to breathe.  I took 25 mg of Benadryl and 4 hours later took 50 mg of Benadryl.  The swelling did not diminish, but did not get worse.  When I woke up the next morning, everything was back to normal.

                                                I receive my second vaccination for Covid on January 4, 2021.  Less than 36 hours later I experience a rapid heart rate (110 - 128) and shortness of breath not related to activity.   I had anticipated body aches, chills etc and did have those as well.  Over the course of 4 - 5 days those resolved but my tachycardia and shortness of breath have not.  I waited another week to see if it would improve and when that did not occur I made an appointment to see Cardiologist because quite frankly, I was fearful of my symptoms.  My lungs remain clear, I have no difficulty taking a deep breath and my SAO2 is high 90&#39;s.  I had my annual physical 1/18/2021 and my lab work was normal as was my EKG.  I have never had shortness of breath and my heart rate was normally in the 70 - 80&#39;s range at rest.  Doctor ordered testing and the results are in My Chart.  I had a Echo/Stress/Echo which was normal.  My EF was 60% and in spite of my extreme shortness of breath on the treadmill, there was no ischemia induced.  Bp was elevated initially and during the test but returned to 130&#39;s/70&#39;s in recovery phase.  SAO2 was 97% to 100%.  I did a home sleep study on 1/31/2021 with results pending.  Doctor stated there was nothing on my testing that would account for my symptoms.  At my initial visit (1/26/2021)he started me on low dose Cardezem 120mg to address my heart rate.  My heart rate has improved with Cardezem (increased to 240 mg 2/2/2021) but my shortness of breath with minimal exertion has not.  I believe Doctor plans to order a PFT next.  Because of the timeframe for new onset symptoms and my Covid 19 vaccination, I wanted to reach out to you for guidance.  ? Second Covid Vaccination 1/4/2021 ? Shortness of breath and tachycardia 1/5/2021 ? Scheduled appointment with Cardiologist for 1/21/2021 and it was cancelled and rescheduled for 1/26/2021 ? Dr. appointment 1/26/2021, started on Cardezem 120 mg qd ? 1/31/2021 Sleep Study completed, results pending ? 2/2/2021 Echo/Stress/Echo completed, Cardezem increased to 240 mg qd ? PFT order pending ? Follow up with Doctor scheduled for 2/18/2021

                                                My lymph above my breast on left side became sore and it became difficult to take a deep breath. A couple of days later, the pain continued over to my right side also and same difficulty getting a deep breath. For awhile, the pain was in my right armpit too. Put warm compresses on areas and it helped a bit. My sister looked up info on the internet and found that ?Aleve? might help the pain, which it did. Called the  doctor?s office and they were not very helpful. The information my sister got from the internet was of more help. The difficulty getting a deep breath lasted 2 weeks.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

                                                After getting the  second Pfizer vaccine, I experienced shortness of breath. Riding my bike the shortness of breath was noticeable as I had to walk up hills I normally ride up and I was winded.  I went for a complete nuclear stress test with a known cardiologist and got a completely normal heart reading.  My heart is healthy, but I am experiencing shortness of breath all the time, more so when I exercise. My cardiologist said that even though there is only anecdotal evidence, other people have complained about symptoms lasting after the second shot and he recommended that I see how I feel in a month from now, although as an active person, I feel anxious about my symptoms.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Feb2021 (received at the age of 66-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold sores, 2 knee surgeries, and ADD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) from an unspecified date and ongoing (diagnosed at 30-years-old). Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and other regular medication. The patient received first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and developed numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye on 26Feb2021.  It felt like she had received a lidocaine injection.  Her doctor said this can happen with RNA vaccines, affect the 7th cranial nerve and develop Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She was prescribed Valacyclovir 1mg and has taken it for 3 days.  She wants to know what the other Bell&#39;s Palsy cases were like. She wants to know what their treatments were. Her doctor said it was okay to receive her second dose at 8am on 20Mar2021 but she wants to do her due diligence and see if there is a case report or study on these patients that developed this side effect. The patient further explained that she had her first dose on 26Feb2021 and was she was there for the 15 minutes for observation. On her way home, the right side of her mouth and the right side of her nostril were numb like Novocaine that you get at the dentist. She said that the numbness traveled up the right side of her jaw to her ear and then over to her right eye. When she got home, she told her daughter and she said that she thought it was because she volunteered all day and was worn out and anxious (26Feb2021). She said that she slammed water and ate crackers and after about a 1.5 hours she started to feel better. She said that she then she called her physician and the doctor told her that it was flaring the nerve root like bells palsy and that it is a RNA Virus. She said that she was placed on some medication for it, but was wondering if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She said that the doctor asked her if she had previously had cold sores and she said yes. The caller said that her doctor said that it is exactly what that is.

                                                On my way home from receiving the vaccine, I felt slight numbness in my lips (no further swelling, etc.).  Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

                                                about 1 hour and 15 minutes post injection (I waited in area as recommended for thirty minutes because of hx), I had the sudden onset of  itchy runny nose and  chest tightness and wheezing of significant intensity that I  needed to use inhaler then and again later in the day. Noteworthy, I had  as a precaution taken prednisone 20mg p.o  about 2 hours before the injection.  I had to take more  later that afternoon because of symptoms. I then seem better but several times since the vaccine I have needed to uses the inhaler  and take prednisone  more than I have except after an infection about 6 years ago that precipitated similar symptoms to now. Today I had a flare significant enough that except for covid I might have gone to the ER or urgent care.

                                                On Christmas day I was working and then you started feeling like a pinching in my chest, like when you are going to catch a cold, that went on through the afternoon. In the afternoon I started with light headache and dry cough (intermittent), no temperature. I did not take anything for it and continued working. When I got home, I felt weak and was supposed to join my family for Christmas and decided not to go. And went to sleep. The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

                                                I received the 2nd Covid injection.  I went to the 15-minute waiting area.  The waiting area was full, so my husband and I were standing.  I stand and work every day, so this was not difficult.  I texted my daughter, who is a hospital employee, and told her that we had a super experience with no wait and had already received our 2nd dose.  However, 5 to 7 minutes after the injection, I SUDDENLY felt dizzy and weak and had to sit down.  Within a minute or so, I could not stand or open my eyes.  The weakness made it difficult to breath or talk.  My husband had to lift me up into a wheelchair.  I was taken to the ER.  For the longest time, I could not even open my eyes or talk above a whisper. After 4 hours, I was able to get my eyes open and talk better.  I, gradually, was able to move my hands and feet.  Last of all, I could move my hips and walk.   It was as if my body had been put to sleep.  I could feel everything but my body wouldn?t move.  As it wore off, my face and limbs felt slightly tingly.  I was, basically, fine after 5 hours other than being tired from the experience. The doctors had no explanation for what happened and said it must be an emotional response to getting the shot.  They wrote that I was not exerting enough effort to move my body.  One said that I was hyperventilating when I pulled my mask up to breathe after he told me to hold my leg in the air.  Though I tried, I was too weak to hold my leg up and it fell to the bed. The doctor told me that I should not tell anyone about what had happened or people would not come to get the Covid vaccination.  He obviously knew that SOMETHING had happened that I couldn&#39;t control but he didn&#39;t put that in his report!

Then I started to have tightness in my chest and used my albuterol inhaler.   I was still having symptoms an hour later so took Benadryl 25 mg.  During the night I woke up with mild wheezing and used my inhaler again.  Throughout the next 2 days, I continued to have these symptoms (except for wheezing) off and on.  Today, I still have some symptoms but not as often or severe.

                                                About ten minutes after the shot, my heart suddenly started pounding, I was panting, and I got very hot.  Then tingling went all over my body, even in my lips.  At one point, I felt close to fainting.  The pharmacist lady gave me cold water (I asked for it), and I just sat there for quite a while.  Gradually my heart rate came down, and I got cold, but the tingling kept going, and I felt somewhat weak.  Since I didn&#39;t want any epinephrine (it affects my heart), and I didn&#39;t think I was so bad that I needed an ambulance, after being there nearly an hour my husband drove me home.  There I took some liquid Benadryl, and that seemed to help with the tingling.  I just took it easy after that.  Considering my reaction tothe first dose, I will NOT be getting the second one.  I don&#39;t need to consult with a doctor to decide that.  It was somewhat frightening because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was going to get.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

Today I started feeling better and able to walk for 30 minutes without any problems. Hives also subsided. I had no asthma or hives attack for the last three years.

                                                Discussed vaccine ADE after first dose with patient. Pt reports having existing lung disease for which she uses oxygen and CPAP overnight. She reports feeling fatigued and increased SOB on exertion and increased O2 requirement for 2d after  receiving vaccine. She also reports intermittent sweating and feeling hot on her head and scalp but without chills or bodyaches for 3 weeks now. When she checked her temperature at home, she reports temps of 98 or 99. Based on discussion, her reaction is not  likely to be an allergic reaction and more likely an immune response to vaccine. Patient agrees to proceed with 2nd dose and will continue to monitor symptoms.

A 67-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCIN) lot number: GL9266, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rheumatic fever (occurred age 7), vulvovaginal dryness and sore joints. The patient was negative on Covid test on an unspecified date. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 28Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and flu shot. Concomitant medications included estradiol (IMVEXXY) taken for vulvovaginal dryness; vitamin C [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); calcium. On Monday, 22Feb2021, the patient felt draggy, but did not think it was a big deal. She just thought it was from the shot and was feeling tired. The draggy feeling lasted a few days, but she was unable to clarify outcome further. On Tuesday, she started to feel achy and felt like that too was to be expected. The achiness went away on 25Feb2021. On Wednesday, 24Feb2021, she was really busy. She was still achy but was busy. She also did not drink much water for several hours. It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills. It was a horrible feeling. She helps with her grandkids since she is retired. They were home from school and had to sit on the couch. She felt cold, yucky, and achy. It was a yucky feeling. She went home a couple of hours later. She told her husband she had to lie down on the couch because she felt horrible. She could not further describe horrible feeling. Her daughter had called her as well and was unable to describe how she felt to her daughter. She could only say she felt so sick but could not explain further. She felt awful and could not put her finger on it. She was laying down and when she got up, she felt like she would pass out. At that time, she had not eaten dinner yet. She ate dinner, took one bite and the food came back up. For a few moments she felt so faint, she felt shortness of breath, but it was only for a few seconds. After that, her and her and her husband took a drive to go to hospital. However, by the time she got to hospital she was feeling better. She was also talking to a friend at that time who said all of this was probably form the shot as well. Since she was feeling better decided not to go into the hospital and went back home. At the time she was thinking this was all from the shot and no big deal. On Wednesday night, things got crazy and worse.

                                                I woke up, and could not get out of bed  because I was sick. Aches and pain on entire body, tired, malaise, and  sick.  Then I got the chills, accompanied with a fever. My everyday temperature is 96.7 and I had a 99.7 fever.  My eyes were glassy and grey.   I was like this until the next day.  I had COVID19 on 11/18/2020 - I did not have the above symptoms of aches and pains or a fever or the chills.  My breathing and coughing finally was 99% better by February 2, 2021. My taste and smell is not back yet. Are there studies on how people react to vaccination if they had the COVID19? Is there research comparing prior COVID19 symptoms with adverseReactions symptoms?

                                                I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She received the first round of the vaccine (Pfizer/EL9269) on 2/18/21. That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

A contactable other healthcare professional and a consumer (patient) reported that a 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; treprostinil sodium (TYVASO, concentration of 0.6 mg/ml), resp inhalation (reported as via inhalation (IH) route) from 23Sep2020 (batch/lot number: 2101929; expiration date: 31Jan2022) to an unspecified date, delivered by Tyvaso inhalation device (TD-300/A) at 18-54 ug, QID (3-9 breaths), then via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (batch/lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at 72 ug to 60 ug (12 to 10 breaths) for secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. Medical history included ongoing secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Concomitant medication included tadalafil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced events of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hospitalized), hypertension (hypertension, hospitalized) and reaction to COVID vaccine (vaccination complication, hospitalized). On an unreported date, the patient experienced events of really sick (illness), nausea (nausea) and headache (headache). On an unreported date, the patient had decreased breaths from 12 to 10 breaths (off label use). It was also reported that the patient had decreased breaths from 72 ug to 60 ug (12 to 10 breaths). The patient was really sick, nausea and headache. On 25Mar2021, 6 months and 3 days after initiating IH Tyvaso, the patient was hospitalized for reaction to coronavirus disease (COVID) vaccine, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, and hypertension. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 28Mar2021. The action taken in response to the events chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and vaccination complication for treprostinil sodium was not reported, and dose was decreased due to the events illness, nausea and headache. At the time of reporting, the outcome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, vaccination complication, illness, nausea and headache was unknown. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and vaccination complication. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events illness, nausea and headache with IH treprostinil sodium was considered to be possibly related.   Case Comment/Sender&#39;s Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse event of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and vaccination complication as not related to IH treprostinil and TD-300/A device. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension were likely due to exacerbation of underlying COPD and Hypertension respectively. Vaccination complication was due to COVID vaccine.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is based on the company causality assessment.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, vaccination complication, illness, headache, nausea and the suspect drug BNT162B2 , TYVASO cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one.

Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right leg on 15Mar2021 09:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergy, asthma, atrial fibrillation, urticaria. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) as pre treated; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as pre treated. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number: EN6200) on 20Feb2021 13:00 in left leg by injection for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced nausea, dizzy, face hot, trouble breathing/chest tightness, pain to shot, all on 15Mar2021. Clinical course: Pre treated u/ 50mg Benadryl and 1 Zyrtec. 1hr pain to shot. u/in 15 minutes of shot: Nausea, dizzy, face hot, trouble breathing/chest tightness, given oxygen &#43;2 more Benadryl laid down u/ feet up, discharged 1200HR Sx resolved by next day (24hours). The outcome of the events was recovered on 16Mar2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events nausea and vaccination site pain were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events &#34;face hot, trouble breathing/chest tightness&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8733) via an unspecified route of administration into left arm on 30Mar2021 (at the age of 67-year-old) in the morning as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history were not reported. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccines include: INFLUENZA VACCINE on an unspecified date for immunization where she got sick for a week and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6199) into left arm on 09Mar2021 08:30 AM  (at the age of 67-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization and feeling like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely, hard time breathing when doing anything that was exerting herself, she still had a hard time with her breathing and short of breath. It was reported that patient got her second dose on 30Mar2021 in the morning and on 31Mar2021 almost the same thing pretty much happened as the first one, only it was a lot worse with her lungs and her nose. Her lungs did the same thing where they had closed and her nose did the same thing where it closed as well. She already had everything ready to use for nebulizing and that opened her lungs but it didn&#39;t open her nose. It was further reported that since 31Mar2021 she had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep and she was breathing through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t breathe through her nose. The patient went to her doctor&#39;s clinic where she was given treatment for the events reported; she was put on a heavier nebulizer; that kind of opened up her lungs and her nose and then her doctor also put her on prednisone. Outcome of events &#34;she was breathing through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t breathe through her nose&#34; and &#34;she had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep&#34; was unknown while for all other events was recovering.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 09Mar2021 at 08:30 (batch/lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient has no medical history and no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization and got sick on an unspecified date. No prior vaccination (within 4 weeks prior). No family history related to adverse events. The patient experienced she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely on 09Mar2021. She said that she wanted to let Pfizer know about the symptoms she had gone through when she got the shot. She received her first shot 09Mar2021 and it was at 08:30 am and then around mid-afternoon that same day she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely. She has a nebulizer machine and she used that and it opened up her lungs but it didn&#39;t open her nose up at all. So she sat up for a couple of nights with her nose not working right and she had to breathe out of her mouth. Days later here nose finally opened up and it was breathing good but she still had a hard time with her breathing when she was doing anything that was exerting herself to get things done. She would become short of breath. It was kind of that way when she went in for her second one, she was better at that time but she wasn&#39;t the greatest. When she had went in for second shot and told them about what she experienced after the first shot, they didn&#39;t do anything and they said that was what should be happening which was scary. They gave her the second shot even though she was very reluctant on it and she did it anyways. With that, what she experienced was even worse than what she experienced with the first shot. She got her second shot on 30Mar2021 in the morning and then the same thing pretty much happened as the first one, only it was a lot worse with her lungs and her nose. Her lungs did the same thing where they had closed and her nose did the same thing where it closed as well. She already had everything ready to use for nebulizing and that opened her lungs but it didn&#39;t open her nose for at least 3 days or maybe it took longer for her nose to open. She had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep. She was breathing through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t breathe through her nose. It was a horrible time trying to breathe. It was unreal. It was kind of scary when you&#39;re trying to breathe and you&#39;re not getting any air. She had went to her clinic and she was put on a heavier nebulizer and that that one kind of opened up her lungs and her nose and then her doctor also put her on prednisone. Besides that she was given another nebulizer that wasn&#39;t as harsh or intense for her to use for all of her reactions or if she needed it during the night. Finally she was getting back on the mend now to where at least she can breathe through her nose and her mouth. Her provider thought that she should report this because she just cant figure it out. She knows that when she gets flu shots she gets sick and the same thing happens like now. The first time she got a flu shot she was sick like that for a week and she thought that maybe it was just a fluke so she did it a second time and the same thing happened. With this shot, she didn&#39;t know if she would want to get it again or not but people say that you should so she thought to give it a chance and then it turned out the same way with the second shot. It was not good. She doesn&#39;t know if there was something in those that was not a good thing or her to have or what. She didn&#39;t end up in the hospital even though she was pretty close to going up there. Probed for names, , lot numbers and expiry dates for all previously mentioned medications such as the different nebulizers, prednisone, and the flu shots from previously and she says that they were fairly new, she doesn&#39;t have the box now because she used them and when she was done she tossed it. The products weren&#39;t old and they didn&#39;t have old expiry dates. Probed for information such as , lot number and expiry dates for previously administered flu shots and she declined to provide and said that was many years ago. Provided mailing address and then caller stated that she doesn&#39;t want to be bombarded with anything if it has nothing of importance but she doesn&#39;t want it really. She doesn&#39;t want a lot of stuff to read through if it was not of importance. Informed caller that all information was voluntary in what we ask and she does not have to provide her mailing address was if she was not comfortable doing so and she asked this agent to remove her mailing it&#39;s because she always hears stuff on the news. Caller confirmed that this was her first time speaking to someone about what she has experienced. Probed if her side effects began on the same day she received her vaccine, 09Mar2021 and 30Mar2021 and caller said that for the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 09Mar2021 the side effects started mid-afternoon and for the second dose on 30Mar2021 the side effects started a little later and it wasn&#39;t on the same day. She had started feeling it that day but she really felt them the next day. She could tell it was kind of starting to do it at a slower process but when it happened it was really worse then the first time. Caller confirmed dates of 09Mar2021 and 31Mar2021 for when her side effects began and she says she was still feeling a little bit like she did with the side effects. She still has where if she was doing a little more exertion stuff then it seems like she still was having to sometimes stop and get her breath but it was getting better now. She doesn&#39;t want to go through that again, that was horrible. Caller said it seemed like if you didn&#39;t get the COVID vaccine then you couldn&#39;t go out in public without a mask on for the rest of your life or even if you go to some places, like a concert or an event, if you didn&#39;t have the COVID vaccine then they were going to card you and if you didn&#39;t, you know what. She has a friend who went to get it because he was working and he was around people and she thought that was important too with her being around him and that was the other reason she got the COVID vaccine. She didn&#39;t really want to but she did it anyways. She probably should of just taken her chances and if she got COVID then she got it and it probably wouldn&#39;t be as bad as putting something into her system that doesn&#39;t even like her. It was hard. That was just how she was feeling. It was a bad thing, you know. Her mom couldn&#39;t (well, she has been gone since 2000) but anyways, her mom could never get flu shots either years ago. The caller doesn&#39;t know if there was something with that that she doesn&#39;t know. All she knew was that these shots don&#39;t like her. Probed for relevant test results, concomitant products and medical conditions and caller says no, she was not sick and she didn&#39;t take anything before. She wasn&#39;t sick, if she was sick she would have thought that maybe she felt like not from the sock but she didn&#39;t feel sick. She takes her temperature every day and she has been for the better part of this whole last year and she never had a fever. She couldn&#39;t take her temperature during all this because she couldn&#39;t breathe when her mouth was shut. She said that the only thing what she doesn&#39;t really understand was that if you can still get COVID after getting the shots, then why were people still doing the shots. It just makes her wonder why was everything doing something like this and it can still happen. To her it didn&#39;t really make sense. After she found out that you can still get COVID after this thing she thought well what&#39;s the point. She just thought that she would let Pfizer know about what she experienced and that this was a lot worse than when she had the flu shot with the side effects. The flu shot was minor compared to this thing, the COVID vaccines, she felt like she almost could of died. This was most definitely by far a lot worse. She would rather have the flu shot and have a minor thing than this one this was bad. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it or what caused her to have this total reaction where she couldn&#39;t breath and it was bad. She really doesn&#39;t want to do this again either. She doesn&#39;t know if there was something in this one or whatever, but it doesn&#39;t like her big time. She doesn&#39;t know if Pfizer has heard of this where people had trouble breathing after they got this done but she kind of wonders. She listens to the news and on there you don&#39;t really hear any side effects caused or how people are dealing with the symptoms. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. Vaccination facility, it was a clinic, well it was between that and the hospital that was connected to the clinic so kind of right inside the hospital area going to clinic, maybe it was the hospital. The adverse events required a visit to a physician&#39;s office because she got to the point to where she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was even having trouble walking across the parking lot so she ended up going in because she couldn&#39;t breathe. No relevant tests done. The outcome of the events &#34;she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely&#34; was recovering and unknown for the other event.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

The patient was at her eye doctor on 02Apr2021 and decided afterwards to have her grandson take her to the Emergency Room (ER) for some tightening and uneasiness she had been having in her chest over the preceding days. She also felt some palpitations, they were fast, then slowed down; did not feel labored. She went to the ER and was there for 8 hours. They told her that her cardiac enzymes were extremely elevated.  After the cardiologist reviewed her results she was allowed to go home. She went to her regular cardiologist on 05Apr2021. That cardiologist went over her tests results and said that while it was not normal results for her he didn&#39;t find them too worrisome. He stated that just because her enzymes are elevated does not mean she is in trouble. He scheduled her for a Dobutamine Stress Test on 07Apr2021. She has been trying to get the results of this stress test from the doctor&#39;s office but has not been successful in doing so. Says that once she completed the Stress Test on 07Apr2021 she went to get her second dose of the Covid Vaccine. She was still having her symptoms when she got her second vaccine and they have continued since. She saw her endocrinologist who went over blood work with her. The endocrinologist told her that her blood glucose level was very good and her A1c was a 5.5.  The endocrinologist was concerned because usually the A1c is between 6 and 7.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

                                                After 15 minutes felt light headed and throat started to constrict slightly.  Had an Allegra with me, so took it.  Seemed to subside in about 30 minutes.  Took a benedryl at bedtime.  In morning, seemed ok, though took another benedryl.  Seemed OK on this next day, but before bed, face was puffy, then woke up at 3:50 a.m. Saturday, and throat glands swollen and was having difficulty swallowing.

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 1/21/21 for evaluation of SOB stating her husband tested positive for COVID earlier that week and she has been around him. The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Called my PCP and left message.  Coughed an asthmatic cough Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. On Monday, Feb. 8 called PCP again. We had a virtual visit.  He said, it was not an allergic reaction.  He prescribed Prednisone and Alburetol inhaler.  On Thursday Feb . 11 I got a rash all over my body that came and went and I got Hives on the palms of my hands. Virtual visit with  my PCP. He said that he retracted his statement from Monday and evidently I was having a reaction to the Vaccine.  I kept taking the Steroid which I finished on Monday.  The rash and hives bothered me till  Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday rash and hives gone.  On Thursday morning I woke up with a burning pain across my left side of my chest to the backside and pain on my knees.  On Friday the pain was also on the backside of my waist.  It felt like shingles.  Went to see the NP at Dr. office.   They don&#39;t think I have shingles.  This is all still a reaction to the vaccine.

Then it went down to my lungs and my lungs really hurt . I do have asthma so maybe that?s a part of it? It just seems strange that I was coughing so much and gave me a headache. Then about six days later I got an attack of IBS. I haven?t had an attack  like that for two years. Maybe it?s all a coincidence? Also about 3-4 days after shot I had a herpes outbreak.

She was coherent and verbalizing the entire time.  She was observed while 911 was called.  She stated she was feeling better and her symptoms were resolving as she sat for 10 minutes.  She was taken to a different facility ER for assessment (Kaiser).  When we spoke to her later at night, she was home and said she did not receive any treatment while at the ER.

                                                Beginning 3 days after my vaccination I began to experience chest pain and tightness sporadically throughout the day and night for the next 5 days.  No fever. Then at the end of those 5 days, it seemed my lungs, right one in particular, had pain and I developed a cough.  I had a small amount of pain when breathing, especially breathing in.  It felt very similar to an episode of Pleurisy I had quite a few years ago.  I do have seasonal allergies and had been sneezing off and on in the days previous to the vaccination and also afterward.  Symptoms have since lessened considerably and have almost disappeared.  I am curious to know if this was in any way related to the vaccination, or purely coincidental.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My face was flushed and my throat began to tighten a little  The headache and flush lasted about an hour.  (I had taken Tylenol right after getting the vaccine.)  The throat symptoms lasted longer ,lessening slightly after about an hour and a half.  Never had trouble breathing, talking, eating or drinking.  But the feeling has lasted into the late evening to a very mild degree; as if something is caught at the back of the throat, or the back of the tongue feels a little fuzzy.

By the end of the day, because of chest pain and dizziness my doctor sent me to the ER. I was then referred to a cardiologist, who indicated he thinks these symptoms are from the second dose of vaccine. He has seen several patients with the same symptoms after the second vaccine dose. My family doctor now thinks the same thing for the same reasons.

EMS evaluated the patient on-site. Patient was hypertensive (173/92). EMS administered 50mg Benadryl IV and 2L Oxygen via nasal canula. Given past medical history of allergic reactions, EMS transported the patient to  Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient remained hypertensive. EKG demonstrated NSR, rate 75bom, no ST-T changes, no ectopy, and normal PR &amp; QRS intervals. Blood work was unremarkable. After administration of Benadryl the patient noted improvement of their hives and was discharged with a diagnosis of allergic reaction secondary to COVID vaccine that caused acute hives.

                                                Almost immediate fatigue that lasted about 5 hours.  Slight headache.  Later that night while sleeping I woke up and could not breathe and my chest hurt.  It lasted about 15-20 minutes.  I would like to know if it is safe for me to take the second dose as I have heard from friends that it was a little bit more difficult if you had side effects.

The patient reported having a hot face and neck was flushed, after the vaccine, she stated she had tingling in her tongue, lips, and face. And she stated her throat felt tight also, her lips were puffy, and a lot of heat of neck and face, thought she was starting to shake. The patient reported the pharmacist gave EpiPen in thigh and 20 mg tablet of Benadryl and called 911, and took her to the local hospital. Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets.

She has two Epi Pens from the drug store that was prescribed but she was afraid to use it, and she thought to see what happens if she uses the Benadryl. She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store. Patient reported she was given prednisone IV in hand through IV at ER, she doesn&#39;t know how much that was, then was given Prednisone to go home with- 20mg tablets take 2 a day for 4 days, which she started Sunday morning, 07Mar2021. She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

                                                A few days after my shot I started feeling very tired and groggy.  My head was dizzy most of the day.  Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.  I also have head aches but they seem to have improved as the weeks have gone by, especially since I have been taking Aleve every day.  I am unable to exercise and have very little energy still.  The dizzy head continues to persist even  6 weeks out.  I had this same kind of dizzy head in August when I had Covid but it went away in a week or two.  I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.  Will it ever get better?  I can&#39;t stand to go on like this!

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: CER230) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The medical history included flu and suspected COVID-19 both in Jan2020 to an unspecified date (she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID because it was such a bad flu, over a year ago), ongoing asthma from an unspecified date (mild asthma) and chest nausea in Jan2020 to an unspecified date. The patient had no history of any adverse events following prior vaccinations. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event included an uncle that had asthma, but no one else had breathing issues. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), both ongoing and taken for asthma on unspecified dates. Other products were also reported as &#34;no&#34;. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine and did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: 3N6202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and headache; on 25Mar2021 the patient experienced flu-like symptoms, fever, achy, fatigue; on 02Apr2021 the patient experienced asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest, nausea feeling in her chest; on unspecified dates in Apr2021 the patient experienced she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia. The reporter classified the events headache and flu-like symptoms as non-serious. The patient called to report that she had an asthma flare up 10 days (as reported) after her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 24Mar2021. The patient stated that she did not get a flare up often, she had mild asthma. She usually got mild flare-ups since she did not have severe asthma. She stated it could be something else, but she had not had a flare-up like this since she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID-19 because it was such a bad flu. That was over a year ago. She received her second vaccine on 24Mar2021, and the asthma flare up and hacking cough started on 02Apr2021. On the night of 24Mar2021, she started with a headache. She had the shot at 11 something and by that evening before she went to bed, she had a headache and a sore arm, but that was no big deal. Then on 25Mar2021, she started with flu like symptoms/fever. The headache persisted through that as well. At that point, she did not have tightness or the dry, hacky cough. By the middle of the day on 27Mar2021, her flu-like symptoms were gone. She would consider these to be &#34;non-serious&#34;, it was what she expected, as it was seen from the paperwork of the vaccine. By 28Mar2021, all of her symptoms were gone prior to the flare-up. She had typical flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, achy, fatigue on the 2nd, 3rd, and into the 4th day but then they cleared up. By the evening of the 4th day, she started feeling fairly normal. She stated that they were mild flu symptoms. Her temperature was only 100 for about a day. She stated that that was expected. Then, she went into this flare-up about the 10th day after the vaccine. The first 3 or 4 days after the flare up began, the flare up was worsening. Then, she got it under a little bit of control, so she was not coughing all night and having to sit up as she was sleeping. Now, she was concerned about the pain and tightness in her chest and the hacky cough. She wanted to make sure it was not going into like a viral pneumonia or another thing. She did not know. She kept increasing her Advair use and was at the top of that. She was doing the duoneb which she did not usually have to do. She had not had to do that since Jan2020 when she had the 5-week flu, or it could have been COVID (they were calling it a hoax back then). She was using her duoneb 4 times a day and now she was using it to 2-3 times, but she was still getting chest tightness, hacky cough. It was kind of like nausea- it was hard to explain, it was kind of like a chest nausea, which she had also had back in Jan2020 when she had the bad flu. She also would get this laryngitis and had trouble talking. With her flare-up, her chest tightness/nausea feeling in the chest continued. Now, she was getting into laryngitis type of thing, but she could loosen that up with her duoneb but if she got to the point where she could not do that, she would definitely have to see someone right away. She clarified that when her chest got tight, the dry, hacky cough continued/increased. When she did the breathing treatment, it loosened it up for about 3-4 hours and some of the pain would go away in her chest. If she talked too much, she would begin to cough. She had had this flare up 3 times in her life, it was not very common. She was diagnosed with asthma in her 40s, and this was her 3rd time ever having anything like this. This was the first time she had experienced a flare up like this. She had had 3 episodes since she had had asthma in her 40&#39;s and all 3 bad episodes were about the same. All the episodes were related to illness, it did not just happen out of the blue. It happened with a viral respiratory thing or the flu. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient stated that she would call her physician or the clinic &#34;today or tomorrow&#34;. She had not been to a doctor since her asthma flared up. Her respiratory doctor/pulmonologist moved away, there was no respiratory doctor nearby right now. So, her general practitioner was following her because it was a mild case and she had mild asthma. If it was severe, her doctor would make her go to a specialist. Relevant tests were reported as no. The patient used to be followed with pulmonary function tests until her respiratory doctor moved away. The patient stated that she took care of her 94 year old mother several days a week and because of all of the variances coming out, she thought it was her civic duty to prevent it from spreading through the population and creating more variances which was why she received the vaccine. She stated her doses were scheduled a month apart because they expecting to get a shipment of Moderna and they did not. They had to run to Buffalo to get the Pfizer vaccine, but they left her doses scheduled a month apart because the appointments were so hard to get. Normally, it would be 3 weeks. Her card clearly said Pfizer and they told her Pfizer, and they told her the reason for it being scheduled at 4 weeks. The patient called to inquire whether asthma flare-ups had been seen in clinical trials. It was not a reported side effect from the paperwork she received. When she looked online, she could not really find anything. She was thinking of going to a clinic but was wondering if there were any reports of flare-ups with asthma with the vaccine. With regards to causality, the patient stated it was a concern because she usually did not get a flare-up unless she was sick. She stated that there were many variables, and that it was spring, and bugs were out, but she did not usually get a flare-up like this. She stated that maybe it was a challenge to her immune system, the antibodies, but she did not know. She suspected the flare-up was related to the vaccine, but she did not have any idea. She would say yes, but she had no way of knowing. The flare-up usually only appeared if she got ill or something weird happened to her.  The clinical outcomes of the events flu-like symptoms, fever, achy and fatigue were recovered/resolved on 27Mar2021; sore arm and headache were recovered/resolved on 28Mar2021; asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were not recovered/not resolved; she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia were unknown. The reporter believed there was a reasonable possibility that the events sore arm, flu-like symptoms, asthma flare-up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were related to BNT162B2.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information the events asthma flare-ups and viral pneumonia are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, unlikely related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 14:40 (lot number: EW0150) at age of 68 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low vitamin D, lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and asthma attacks. Concomitant medications included vitamin D2 and D3 and regular vitamins for low vitamin D, had been taking that for 6-7 weeks, tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT) 2.5mcg takes 2 inhales a day in the morning and salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR) 2 puffs and a special medication because her lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and put her on an asthma medication to open her lungs. Patient got a flu shot every year and got it in Jan2021 and nothing. Patient stated that her symptoms were mild. Patient stated on day 1 after she got the shot she had nothing, that was 07Apr2021. Stated the next day (08Apr2021) she did not have injection site soreness but 2 inches below the injection site the muscle was hard and swollen and sore and remained that way for days 2, 3 and about day 4 it started to recede and day 7 it was tender. Stated it was one muscle and it was below the injection site, not at the injection site. Stated it was a lifting muscle, if she lifted her arm up it could only go so far and she would feel it and drop her arm down. Stated she got the injection in her left arm as she used it the least. Stated on days 2 (09Apr2021), 3 and 4 she had weakness with climbing stairs and with exertion, she could do it but she would notice it was more of a struggle. Stated that today she was off kilter again. Patient relayed that she looked all over online to see if she was sick with something. Stated she was tired on days 3 (10Apr2021) and 4 and that on days 5 (12Apr2021) and 6 she had tons of energy and she worked from dawn to dusk waxing floors and never has that much energy when she was normal. Stated that all of a sudden on day 5 and 6 she was perfect and then toward the evening of day 6 she thought it was her as she had to go to the Secretary of States and stand in line to renew her license and she did well and got home and started feeling tired. States she woke up last night of day 6 (13Apr2021) with a burning in her stomach and a stomach ache and it woke her and made her feel like she had food poisoning or something like that and nothing happened and she took 2 Tums and it kind of settled that down. Stated on day 7 (14Apr2021) she woke up and the stomach part was gone and all of a sudden she got really really hot, she runs about 97-97.4 and she got so hot and her face got really red like she had a high fever and she was 99.2, which is not much for most people but she feels and she took Motrin and after that she still feels a heaviness in her eyes and her temperature is 98.6 and she is normally in the 97&#39;s and was running a 2 degree fever and now maybe a 1 degree fever and she felt it in her eyes and didn&#39;t feel sick. Stated she felt fatigued like she want to take a nap but didn&#39;t feel ill. Stated whatever was going on was zapping her energy. Stated she woke up on day 4 (11Apr2021) in the middle of the night and her lungs were pinching, pinching, pinching, like an asthma attack and she couldn&#39;t stop it and she had to get her old fashioned inhaler to stop it. Stated this hadn&#39;t happened and she had been taking the special medication for 3 weeks now and it was very rare for her to get those attacks and this was worse than any. Patient relayed that today all day even with the special medication to open her lungs she can feel in her lungs that they were, she can&#39;t explain it, like they are gripping and releasing and gripping and releasing a little but. Stated she knew she was having some kind of asthma thing going on, it was not making her cough it was making her lungs hypersensitive. Stated she was expecting everything and she did read and nobody had symptoms that last more than 7 days and she was expecting them to be gone tomorrow, or she hopeed anyways. Stated the last 10 days had been easy-peasy and all of a sudden she was waking with all that coughing like something was irritating her lungs and she can&#39;t stop. Patient provided that it woke her husband up with her coughing for half an hour. States this lasted half an hour and was more than normal and something really irritated her lungs, shouldn&#39;t have happened as she is on the other thing every day and has not had an attack with that. Patient stated her provider didn&#39;t know as it was so relatively minor and was unusual but minor and she did not feel like it was life threatening. Stated her brother had Covid and she did not feel like she was trying to breathe and couldn&#39;t, or suffocating and dying. She did not feel that. The air irritated to even breathe and made her cough and couldn&#39;t stop and that was the first time she had to use an inhaler on top of on inhaler and something made her lungs respond to nothing there. Stated it may be her immune system thinking something was there, the headless thing in her lungs. Patient stated she thought she was over it and then got the fever not understanding if the fever was Covid related and she stayed at home and didn&#39;t go out until yesterday it was the 1st day out since Thursday and how could she have caught anything if she wasn&#39;t near anybody. Stated these were just thoughts in her head. Outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of asthma aggravated was assessed as possibly related based on temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for AE. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, ethics committees and investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204) at single dose on 20Mar2021 14:54 injected in left arm in the muscle for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included shortness of breath, hypothyroidism and COVID-19 back in Dec2020. She had some food allergies that were diagnosed prior to getting the vaccine. Patient was tested positive for COVID on 21Dec2020 and negative on 20Jan2021. The symptoms followed for patient was a little coughing and no smell for 3 days and a little shortness of breath.  Family medical history was none. Concomitant drug included levothyroxine 0.75 ug, once daily for hypothyroidism, which was taking for 15 years (as of 19Apr2021). No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient experienced left arm painful on 20Mar2021 about an hour or two after she got the injection, did not have much energy on 21Mar2021 08:00, foggy and not clear from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021 08:00, shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021, and hyperventilation on an unknown date in Mar2021 (reported as a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine). The shortness of breath was what she referred to as hyperventilating.  That came a week after the vaccine. The same date they took shot was when the arm pain started and the low energy was the day after. Foggy and not being clear was from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021. Shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021.  In additional to shortness of breath, she had been hyperventilating.  That began approximately a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine. Left arm was painful and it got swollen a bit and lasted for 48 hours. The husband experienced arm pain and said he almost had a fever and felt fatigued.  The reporter thinks patient (his wife) felt the same.  She had arm pain and not much energy. They came out of that ok.  About a week after the first injection, she just cannot catch her breath.  She started hyperventilating to the point where the husband thought she would expire.  She also experienced being foggy and not clear and having no energy.  First, she went to a Cardiologist and he said there was nothing wrong.   She then saw a lung doctor who send for respiratory chest and did chest CT scans and everything was clear on both test.  He did not prescribe any medications. A week after she saw him, she went to the ER on 31Mar2021for hyperventilation and shortness of breath.  They prescribed Xanax (AER 2021434900).  She said it did not work and they prescribed something else. It was 25 mg twice a day which was in a pharmacy vial.  They then prescribed Lorazepam. She was afraid to take it.  She took one instead of two. The dose was 0.25 mg twice daily.  The ER did CT scan of chest with Contrast.  It was negative for thromboembolism (also reported as CAT scan&#39;s negative for blood clots). She had shortness of breath before the vaccination and it got worse. She was managing it though.  Outcome of left arm painful, foggy and not clear, did not have much energy/having no energy/low energy was resolving. Outcome of shortness of breath and hyperventilation was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Asthmas/having asthma attacks; bronchitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information team and Pfizer sponsored program, Pfizer First Connect. A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history  included asthma. Concomitant medication includes a bunch of medications for asthma. The patient had her first dose of COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. The patient said that she does have asthma anyway and her asthma goes into bronchitis in 2021 very quickly. So she was just put on Prednisone. She is wondering if she can start Prednisone and an antibiotic for her asthma. The patient already had asthma but she is starting Prednisone and an antibiotic. And antibiotic is not something that she normally takes. The patient stated, &#34;I took the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, the first dose and I am having a bad asthma attack (in Jan2021) and I don&#39;t know what my doctor put me on, wanted me to take Prednisone and an antibiotic (Unspecified Medication). The patient ask, &#34;Can I take those after taking the vaccine?&#34; The patient was asked about treatment for the event and stated, &#34;Not until 2 days but right now I am having one. I just want to know if I can take Prednisone and antibiotic to get rid of this. Just my regular asthma medications that I am taking. My Albuterol inhaler, my Nebulizer and that&#39;s it.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

                                                The patient was referred by her primary care provider&#39;s office to receive COVID-19 vaccination. She received her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 15:07 hrs. Due to her history of allergic reactions to multiple medications (including sulfa antibiotics and ceftriaxone), she was advised to extend her monitoring period to at least 30 minutes post-injection. At around 15:50 hrs I was notified that the patient was feeling a tingling sensation in her throat, itching, and a change in her voice. She was transferred to a stretcher for acute management of suspected anaphylaxis. Airway, breathing, circulation, and mentation were assessed immediately. EMS was called immediately via 911. Her vital signs were obtained, with a BP 168/90 mm/Hg, HR 105/min, RR 24/min. She reported shortness of breath at the time. There was no stridor or wheezing on exam. She appeared in mild respiratory distress. At 15:54 hrs she was given an intramuscular EpiPen injection (0.3 mg autoinjector) in her left thigh. At 15:58 she was given an intramuscular methylprednisolone injection (125 mg) in her right thigh. Immediately after that EMS team arrived and took over her care with plans to administer diphenhydramine intramuscularly, and will transfer to ED for further management. Throughout the event the patient remained awake, alert, and fully oriented.

                                                I received my first COVID19 at around 5:00 p.m.  at Walgreens.  I was asked to remain in the store for 15 minutes.  By the time I got home, at around 5:25 p.m., I was feeling woozy, my neck was red (flushed), I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth, I was very thirsty, and I felt that my throat was somewhat constricted.  I immediately took a Benadryl.  (I knew to do this because I had done this when I had an allergic reaction to penicillin years ago.   By about an hour later I felt alright and the redness on my neck had almost faded away.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                One week after Vaccine #1 I began to have swelling &amp; itching of the face-eyes, lips and cheeks, extreme itching of both hands, massive diarrhea and some difficulty swallowing. I took oral benadryl (50 mg) and prednisone (@ 50 mg) and applied cold packs to my face and hands. I also took Allegra 180 mg LA 2x/daily for two weeks after the reaction. Vaccine dose 2 was administered on 2/17/2021 (Pfizer, Lot # EN6201) at Hospital, . One week after that (2/25/2021) I again had facial swelling and itching and massive diarrhea. I took Benadryl 25 mg and Allegra 2x/day and continue to do so.  The facial swelling/itching continued.             In addition I had, since the first vaccine, extreme fatigue, resulting in a decrease in my ability to walk (down from 3 miles to just over 1 mile) and to swim (shortness of breath, reduction in ability to swim laps). I visited my Rheumatologist on 3/2/2021 and he administered an injection of methylprednisolone to try and tamp down the continuing reaction. That seems to have made a difference.

                                                On 3/24, I woke up nauseous, extremely fatigued, with sore joints, headache, and abdominal pain.  A few days later I noticed I had extreme shortness of breath.  I went to see my PCP on or about 3/31.  He listened to my heart and discovered a rapid heartbeat.  He then took an EKG.  He wanted to put me on lifetime meds immediately.  I was in shock because I truly believe this is a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  I have never had arrhythmia.  In fact, I had a wellness visit with the Dr. about 3 months previously and all was good.  I have been seeing him for four years since I moved.  He does not think my new diagnosis is related to a vaccine reaction, but I find it highly suspect that 4 other women in my large circle of friends also have AFIB after 2nd shot. I spent Easter in the ER and they pumped Metoprolol in my bloodstream.  I did not stay in the hospital that night.  I went to see the Dr. on Monday morning on 4/4.  He prescribed Metroprolol 25 mg and Xarelto 20 mg IMMEDIATELY.  I picked up the meds and started this regimen.  In speaking with other women, I believe this terrible diagnosis is a direct result as a reaction from the vaccine.

                                                it&#39;ll feel like little flutters; Heart palpitations; Shortness of breath; Didn&#39;t feel like normal self; Site pain; Chest pressure; Difficulty sleeping because of heart rate; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 29Mar2021 at 09:20 (at the age of 69-year-old) at hospital facility as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no relevant medical history. Patient reported that she has people in the family that have had heart problems. Concomitant medication included unspecified vitamins. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9990 or EM9890) administered in the right arm on 08Mar2021 (at the age of 69-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and had a little fast heart rate but not constant, little fatigue and site pain. The patient previously took steroid injections 2 years ago (2019) and had heart palpitations before. The patient further mentioned that normally after the steroids wear off, the heart palpitations go away. The patient reported that she did not have any problems following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she had a little fatigue and site pain for just a couple of days but that everything was fine. Patient reported that she felt a little heart palpitations for maybe a day or two and then it was gone following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, she noticed the heart palpitations again and a little shortness of breath. The heart palpitations and shortness of breath were nothing that she felt that she had to run to the emergency room or anything over. The patient reported that now it was getting difficult for her to sleep sometimes at night because of the heart rate. The patient also reported that she was trying to figure out that from this length of time between her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021 and time of call on 14Apr2021, could the heart palpitations be a side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient also mentioned that when she experienced heart palpitations before, a whole work up was ordered and she was referred to cardiology and that nothing was found during the work up after previous experience with heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that she has been fine, that she has been able to work and walk and that she gets her 10,000 steps every day. After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, she was tired and didn&#39;t feel like her normal self. The patient also reported that when the time had arrived to get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, about a week before, she may have had a little fast heart rate but not constant. It was also reported that following her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, the fatigue started about the same time as it did following the first dose, on the second day post-vaccine on 30Mar2021. Patient reported that she was kind of tired and just taking a nap during the day. The fatigue was still ongoing. It was also reported that patient was starting to feel better other than the heart palpitations. The patient reported that yesterday, 13Apr2021, she felt great and could do her normal routine, other than feeling chest pains and palpitations. The heart palpitations are not constant, but are more regular during the day than she was used to. The heart palpitations were really bad last night, 13Apr2021, and that she had difficulty sleeping because of heart rate (couldn&#39;t hardly sleep at all). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for an echocardiogram. The patient&#39;s doctor did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on her on 08Apr2021 and there was nothing there (normal). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for a stress echocardiogram. The patient also mentioned that after returning from the physician&#39;s office, her husband went back and looked at the symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine information sheet. The patient reported that her husband thought that she needed to call to eliminate everything, that they are trying to figure out why the patient was experiencing the heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that 2 days ago she got on her treadmill to walk and went for 30 minutes. Patient reported that it normally takes her 5 minutes to recuperate, but that time it took her 20 minutes before she felt comfortable after her walk. The patient also reported that the site pain was nothing serious following both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The site pain began shortly after receiving the vaccine and went away after the second day following both vaccines. The shortness of breath probably started about 5 days after she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The shortness of breath wasn&#39;t enough that she felt that she needed to run to the emergency room. It just felt like when she would breathe, especially at night as she normally breathes with her mouth closed at night, the patient felt like she had to open her mouth to breathe because she can still feel the pressure in chest. The patient was still experiencing the heart palpitations. The heart palpitations are a little worse because they happen so often. Patient reported that initially, she would have a few heart palpitations and then go for hours with none. Patient reported that now, she was feeling the heart palpitations quite a bit. Patient reported that it feels kind of like a little pressure in her chest and then it&#39;ll feel like little flutters. The patient further reported that she experiences a little pressure in her chest when she experiences the heart palpitations. At times, the chest pressure would go away, but she always feels the chest pressure there now. The chest pressure has gotten worse over the past couple of weeks and that she was thinking that it would go away like the first one did. Patient reported that she went to the doctor last week and was given an EKG. Patient reported that the EKG was fine and that her physician was scheduling other tests to make sure it&#39;s nothing with her heart. The patient didn&#39;t think that the heart palpitations and shortness of breath were from the COVID-19 vaccine, but that her husband looked at the vaccine information paper after her doctor&#39;s appointment and said she should call Pfizer. The patient had not yet recovered from heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pressure while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                A little after midnight, I woke up shaking because I was so very cold.  It felt almost like a seizure because my lack of control was evident in my movements.  With my heaviest PJs on, it took 8 blankets to finally warm me up.  I am on a CPAP machine but I was having a hard time getting my breath.  I was also nauseous but never threw up.  I finally got back asleep a little after 3 am but  woke several times after that.  This morning, I had a terrible headache and can&#39;t get rid of it. Although I feel better than last night, I feel lousy.  It is now 2 pm and I just want this to be over.  On the first shot, I didn&#39;t have any reaction at all.

                                                Patient was alert and conversational throughout first COVID-19 Pfizer vaccination. During post vaccination waiting period, patient became unresponsive and exhibited convulsion like movements in her waiting chair. Pharmacist quickly evaluated patient and patient was only minimally responsive to painful stimuli only. Breathing was rapid, shallow, and irregular with an expiratory wheeze heard upon auscultation. Patient was slouched in chair but supporting self and had a strong grip with her left hand. Skin condition was warm but diaphoretic. Ambulance 911 service was called. No swelling of the throat, mouth, face, nor lips was seen. Patient continued to be non-responsive, with non-comprehensible sounds, and was not opening eyes or following commands. Due to worsening ability to breath and wheezing on expiration, epinephrine 0.3 mg was administered intramuscularly into the left thigh at 1230 on 2/25/2021. Approximately 5 minutes after epinephrine administration, the patient?s work of breathing improved, wheezing was diminished upon expiration, and respiratory rate had slowed to 16 breaths per minutes. BP was 160s/80s and HR 98 (after epinephrine administration). Patient began opening eyes spontaneously but was still not following commands. Ambulance service then arrived, report was given, and patient was transported to Hospital Emergency Department.   Patient was under the care of Doctor at the emergency department and received albuterol/ipratropium nebulization, dexamethasone 10 mg Iv, famotidine 20 mg IV, and magnesium sulfate 2 g IV. After the physician evaluated the patient and talked with family, the patient?s family stated that the patient has a history of anxiety related reactions such as this with convulsion like activity. Doctor then determined that the patient did not have an anaphylactic/allergic reaction and instead had a anxiety related vasovagal type reaction. Doctor stated that the patient could receive the second COVID-19 vaccine dose in 3 weeks without issue. Patient then discharged from Emergency Department (unsure if AMA). Patient then presented to the pharmacy with her daughter after discharge to fill in staff on the outcome of the reaction. Patient appeared to be at baseline mentally and physically. Pharmacist contacted Emergency Department to discuss case with patient?s nurse to obtain information about medications received in the emergency department. Patient daughter stated that she would like to be present for second dose of vaccine to help avoid a similar anxiety related reaction from occurring.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

                                                Seven or so hours after injection on Saturday, I developed a rash that quickly became hives on my lower back, which spread to my inner thighs.  Took Benadryl OTC tablets, and used Benadryl topical gel on affected areas.  Overnight, the rash spread to my outer thighs.  By about 9am the next day, (Sunday) developed a headache which became more severe as the day wore on, a fever (102), and, body aches.  Talked with my primary care manager on Sunday afternoon who advised me to continued with my benadryl treatment, but to go to the ER if I developed any breathing problems.  This all persisted in varying stages of severity through Tuesday, when I started having breathing issues, and went to the ER, where I was given steroids and a breathing treatment, chest xray, blood tests, etc.  Was also given a prescription for five days of prednizone, and, released.

                                                Two hours after injection, I began wheezing. Four hours after injection, the wheezing worsened, the inside of my mouth started itching, and I had abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. These symptoms lessened the next day but continued for one week.   I did not report these reactions immediately, as I did not want them to prevent my receiving the second covid vaccine dose. Also, if the second covid vaccine dose started to cause the same type of reaction, I was prepared to use two Epi Pens and call 9-1-1. Fortunately, the second dose caused only a sore arm.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number EN6205) via unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not provided. Upon 15 minutes after injection, she noted nausea with belching and had some SOB. Symptoms worsened as she ambulated over to the medical bay along with her chest pressure. She denied rash, hives, welts, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Patient reported recently admitted for unstable angina and CAD with tachycardia. Patient had elevated d-dimer and blood clot was ruled out. Patient discontinued on new medication, beta blocker. Since discharge this Sunday 21Feb2021, she reported chest heaviness as if she has &#34;cardboard on chest.&#34; Can slightly increase with going up and down stairs or increased activity. She states she had reached out to her cardiologist via an online site but has not heard back. Patient stated her pain is about the same today. Patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath. The outcome of events was unknown.   No Follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events unstable angina and tachycardia cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s age and suspected cardiac condition are risk factors. The event CAD, given its progressive nature, is most likely an underlying condition, thus unrelated to the suspect drug.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 70-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included viruses, flus (I have had viruses, flus my whole life), five surgeries, gallbladder removed, and asthma, all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) on an unspecified date, at the age of 70-years-old and experienced a very sore arm. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient experienced, &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34;. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;I wanted to call today because I got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 3 weeks ago, 03Feb2021 it was. After the first dose I had a very sore arm and that was it. It was more sore than normal vaccine, but it was that was all I had. After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 10Feb2021, 12:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s Hypothyroidism from 2000 (had it at least five years before a diagnosis), allergies year-round, depression, pneumonia, wheezing, calcium deficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) taken for Hashimoto&#39;s Hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date and ongoing; bupropion hcl (BUPROPION HCL) taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing; loratadine (LORATADINE) taken for allergies year round from an unspecified start date and ongoing; aspartate calcium, aspartate zinc, calcium ascorbate, glucosamine sulfate, magnesium aspartate, manganese aspartate (BONE STRENGTH) taken for calcium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; carbinoxamine maleate (OMEGA 100), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3), chondroitin sulfate, collagen, glucosamine (COLAGEN) taken for an unspecified indications from an unspecified start dates and ongoing. When she was older the patient was given the high dose Flu Vaccine and had this reaction where her arm was red from shoulder down to elbow. After that she told them not to give her the high dose Flu Vaccine. She gets the regular Flu Vaccine. She assumes it occurred year turned 65, but was not sure. She does not have a lot/exp/NDC to provide. The patient experienced arm started hurting and very tired (around 7:00-7:30), very thirsty (had to drink three tall glasses of water back to back, reported she was never that thirsty), one of legs got weak (for a brief moment one of her legs was very weak and noticed while walking from the living room to the bed room) and achy on 10Feb2021. It was reported that the patient took a bath with Epsom Salt and it id not help. She got in bed by 8PM. Normally she goes to bed around 9:30-10 PM, but she was very tired. She then followed up and stated she went to sleep after the news about 10:20.  Then at 4:45 AM she woke up  because her eyes were very dry. Stated she has a humidifier in the apartment and usually has no trouble with her eyes, but they were very dry. She also noticed her ribs were hurting and it was noticeable on 11Feb2021. She was also more achy, but it the ribs hurting did not last real long. Then she noticed she was wheezing (11Feb2021). She knows she was wheezing because she has had pneumonia in the past and had wheezing then. The wheezing she had after the vaccine was not real bad. It stopped after about 10-15 minutes or so. She had laid down in bed for a while then got up around 5:30 AM. She felt better around then, but it took until like around 8AM before she felt fully okay as her arm was still aching. The outcome of the event arm started hurting and achy  was recovered on 12Feb2021; eyes dry, ribs hurting and wheezing recovered on 11Feb2021; thirst and muscular weakness recovered on 10Feb2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

                                                About five hours after receiving the vaccine my ears started to ring. At the same time I felt a rush of heat through my body and I became short of breath. But I experience shortness of breath quite often with my asthma so this is not unusual. But the tinnitus has not gone away after over two weeks ofter receiving the shot. I am worried it will get worse if I have a second shot.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Blood pressure top number was 175, ten minutes later it dropped to 155. Staff member stated my pulse was elevated. Although, I only felt the slight tightness in my throat. My oxygen level stayed at 98. They had me stay for an hour and then I went home. By then the tightness started to lessen. After an hour or two the feeling was total gone. My blood pressure had gone back to normal when I checked it at home. The next day at 2 pm [13 hours later] I had a temperature of 99.1, had the chills yet felt warm, started a slight headache and became very tired. At 2 am in the morning everything was over. I woke at my normal time and felt great. Have been doing well ever since.

                                                I walk 3 miles everyday. I went out for my walk around 4 pm  and after walking about 10 minutes I realized I was short of breath this increased the longer I continued to walk. I have never had it happen before and I believe it is a side effect of the vaccine. I walked the next day and though I was still short of breath it was not as severe.

This was followed by red flushing to the skin on the face and left neck, shoulder &amp; hip pain.  BP initially was 182/98 which is elevated for me.  Felt disoriented &amp; very unwell.  Over the next few days, low BP was noted @90/62, pulse 58.  This occurred intermittently.

After 30 minutes, I was released, though still had those symptoms the rest of that day. The EMT at the site thought I&#39;d had a mild allergic response. 36 hours after the shot, I woke up itching a lot on my head, trunk, and arms. I saw no obvious rash (maybe a little mottling) or hives. I used a small dab of Benadryl cream on the itchiest spot. The symptoms disappeared  pretty soon.

This 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 21Jan2021 at single dose (Lot # EL8982) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included stated, the only thing was got the susceptible to blood clots, had that gene so that is one of the reasons took the vaccine other than that did not take any meds. The patient didn&#39;t even take any blood thinners because did not need them.&#34; (not clarified further). No concomitant therapy included. The patient did not know if it is the vaccine but she got really weird smell and then her lips and her tongue were all this kind of swelled and then like it was steamed. The patient stated, &#34;In the tongue and my lips, it was like when you get chilli on them and a distinct type of smell. &#34; And then her arm, both of her arms went numb and she had like sort of a hard time breathing. Now, that it went away but she just waited and waited and it lasted almost in the most of the night and then she could not go to sleep but it was something she had never had before and it was very strange.

She returned to the vaccine clinic around 1415 reporting that she was having trouble breathing. Security called the charge nurses and alerted them that a patient needed assistance. Writer came out to patient who was seated in her car. We assessed patient who was visibly having difficulty breathing and was unable to respond to questions without difficulty breathing. Emergency medication box was opened and epinephrine was prepped. We assessed patients allergies and recent medications taken. Patient denied hx of breathing problems or anxiety. Pt denied chest pain. Per protocol for potential allergic reaction, 0.3ml of epi was given at approximately 1426 via IM injection in the pt&#39;s left arm. ED triage nurse was called and asked to come assist. Two ED technicians with stretcher arrived and with writer  accompanying them transported pt to ED.

                                                48 hours after shot in left arm I started to have a earache on left side, traveled down the left side of face, into jaw area and down left side of my throat like tonsils and into neck area.  Into 72 hours after shot my face, neck and throat area started swelling.  At that time I went to ER for assistance due to the swelling and pain.  The ER after taking  review thought it a infected saliva gland and treated me for that.  As told by ER if no large progress contact my local Dr. and see ENT.  On Tues. (one week from Covid injection) I was in touch with my local  Dr. they had me come to their office for some care and scheduled me with a ENT.  They have been able to get the profuse swelling down out of the left side of my face, neck and throat.  I&#39;m scheduled for a CT scan on March 5, 2021 to see where the original problem started.  I&#39;m contacting  you for two reason&#39;s  1.  I have a March 10th. appointment scheduled I need to cancel and am having issues doing this.  Even in light of all this I want to reschedule for late April for my second shot and am not able to do that as well.   2.  Can you assist with any information if this has happened to other folks and if I should be clear to take my second dose.  This has been quite a nightmare and hard to bring under control.  I believe in the vaccine and this maybe just a quirk in how it happened but any information you can give me would be welcome.  I have looked on the website and it does say that there have been people who have also had symptoms like this from the shots where the side they get the shot on reacts.  Thanking you in advance for your time and assistance.

                                                Within 10 minutes I became nauseous. I left the vaccination center and drove home becoming increasing ill. When I got home I went to bed and slept for two days, nauseous, weak, body aches, a rash under the vaccinated arm and on my back left side,  headaches, fever, sleep interruption, vivid dreams.  The left arm which had been vaccinated was extremely sore and remained so, just recently lessening.  I believe I had Covid 19 in February of 2020 and while I got ill, did not experience the severity of illness that I experienced after vaccination. Now, 17 days later I continue to experience weakness, headaches and recently have had difficulty breathing after exercise. Although the rash has gone away, the left side is still itchy, but less so.     I have discussed this with my Doctor and he informed me that my response to second shot may be stronger, although he did not tell me to avoid the second dose.

When I was drinking the water I was having problems swallowing. Then I started having problems breathing. I then broke down on a rash my skin was so red it looked like I was sun burned. My skin also peeled. Then I was taken into the emergency room by ambulance. They put an IV on me when I got to the hospital. They put a steroid &amp; pepcid famotidine. They told me if I was not better by the next day to go back. My voice also goes occasionally &amp; I still don&#39;t have energy.

                                                Patient is a 71-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity who presents with complaint of acute onset shortness of breath.  She reports she was walking around her house earlier when she suddenly became short of breath.  She denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling but states that shortness of breath persisted.  She denies any tobacco, alcohol or drug use and states she has never had any symptoms similar to this before.  Denies any lung disease or heart disease previously.  She does have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is on metoprolol and rosuvastatin respectively which she reports good compliance.  Denies family history of MI or strokes.  She also denies other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or lower extremity edema.  In the ED vitals were found to be within normal limits.  EKG was obtained showing diffuse T wave inversions, right bundle branch block, no ST changes, no hypertrophy.  Troponin found to be elevated at 0.137, creatinine elevated at 1.3, BUN 26.  Chest x-ray was within normal limits.  Otherwise lab work was unremarkable.  She was given aspirin and Nitropaste Hospital Course:         Patient was admitted to the medical floor and remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay. She actually remained asymptomatic and had no further shortness of breath. She was not hypoxic, at no point required supplemental oxygen. Her troponins however continued to uptrend to 0.389. Cardiology consulted, she was medically optimized with increased statin dose, therapeutic lovenox, and aspirin. Original plan was for cardiac catheterization. However, a d-dimer was ordered which returned elevated to 13.7. CTA was performed which revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with large clot burden and concern for right heart strain. Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV with mild diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation. She was deemed not to be candidate for EKOS. Troponin elevation was felt to be type II NSTEMI 2/2 PE.  PE was classified as unprovoked as she has no definite risk factors for this: no prior DVT/PE, no family history of clotting disorder, no evidence of malignancy (UTD with cancer screenings and visits PCP q6m for health maintenance), no cell line abnormalities, no prolonged immobility or long trips or surgeries, no trauma, no hormone or steroid therapies or even antidepressants. She is obese, and has mild CKD. She tested negative for COVID-19 by antigen testing. The only identifiable change in her health habits recently was receiving the first COVID-vaccine dose on 3/18. We discharged her with Eliquis with instructions to taper from 10BID to 5BID after 7 days. As she will be on anticoagulation, the benefit will likely outweigh the risk of receiving the second COVID dose.  She will follow up with her PCP and hematology/oncology.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from contactable Nurse (the patient). A 71-year-old female received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Feb2021 at 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to Nitrofuradantoin from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included probiotics (PROBIOTICS), ergocalciferol (CALCIFEROL VIT D), ascorbic acid, biotin, calcium, equisetum arvense stem, ferrous fumarate, nicotinamide, panicum miliaceum seed, proteins nos, shark cartilage (VIVISCAL ADVANCED HAIR HEALTH) and colecalciferol, ubidecarenone (COQ10 &#43; D3). The patient reported that, after approximately 10 min after receiving vaccine her lips and tongue became numb. Slight throat constriction and heaviness in chest -15min later. The patient stated that, she got the 1st dose on Saturday, 20Feb2021. While she was there waiting after she got her injection, about 10 minutes, all the sudden her mouth and tongue became numb. So, she called the EMS guy over and asked him if she was having a reaction, he said that it probably was and asked her if she felt like her tongue or throat was swelling. States that she did not feel like they were swelling, but she did feel a little constricted in her throat. Stated that she still has the numbness, though it was a little less in her lips, but now her right cheek was numb on 23Feb2021. The patient experienced right cheek numbness on 23Feb2021, after approximately 10 min after receiving vaccine my lips and tongue became numb on 20Feb2021 16:10 with outcome of not recovered on 20Feb2021 16:10, slight throat constriction and heaviness in chest -15 min later on 20Feb2021 16:25. The event was assessed as medically significant. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of Hypoasthesia,Throat constriction,Chest discomfort.. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.

Upon my evaluation she is stable but begins to cough.  She has moderate posterior pharyngeal irritation as well.  She has been monitored.  Chest x-ray is reassuring.  The present do not think labs are necessary.  She is been advised to monitor her symptoms at home and return for any concerns.  I recommended Benadryl as well as short course of prednisone.  She has received prednisone here and advised her to take prednisone tomorrow and then discuss additional doses with her primary doctor control

                                                I was fine when getting the injection and my ½ hour wait. I was fine during dinner and after dinner and until about 9 hours after the injection when my arm felt exceedingly sore. I had been watching a free Amazon Prime cute movie while knitting a blanket for my grandson. When the movie was over and I was clearing my knitting, I noticed my super sore arm. I got up to check my face in the mirror to be sure that I was not having a reaction. But I did have a reaction with a rash on my chest and face 9 hours after the injection. My arm really hurt for three days but is fine now.  When I saw my red face and chest, I took a Zyrtex D and a Benadryl.  It did not seem to help the redness to go away. When I felt some tightening of my throat and started to feel that I might be starting to lose some clarity of thought, I quickly watched a minute video on how to use my new kind of generic epipen and jabbed myself in the leg and called 911.    I felt much better after the epipen in terms of my thinking and throat.  Basically, the medics that came to the house and said that I had taken what they would give me at the hospital and it was up to me if I wanted to go to the emergency room or not; they would take me but I would need a ride home. With the pandemic and 48 new cases, I decided to stay home and I went to bed; the rash on my face was gone in the morning. The next days I just felt muscle soreness all through my body (day 2) and felt tired (next two days) but had no fever at any time.  I am fine today. I appear to have two very small areas on my chest that probably related to the reaction.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

She initially did well, but after 30-40 minutes the patient came back to the pharmacy complaining of chest pain and felt her throat was tightening up. She felt it was from the vaccine and not from any other reason. I asked her if I could call a paramedic and she declined. I asked about calling a family member/ friend and she also declined. I gave her 5ml of liquid Benadryl and asked her to continue sitting in the pharmacy.  After apx. 10-15 minutes she stated she was starting to feel better. I checked on her every few minutes and kept her in my view the entire time. After apx. 30 more minutes she stated feeling a lot better and wanted to go home. I again offered to call someone or call paramedics and she adamantly refused. I gave her some additional Bendadryl to take home with instructions to take 5 ml every 4 hours for the rest of the day. She left the store. After a apx. 5 minutes a technician went out to see if she had left. She spoke to the patient in her car and patient stated she was fine and heading home. She stated she could drive b/c she only lives a couple minutes from the store.

At 11 pm went to bed with large lump in my throat, felt like I was breathing thru a straw plus whole body freezing from inside out. Could not get warm. Added layers of clothes and blankets and laid like that all nite, no sleep. 7am called nurse, advised to remove some of the layers, drink hot liquids and Tylenol every four hours. By mid afternoon the cold was gone but severe achy bones, even the bottom of my feet hurt. Next day hot and cold and ache. Fourth day dripping sweat all day and flu like symptoms. Took three showers to get sweats down plus the entire time had been taking Tylenol every four hours. Day five just drained, felt like I&#39;d been through the wringer.

                                                became more short of breath; Exacerbation of COPD; This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable Other HCP. A 72-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/Lot EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and Concomitant medication were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient had end stage COPD and noted that she became more short of breath 1-2 days after receiving her 2nd dose on 02Mar2021. It was also reported that provider from the Covid-19 vaccine clinic called patient to follow up on her recent covid-19 vaccine that was done on 01Mar2021. She tried to manage it on her own at home but noted in the couple of weeks that it was not improving. She would be more short of breath with and w/o ambulation. Her husband, (Name), took her to an express care. Today (16Mar2021) whom evaluated her with blood work, chest x-ray and gave her a breathing tx. States she was prescribed abx and prednisone. She does not see much change yet since discharge. On her discharge paperwork, she notes that she was instructed to let covid vaccine clinic and pcp know about her potential reaction vs. Exacerbation of copd. Pt states she is scheduled to see her pcp on Monday, 22Mar2021, along with her pallative care team. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, Short of breath is most likely related to the end stage COPD, which is not related to the suspected drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I remember telling my brother I hurt everywhere below my waist; was just home from work where on my feet unless I sit down to rest. It all culminated with increased breathlessness and went to emergency at hospital at 8:30 pm on April 22, 2021.  Diagnosis was MANY pulmonary embolisms, some large. I have taken week long road trips for the past several years with  hours and hours at the wheel with no problems.   It just seems like a real strange coincidence of the vaccine and subsequent symptoms.

The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: SL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 12Jan2021 at 10:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took varicella zoster vaccine (SHINGLES VACCINE) for immunization and had a little reaction but just the normal things. On Tuesday morning, the patient got the COVID-19 shot and was fine. This morning (15Jan2021), the patient was not feeling great, has a slight headache, her breathing is heavier, and below her breast line is a tightness she can&#39;t really describe. The patient asked if these were a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and wondering if this is normal. As a treatment for the events, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient asked if she can or should get a test, a COVID-19 test. It has been so many days since having the vaccine, 4 days later, she is wondering if she might have COVID-19. The patient isn&#39;t sure and is just asking a question. It is confirmed that she has not had a test or tested positive for COVID-19. The outcome of &#34;Not feeling great&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

                                                Patient reported an anaphylactic reaction  (throat swelling, trouble breathing) to ibuprofen. She also indicated she developed a rash all over her body to a flu vaccine in 1970s, attributed to her egg allergy. Due to her extensive allergies and the fact that she has not gotten a vaccine since 1970s, I would need to monitor her for 30 minutes. (Even though none of her allergies cross react with ingredients in covid Pfizer vaccine. I gave patient vaccine and had her sit in waiting  room to be monitored. After 5 or so minutes I noticed her head down, I asked if she was feeling okay she said yes just very tired. I asked if any trouble breathing she said no but her mouth feels dry. Another five minutes go by and patients head is down again, I again ask if she is okay she says yes just very tired and she wasn&#39;t before vaccine. I ask if any trouble breathing/swallowing, she said it&#39;s a little hard to swallow but she thinks its because her mouth is dry. I get patient a water and ask if she is okay if I give her a Benadryl. She says yes so I give her 50mg Benadryl by mouth. Another 5 minutes go by and again I have to ask patient how she was feeling, she said fine. I ask how her throat is, she says it just feels kind of tight. Due to this progression of allergic reaction (although slow, clearly progressing)  I told patient I will have to call for an ambulance. Paramedics showed up after 5-10 minutes and took care of patient. I relayed all this info to them as well as the dispatcher on the phone. Paramedics took patient to hospital conscious and breathing on her own.

A 73-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose intramuscular on 03Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at nursing home/senior living facility. Medical history included alcohol use, diverticulitis, iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), asthma, hypertension, anxiety, recent C. diff infection, allergies to penicillin. She was not pregnant. The patient had not experienced Covid-19 prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included apixaban (APIXABAN), bioflavonoids nos, calcium ascorbate, hesperidin, rutoside, sodium ascorbate, zinc amino acid chelate (VITAMIN C [BIOFLAVONOIDS NOS;CALCIUM ASCORBATE;HESPERIDIN;RUTOSIDE;SODIUM ASCORBATE;ZINC AMINO ACID CHELATE]), cyanocobalamin (B-12), furosemide (LASIX), simethicone (manufacturer unknown), tramadol (manufacturer unknown), vancomycin (manufacturer unknown) oral, omeprazole (PROTONIX), amlodipine (manufacturer unknown), vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN), thiamine (manufacturer unknown), aripiprazole (ABILIFY), atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR), clonazepam (KLONOPIN), folic acid (manufacturer unknown), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT). The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 10Jan2021, 7 days after getting vaccine, the patient developed shortness of breath and fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, O2 sat 70% on RA, now intubated and in multiorgan failure. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness for immediate risk of death from the event. The patient was hospitalized for the events for 18 days. Patient received treatment with corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals, dialysis, mechanical ventilation, inhaled Epoprostinol. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: unknown in Jan2021. Pre / post vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with unknown result. The with outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal gap between the vaccination and the event onset, the Company considered that there was not a reasonable possibility that the events were related to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. The patient&#39;s advanced age, underlying medical conditions and multiple concomitant medications could be contributory to the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

Patient also reported some throat tightness and nausea. Patient received the first does of the Pfizer COVID vaccine about one hour PTA. Patient began having hypertension noted to be in the 180-215 systolics and patient reports baseline of 120s systolic. Patient was brought directly from the vaccine clinic to the ED. Upon arrival at the ED, patient experienced a syncopal episode and eventually came out of this but was confused. It was reported in the notes that patient was slightly dehydrated which could have contributed to her symptoms. Once the patient recovered from this episode and hypertension was resolved, patient was discharged home to follow up with PCP.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

The hives presented as large welts all very itchy. I applied Calamine lotion and took a Loratadine pill, and the hives and itch subsided dramatically. I also developed flu-like symptoms of malaise and wheezing. At no time did I have a fever nor did my throat swell or close. Saturday, 24 hours after the first Loratadine pill, the hives and swelling reappeared but disappeared within 15 minutes of taking another Loratadine pill. Sunday through today, the swollen knees and wheeze remain but diminished in severity

Patient received her second dose of the covid vaccine on 2/19/21, 3 days prior to presentation. The following day, she started having &#34;breathing issues&#34; so she was given a dose of prednisone. 1 day prior to presentation, her breathing had improved but she was feeling generally sick, so she was given tylenol but not pred. Then, today, day of admission, patient was having bodyaches, weakness, headache, and breathing issues again. She took prednisone this morning, but still had to turn up her O2 because her work of breathing kept fluctuating. Admitted 2/22/21 ? 2/24/21.

I gave her 1 dose of EpiPen at site of injection. She did start feeling a little better. Paramedics came and she was transported to the hospital. I did speak with her later and she was feeling better. She did tell me that they didn&#39;t think it was an anaphylaxis reaction but a reaction to the vaccine

                                                L arm/hand numbness; blood pressure abnormality; chest pain; respiratory distress; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other-HCP. This other HCP reported for a 73-Years-Old (same age at vaccination) female patient that she received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot number EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medication was none. She had not been back to her pcp for &#34;several years&#34;. No known history of HTN. She did have a blood pressure cuff at home. During her 15-minute waiting period after the injection on an unspecified date, the patient began to experience L arm/hand numbness. Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to blood pressure abnormality, chest pain, rapid progression of symptoms and respiratory distress. Treatment included: no therapy. Follow up response was excellent. Patient discharge: stable to go home and follow up with PCP. Outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, and on a close drug-event temporal association,  the Company  assessed there was a reasonable possibility that the reported serious events  were related to the suspect vaccine  BNT162B2.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 EUA Vaccine  Pt received first COVID vaccine 2/25/21. Tested positive for COVID late February. Reported to ED 3/5/21 with near syncope. Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

                                                My mom only had site soreness after her covid vaccine on 1/21 which resolved within a couple days. However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

However, she felt it wasn&#39;t severe enough to contact me as her asthma specialist.  No cough per patient for the week prior to the second dose of PfizerBioNTech. March 10, 2021:  Patient received 2nd dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine at 1:10pm.  Said she had mild chest tightness during the waiting period and used her Ventolin but she attributed it to the characteristics of the waiting room area.  Between 5:00pm and 6:00pm (~4 hours later), she became light-headed, vomited and began to cough frequently.  She contacted her primary care physician who told her to use Mucinex and contact me if needed. March 12, 2021:  Patient contacted my office in the early afternoon.  Unable to stop coughing while on telephone.  Came to office approximately 90 minutes later.  Physical Exam;  Peak Flow 210 (personal best 310-320), oxygen saturation 93-95% (typically 97-98%), temp-98.2 F.  Intractable cough with scattered bilateral expiratory wheezes on auscultation.  Heart rate 132 and regular.  Patient treated with Levalbuterol 1.25 mg nebulization with subsequent modest improvement in frequency of cough, pulse 102, oxygen saturation 96-97%.  She declined going to emergency department of hospital because she did not want to get infected with COVID-19 from a patient in the waiting room.  She declined Prednisone when told that the corticosteroid might reduce the efficacy of the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Placed on Budesonide 1 mg bid and Levalbuterol 1.25 mg q4-6h prn.

A 75-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021 04:00, she went to bed at night and woke up at 4 AM with a severe headache. She took Aleve and went back to bed. When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart.

Outside the room patient was not able to get a breath, her escort kept her upright and called for help.  Patient was moved into a wheelchair.  I was called to assist.  The patient had provided an epipen and felt her throat was closing.  At this time, approximately 1350 I administered the Epipen.  Shortly thereafter the patient was able to get air again.  Her vitals were monitored for the next ~45 minutes and she progressively felt better. At this time the patient was offered and ER evaluation, but felt she was well enough to go home.  She was transported by her husband and instructed to follow up with her PCP regarding the 2nd dose.  I provided her with an epipen from our Emergency kit, as she did not have another one with her or at home.

The adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no investigation assessment. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included that the patient was given a shot of 125 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), but another report said they gave her prednisone so they were kind of conflicting in the report, but it was a shot, and also cetirizine (ZYRTEC) and famotidine (PEPCID), and her inhaler for wheezing. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.

Later I had mild ringing in my ears. i had intense anxiety from the time my heart started pounding. ALL of these symptoms lasted for 3 days and It only happened when I ate food. I tossed and turned all night and my body was very uncomfortable and I was still extremely anxious. I started getting better after 3 days and took about 9 days to finally start feeling right. Doctor gave me an EKG and said it was fine but sent me to a cardiologist. I had another EKG, ECHO,  24 hour Monitor with a Holter, and a stress test. results pending.

I took a rescue inhaler to see if it would help. I stayed in bed all day wednesday. I coughed all night, I am on O2 all night. I seem to be parched, mouth is dry, drinking a lot of water. Thursday was just as bad, I wasnt feeling well. the breathing gets better a little every day but I am coughing up green mucus so I called my pulmonologist and he called in an antibiotic.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot number: EN6198, expiration date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. There were no problems, no symptoms, no pain or nothing on the day of vaccination. On 13Mar2021, the patient started experiencing swelling of the lip at around 08:30 or 09:00 and itching and swelling on the throat. She didn&#39;t wake up then, she went to sleep and she slept until about 05:45 and she thought it would just go away but there was much more swelling. She took Benadryl but she is concerned about the swelling, it was still there. She took another Benadryl at 04:00 on Sunday and she took one the previous night at 12 o&#39;clock and the swelling has diminished a lot but it was not gone away all together. She was concerned because of 2 reasons, one she was due for another shot in a couple weeks and another reason was she wanted to know if it came from the vaccine. She clarified that the swelling was on her lips, mainly the left side pretty much of her lips. It started with the bottom lip and it was kind of so now that it was the top and bottom, it was both lips on the left side. She gave a lot of thought to this and that night she did have some frozen blueberries and bananas. She never ate blueberries on their own she usually puts them in oatmeal or something like that, so she thought maybe it could be the results of the blueberries since she has never had that. The patient asked whether lip swelling was an expected side effect and whether there was any issue with receiving one dose instead of the two doses.  Limited information was available over the call.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper forearm on 01Mar2021 at the age of 75-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a pharmacy (in a grocery store). The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient&#39;s medical history included retired (retired registered nurse), ongoing depression (has had this condition for probably 20 years), ongoing lung cancer (has had this condition for probably 3 years), ongoing bipolar (has had this condition for about 4 years), ongoing emphysema (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years), and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years). Concomitant medications included duloxetine taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking this probably for 15 years); and arformoterol tartrate (BROVANA) (started taking this probably 5 years ago), budesonide (started taking this probably 5 years ago), tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) (has been taking this for probably about 4-5 years), oxygen (has been using this full time for 3 years), and Trilogy machine (she sleeps with this, it is an invasive intubation. She puts a big mask on and it pumps air in, pulls air out, letting her lungs rest. Her oxygen hooks up to it), all taken for emphysema and COPD from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported that she received the vaccine on 01Mar2021 and sometime in Apr2021 around Easter, she went to the hospital for COPD exacerbation, tiredness and weakness. The patient required a visit to the emergency room due to the events and reported that she went by ambulance to the hospital. The patient stated that she has these events often and it has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine. She went to the hospital with exacerbation of COPD and missed her date to get her last shot. She wanted to know whether she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine with her experience after the 1st dose. The patient reported that she now weighs 177 after she has been pumped full of cortisone. The patient reported that her lung doctor was really the one that manages her medical. The patient reported that she thinks she came home from the hospital the day before Easter and she was in the hospital for 5 days (in Apr2021). She was sick before that, at home, and she finally had to call # to come and get her. She believes she had to call # the 5th day before Easter, but she was not positive. When asked to clarify what she meant by sick, the patient explained she was extremely tired, she couldn&#39;t get out of bed and couldn&#39;t move. She was having trouble breathing. She was on oxygen 24/7 and sleeps with a trilogy machine so she was having a lot of trouble, it was awful. She said she then found out at the hospital her red blood cell was below 5 and her iron was critically low. They had to give her 2 units of blood and an infusion. Then she went back yesterday and got another infusion and she has to go back next week for another infusion. The patient confirmed that she was hospitalized for COPD. She then stated she didn&#39;t know the exact date of when she was discharged from the hospital, but she was thinking it was the day she was scheduled for her second shot. She then clarified she came home Easter. The patient reported that she can&#39;t do much without having to sit down, catch her breath, and rest a little bit. She was improving but not as fast as she&#39;d like to. While reading the vaccine record card, the patient stated &#34;my eyes aren&#39;t as good as they used to be&#34;. Her pulmonologist stated she was going to die if she doesn&#39;t take the vaccine. If she catches COVID she was not going to make it, so her pulmonologist thinks her chances are better with the vaccine than without it. The patient said she goes all the time to the hospital; therefore, she doesn&#39;t think the events were related to the vaccine. She had been sick several times. They can&#39;t do anything about the bleeding, they can&#39;t go in to do anything because of her lungs, her lungs were so bad. No further details were provided regarding the bleeding she was speaking of. The patient reported that duloxetine doesn&#39;t come as 90 mg so she takes a 30 mg and 60 mg tablet; she mixes the Brovana and Budesoind and takes them at the same time, twice a day. She was given an albuterol solution, 0.5mg PRN (as needed), for her emphysema/COPD. She says she just started taking this from her last hospital stay. The patient reported that she did not remember her iron count, just that it was critically low. She did remember asking the nurse what could happen, and the nurse said a lot of things such as infection. She confirmed tests were done in regards to the lung cancer. Her lungs were too critical for any kind of invasive tests. It was reported that the events Exacerbation of COPD and &#34;extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move&#34; were assessed by the patient as unrelated to BNT162B2. The outcome of the events &#34;Exacerbation of COPD/having trouble breathing&#34; and &#34; extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move/tiredness&#34; was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the narrative information provided, the reported events Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Fatigue, Asthenia, Blood iron decreased, Red blood cell count decreased and Asthenia are assessed as intercurrent medical conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.
