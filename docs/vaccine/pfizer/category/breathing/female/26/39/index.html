                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

                                                Within five minutes I felt very faint and dizzy along with nausea. Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

Patient denied sudden warm feeling, hives, itching, swollen lips/tongue, dyspnea, wheezing, dizziness, tachycardia, crampy, abdominal pain and vomiting.   I have observed only what was reported by the patient.   Treatment/intervention: patient was given water and a hard candy to suck on. After sucking on the hard candy she stated that helped with her symptoms.  Pt was monitored for 30 minutes and stated she felt better with no symptoms before leaving.  Informed what to do in case of a severe allergic reaction.   Pt was asked if she would like to go to the ED and pt denied.

Waited with patient until 4:50, able to stand on own, not dizzy anymore, felt okay to leave.

                                                After receiving the second dose of the covid 19 vaccine, as I was walking to the elevator, my vision started to become blurred and I began to see stars. I walked over to a nearby chair and as I sat down it felt as if my throat was closing. I began sweating profusely and my whole body was flushed. My heart rate was tachycardic and my blood pressure was hypertensive when checked in the ED. When I got to the ED, my vitals were obtained like I described but my heart rate had slowed down by time I got there. A nurse passing by explained that my heart was tachycardia when he assessed me in the chair. The ED did an EKG of my heart that determined my heart rate was normal sinus rhythm in the 70s. They observed me for roughly an hour and let me go home. My discharge papers explain I had a vagal response.

As far as what happened, I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Jan. 13th @ 05:15 at hospital and started feeling symptoms roughly six hours later, symptoms being nausea, chills, splitting headaches, muscle fatigue, feeling tired and joint pain. I had understood that these side effects were common and not to worry, however, the next day on Jan. 14th around 11:00am, I blacked out at home. Luckily, my partner had caught me before I feel to the ground, but he stated that my eyes had glazed over, my breathing was shallow, and I hardly had a pulse. He was getting ready to do chest compressions, but I had come out of whatever fog that had knocked me down and became responsive. Around 12:00 pm I had arrived at the ED where they had given me a bag on NS, Zofran for the nausea and Toradol for some inflammation management. I believe I discharged from the ED around 15:20.

She still has a lump at the injection side which has gotten smaller in size but still hurts to touch. Left arm has a knot in it from injection site; does not reuired ER or visit to physician&#39;s office. It feels like a bump with something in her arm. She doubts that is the case. She wanted to see if that was normal and when it might go away, especially since she should be getting second dose on 26Jan2021. She is a speech therapist. There is no prescriber. They came and gave to everyone all at once. It was really big at first. It felt like someone punched her. It was a big giant lump, but it is getting better. The injection was given in the upper left arm and it felt like it went into the muscle. The outcome of the event vaccination site mass was recovering, and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

The staff gave me an injection of Benadryl into my right arm. The spot reduced in size over the duration of an hour and I was sent home with instructions to take OTC Benadryl until the swelling disappeared completely later that evening.  Event #2: Shortness of breath and chest tightness beginning exactly 74hrs after the vaccination (Sunday, 01/31/2021 at 2:15pm). This side-effect continues to persist and is  not due to a true Covid-19 infection.

A 26-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Other medical history and known allergies were reported as none. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the report and vaccination. Concomitant medications included zinc, ascorbic acid (VIT C), ergocalciferol (VIT D) and an unspecified birth control medication. The first dose of BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer as reported) was received on 06Jan2021 12:00 PM in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no other vaccine in the four weeks prior to second dose vaccination. On 27Jan2021 23:00, the patient experienced nose bleed, fever of 102, severe injection site swelling (grapefruit size), lethargy, tachycardia, shortness of breath, severe joint pain, migraine and muscle pain. The patient did not receive treatments for the reported adverse events. Patient had COVID test post vaccination specified as nasal swab on 27Jan2021 with test result as negative. The events were reported as recovered with lasting effects.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the close drug-event temporal association and the location,  the reasonable possibility that the reported severe injection site swelling is related to BNT162B2 seems likely.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 28Jan2021 at 16:55 (reported as 4:55 PM) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was given at a vaccination clinic. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks and had no adverse events following prior vaccinations and that was why she thought she would be fine. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included anxiety, peanut allergy, tree nut allergy, and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

About 5 minutes after leaving 11:30 I could taste the vaccine in my mouth. I immediately felt intense sharp tingling in my lower lip, it felt hot and swollen (upper lip never had a reaction). I instantly felt a lump in my throat and had a hard time swallowing. I started with chest pain that resolved itself in a minute or two. A few minutes later a family member noticed my face was red and flushed and said I looked like I had a sun burn. Swelling in throat resolved within an hour. Lip never visually looked swollen but I could feel the tightness, burning and tingling that resolved within the hour. Redness on face resolved within a couple hours. Had tiny blisters about 3 show up above upper lip I still have them the next day with a couple more but they aren&#39;t causing problems. My airway was never blocked I never had a hard time breathing. I did have a sore throat this morning March 25 day after vaccine. All other symptoms seem normal.

I sat for 20 minutes and took a Tylenol. I left the site and about 30 minutes later I was feeling extremely tired, and out of breath. Talking was difficult and taking too much energy, my shortness of breath was alarming. It went away within 4 hours.  2 days later I was feeling fine, and was sitting having a coffee. Out of nowhere I had a rapid heartbeat and started feeling woozy and light headed again. I didn&#39;t have as much shortness of breath but it felt like if I were to try and do anything it would exhaust me. I took Tylenol again and things calmed down in about 2-3 hours.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction. I have an exercise bike at home, and tried to work out but had to stop after only half an hour of very low effort biking because I couldn&#39;t get a deep breathe. usually I can bike for an hour at high intensity no problem and have never had to stop because I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

                                                When I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID shot I had no issues. When I received the second dose I had the vaccine injected and then I got up and walked to the monitoring room where we sit for 15 minutes. Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

Symptoms were managed with over the counter antihistamines until 1/11 when the antihistamines were not working and my throat was swollen and tight, my chest was tight and my voice was horse. I got prescribed prednisone on 1/11 and have been on a long taper of that, with scheduled benadryl, pepcid and zyrtec.

                                                within minutes after my shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. i was monitored for 30 minutes at the vaccine site before being escorted to the medical observation area. While in the medical observation area I tried to take a sip of water but could not swallow it. At that moment I began having a tight feeling in my chest. I began to hyperventilate followed by difficulty breathing or talking. This was accompanied by feelings of impending doom, and uncontrollable trembling and inability to concentrate on what the medical observation area Doctor was saying. The time from the drink of water until I was able to breathe, speak, and concentrate normally was about 20 minutes. Tightness in my chest has improved but not fully recovered. General malaise and headache have developed.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 9:15 am on 2/23/21. Initially, my only symptoms were injection site soreness and minor swelling. Gradually throughout the day, my entire left arm become more and more sore. By 5:00pm, I felt exhausted and dizzy and was having chills. My temperature was 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I took a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, but felt no change. My joints and muscles began to ache around 6:00pm on 2/23/21 and did not stop aching until around 9:00pm on 2/24/21. During the evening of 2/23/21, my dizziness increased and I felt as if I would pass out any time I sat up or stood. My temperature had returned to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit by 10:00pm on 2/23/21. I then took a dose of Motrin to help with my soreness. On 2/24/21 from morning until 8:30pm, I had no fever or chills, but still felt exhausted and had minor muscle/joint achiness. I took 3 doses of Motrin on 2/24/21 to help with the soreness. Throughout the day, I had some difficulty breathing (felt like a mild asthma attack) and used my emergency inhaler once. At 8:30pm on 2/24/21, my temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. I took another dose of Motrin and went to sleep. Around 3:00am on 2/25/21, I woke up drenched in sweat, but feeling better. My temperature was normal then. When I woke up at 7:00am on 2/25/21, I no longer felt achy, dizzy, or tired. I still feel (now at 1:30pm on 2/25/21)as though my asthma is aggravated, but am not having difficulty breathing.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

Took Benadryl 50mg before bedtime.  2 days after vaccine: woke up with voice changes, coughing/choking with speaking. Used epipen once, felt full relief for about 1-2 hours. Trouble speaking again. Then went to ER, had epipen again twice, over two hours, Benadryl 50IV and Pepcid and steroids. Sitting in the ER now debating admission. Likely being admitted., home epipen are too expensive to treat q2h by myself.

                                                Reporter received the first COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 and waited the recommended 15 minutes for observation. After the observation period, she left the facility and started to notice tightness and what she describes as a &#34;bubble&#34; at the top of her throat. She also noticed a tingling sensation in the top of her lip, but did not notice any swelling. Reporter took 25 mg of liquid Benadryl and within an hour the sensation in her throat began to go away. Reporter received the second COVID-19 vaccine on 1/20/2021 at 08:25 AM. She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose. Around 08:40 AM, she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat). Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable. She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination. This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

Silicone in breast implant spread into her neck where patient was having difficulty breathing; Right breast implant exploded and spread to her neck where she was having difficulty breathing/Right breast implant erupted. Silicone in breast implant spread into her neck where patient was having difficulty breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician.  A 28-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# unknown), intramuscular on 13Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccine location was right arm. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient called stating she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She was in the resident lounge and all of a sudden, the right breast implant just popped. Silicone in her breast implant spread into her neck where patient was having difficulty breathing on 14Jan2021. The patient was hospitalized on 14Jan2021, with pain medication and will have to have the implants removed. They think it is vaccine related. Patient was waiting for general surgery. The outcome of right breast implant exploded was unknown. The outcome of difficulty breathing was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported breast implant rupture and associated difficulty breathing were more likely due to breast implant surgery and the quality of implant, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had a fever, chills, headache, and fatigue. A week later, I&#39;m still not feeling 100%. The scariest reaction was a rash that broke out all over my chest. I also had one on my forehead. It looked like lacerations and I still have marks left behind. The rash on my chest was very hot and I had trouble breathing at night. I took pictures.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea and decreased appetite. This persisted throughout the entire next day following vaccination. The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

But at night I started wheezing, had sweats and chills, did not check my temperature but I had pretty severe chills that night. In the morning I checked no fever, but still chills, severe cough and sore throat.. Headache and fatigue.  All got worse more severe on Saturday and then I decided to go get tested for Covid on the Care Clinic. I had a known exposure to COVID before I got the vaccine around  01/04/21 - my husband who tested positive on the 6th) I tested positive. All symptoms continued (except the tingling on the mouth it stopped on the 8th) and I saw my OB-GYN on the 11th due to a low amniotic fluid - I had an ultrasound at the facility and was referred to MD and saw him on the 11th as well.  Now I lost my sense of taste and smell. The chills have subsided a little bit and so the headache, but fatigue, congestion and cough are still there. I had increased intermittent shortness of breathe but could be the baby&#39;s position.

A 29-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 05Jan2021 at single dose to get vaccinated to prevent COVID. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS) and hadn&#39;t taken Vitamins yesterday or day before. The patient got yesterday on 05Jan2021 the vaccine and thought that it was a side effect which she didn&#39;t have with the first vaccine. She had been having chills since last night 05Jan2021 and little bit of fever in Jan2021. She didn&#39;t have too much pain in her left arm right where she got the vaccine but her left clavicle that was swollen and painful to touch in Jan2021. The patient felt like she had a little bit of shortness and breathlessness last night 05Jan2021 but she was fine, her throat was super dry in Jan2021. For lot number, she stated &#34;It is E. I am not sure what the next one is. It might be like a 21284.&#34; The patient had taken only pain killers she took two pain killers before she went to bed she took two pain killers when she woke in the middle of night and in morning. For Lab work, she just started feeling like between 12. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had a fever and chills at night and also a headache, I felt nauseous, vomiting and difficulty breathing. I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.  I then started working part-time for some weeks and am being introduced again now to my regular scheduled.

Rash developed all over body that is similar to the rash Kawasaki syndrome kids get.

I have never had any trouble breathing or any allergic reactions to anything in the past.

                                                Second dose of COVID vaccine (Pfzier/BioNTech) received Friday morning around 8:00, I left work about an hour early that day due to rising nausea, migraine and fatigue. By the time I got to my car in the parking garage I had thrown up and was so dizzy that I called my boyfriend to come pick me up. When I got home I immediately laid down to take a nap. 3 hours later I woke up very sore and achy and still had a migraine. I remained in bed and later that night I spiked a fever as high as 101.8 fahrenheit. I had severe chills and the aches were so bad that my bones hurt all over and it felt like someone was stabbing me with a metal broom handle. Pain spiked to 8 on the pain scale and with the length of time I had this pain, it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The dizziness and fatigue caused me to need help to get out of bed to use the restroom. I took ibuprofen frequently and Nyquil at night to help relieve the effects without it doing little more than taking the edge off. Saturday night was the same as Friday night with no relief of symptoms. Fever remained around 100.9. Sunday night it dropped to 99.8 with chills, dizziness and fatigue still remaining but aches slightly lessening. Monday night I was still dizzy and weak but not nearly as in much pain and fever had subsided. Tuesday I started to feel more normal by the end of the night, just easily out of breath and off and on again headache.

Two separate instances of this pain, one on 1/18/21 at 1600-1730, and one on 1/18/21 2230-0000.  The second instance the pain was so severe, lead to nausea and one episode of emesis. Initially trialed treatment with antacids but that did nothing to improve the pain. Evaluation by MD on 1/19 at 1300 diagnosed with pleuritic pain secondary to inflammation. No prior history of this, no cardiac history, and no history of GERD.  Other post vaccination symptoms included fever approx 10 hours following the vaccine, nausea, one episode of diarrhea, fatigue, body achs, dizziness, and chills, all of which resolved by 1/18 at 1100am.

I then was speaking with management and felt faint and short of breath, continued to be tingly.

This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after receiving my vaccine I felt warmth down injected arm. Approximately 20 minutes post injection, I experienced a drop in my blood pressure, heaviness in my legs (like walking through cement), and ringing in my ears. At approximately 12:30-12:45pm I experienced mental fog (I couldn&#39;t remember how to turn off my windshield wipers), increased heart rate, rapid onset of feelings of panic, minor shortness of breath, neck/clavicle tightness on side of injection, and sweating. Between approximately 1:30pm and 2:30pm I continued to have extreme sweating, as well as: increased pulse, fatigue, dry throat, muscle weakness/shakiness, brain fog, and headache. At approximately 3:30 I hit my knee on the bed frame and felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and immediately had a severe drop in blood pressure that felt similar to a vasovagal event. I called the vaccine clinic and my symptoms were noted and I was told to seek help if my symptoms worsened or I felt like I was going to pass out. My symptoms have not worsened but I am still experiencing extreme sweating along with shivering, shakiness, blood pressure changes with movement (orthostatic hypotension), and fatigue - time is currently 5:50pm

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication.

Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

She reported prior to receiving her flu immunization she would take 50mg diphenhydramine. We had her take 50mg diphenhydramine &amp; then wait 30 minutes prior to receiving the first COVID-19 dose. After receiving the vaccine we had her stay in the room directly in front of us for 30 minutes so we could monitor her. It was noted she seemed to be having difficulty breathing &amp; at that point we administered the first epinephrine 0.3mg dose. She reported feeling better &amp; her color got better. We continued to closely monitor her &amp; in approximately 7 to 8 minutes her breathing became labored again. A second epinephrine 0.3mg dose was administered &amp; we called to have her transported to the hospital.

I felt itchy all over.  When I stood up, I felt palpitations and started to feel as if I was going to pass out.  I sat down and I started to tremor and felt like it was hard to catch my breath.  I took an antihistamine and took a puff of albuterol.  I felt a lot better. At 10 AM in the morning, the hives have improved but i still feel some pruritus.

                                                not feeling good (felt like crap); dizziness (really dizzy); weakness; shortness of breath (short of breath); arm feeling weak (arm felt weak); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL0140, expiration date 31Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at a single dose in the left arm as Covid-19 vaccine due to being a front line worker. Medical history included ongoing pre-diabetic from 2015. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine today on 08Jan2021.  Within 15 minutes (also reported as 15 minutes after the vaccine), she experienced not feeling good (felt like crap), dizziness (really dizzy), weakness, shortness of breath (short of breath), and arm feeling weak (arm felt weak) on the side where the injection was received. It&#39;s the weirdest thing, she never had issues with vaccines before. She was asking if this was normal. The outcome of the events was unknown. The nurse reported that the events were related to the suspect product.

                                                I was totally fine for 4 hours. After 4 hours I started to get injection site pain, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, feeling unwell, and swollen lymph nodes. All of this lasted for 2 days. At the end of the 24 hour mark I started having a heartbeat 15-20 bpm higher than my normal, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. I&#39;m now 3.5 days post vaccine dose 1 and still having all of the symptoms in my last sentence plus extreme exhaustion, muscle pain, and fever.

The male nurse came over and started seeing signs of profuse sweating as water began dripping from all over my body. 5 minutes after that I started heaving and gasping for air unaroused next to the nurse as he took my blood pressure.

                                                Mild anaphylaxis about 20 minutes after dose. Abrupt painful tightening of the throat, no real difficulty breathing. My face felt &#34;buzzy&#34; but didn&#39;t swell and I did not have significant itching. I have had similar reactions in the past to cleaning products and pesticides and usually take a benadryl, though I do carry an epipen and had one with me at the time. Instead of going back in the convention center for medical attention I took a benadryl and waited in the parking garage for about an hour and felt the throat restriction ease a bit. About 10 hours later around 8pm the tightness came back suddenly over about 10 minutes and I took another benadryl. The next morning around 7am I had one more round of tightening and took one more benadryl, and it stopped after that. I told my doctor about it a few days later.

In 2019 i began using lamictal and had zero problems with the anti -seizure medication. One week after my second dose of vaccine i developed a significant rash and experienced extreme difficulty breathing. After seeing a dermatologist and getting a biopsy i was told that i had DRESS syndrome which is very uncommon given i had already been on lamictal for such a long period of time. I have been prescribed a topical steroid as well as 40mg prednisone and am titrating off the lamictal to the keppra (1500mg).

Pt also stated she had an anaphylactic history to PCN, Amoxicillin, and Sulfa.  Therefore she was instructed to stay for 30 minutes observation.  Approximately 10 minutes post vaccine, pt stated she was &#34;really hot and tired, like she couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open.&#34;  She was given an ice pack and water.  She denied any difficulty breathing, throat irritation, dizziness, or vision changes.  She initially stated she did not think she could drive home and requested a work note so she did not have to return back to work.  Requested pt have someone pick her up and she refused and stated &#34;she was fine to drive.&#34;  Of note, pt carried on an entire conversation for the one hour she was observed in the lobby here Hospital, laughing and acting appropriately.  She denied the need to be seen at Urgent Care by a Provider for her c/o tiredness.   Upon re-evaluation prior to d/c patient, she was asked by this RN, &#34;do you feel you are able to drive home safely?&#34;  She responded with &#34;I don&#39;t know, I still feel very tired and having trouble keeping my eyes open and I have not walked around.&#34;  Explained to pt that if she was not able to drive home safely she needed to go to Urgent Care here for further monitoring and pt was lead to registration.

                                                I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. After 10-15 minutes from receiving the vaccine, my face got itchy but it was mild so I left after 25 minutes of waiting. Over the next hour the itching got more noticeable (no rash) and my throat felt slightly swollen, although I had no difficulty breathing or talking. I called a pharmacy that advised I take Benadryl, which helped. The next morning my face was still itching and it felt like there was a lump in my throat. I went to urgent care and received a steroid shot and prescription for Atarax, although the pharmacy was closed, so I just ended up taking more Benadryl. Today, 2 days after the vaccine, my face no longer itches and my throat feels normal. Just feel moderately fatigued, although I think that is a normal side effect.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This is the second of two reports of the same patient receiving the second dose of BNT162B2.  A 30-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 17Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose (at the age of 30) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing asthma (diagnosed about 10 years ago), Basedow&#39;s disease from 01Mar2021 and ongoing, hypersensitivity, hyperthyroidism, anxiety. First dose of BNT162B2 was given on 22Feb2021 and she felt sick to her stomach, nausea, had no energy, 160 heart rate atrial fibrillation, hand tremors, shortness of breath, she felt exhausted, low grade fever, thyroid storm, felt tired, shaking, flu symptoms.  Concomitant medications included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken for allergy from 2020 to 24Feb2021, guaifenesin (MUCINEX) taken for hypersensitivity from Dec2020 to 20Feb2021.  When she got the second vaccine, her heart rate was high again. She did have a thyroid storm the day after the second dose (18Mar2021) and she was in the emergency room again since her heart rate was so high. It was reported that the vaccine did cause her thyroid storm. She knows vaccinations have to do with the immune systems, and if she has an autoimmune disease, she is thinking it may have come from it. States two doctors are certain that it triggered an immune response and wanted her to report this. She could barely stand up or talk, she was so short of breath and is guessing that was from her heart. She had normal flu like symptoms from the vaccine but does not think it was related to her thyroid. She has always had little cold symptoms after getting a vaccination. First night she felt very exhausted, tired. She had a low grade fever that Tylenol took care of and it went away within a day. She felt run down and it was vaccination related. The second day (19Mar2021) she had really bad hand tremors that moved into her body. She thought the shaking was from the vaccination and she took a video of it. She did not really have any other symptoms yet, then started to get really fatigued. She went to ER and her heart was really elevated. Each time she went to the doctor or the ER, her heart rate would be 20 beats faster then 20 beats faster again.  The outcome of her heart rate was high again / heart elevated/her heart rate would be 20 beats faster then 20 beats faster again, short of breath was recovering. The outcome of guessing that was from her heart, exhausted/tired/ felt run down/ really fatigued was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

This other HCP (patient) reported for herself that a 30-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8727) at the age of 30-years, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Mar2021 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization, in hospital. Medical history included PTSD, anorexia, chronic migraines, bradycardia. Patient was not pregnancy at time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included propranolol, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), prazosin, alprazolam (XANAX). On 19Mar2021 13:15, the patient experienced allergic reaction-characterized by hives and flushing and anaphylactic reaction (throat and mouth swelling). After medical treatment, hives continued for 3-4 days. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received high dose diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and epinephrine (EPIPEN). Outcome of the events was recovered in 2021. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of Allergic reaction, Anaphylactic reaction. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.

                                                hard to hear at times; horrible pain from head to toe; couldn&#39;t see anything; couldn&#39;t breathe at all; face turned green; fever; aching in her legs; extreme exhaustion; blacking out; diarrhea; sweating; unable to talk; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Apr2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0150) as 1st dose, single, at the age of 30-years-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical/family history and concomitant medications. The patient went to go get her second shot of Pfizer covid vaccine but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her based on her reactions to the first dose. They said there was a chance of anaphylaxis reaction to the second shot. The patient reported blacking out, diarrhea, sweating and unable to talk. She consulted with her healthcare professional regarding whether to get the second shot and they didn&#39;t know. She asked if her reactions were normal. She doesn&#39;t know what to do whether to get a second shot given her reaction. It was mentioned that the patient was hard to hear at times. She got the vaccine on 06Apr2021 around noon and she was fine until around 3:30 am. She woke up in horrible pain from head to toe, she thought maybe she just needed to pee, she didn&#39;t know what was going on. She stood up and she blacked out like she was about to faint. She couldn&#39;t see anything, like it was completely black. She got to bathroom and she couldn&#39;t breathe at all, she couldn&#39;t talk. She thought she needs to go to the hospital, but she couldn&#39;t talk. Her face turned green, she had diarrhea, she was like dripping wet. At this point, she could sort of breathe. She felt like she was being held under water, still dripping sweat. She has recovered completely from these symptoms. The severity of symptoms was so severe she doesn&#39;t know if she had a fever at the same time, it was hard to tell. With the breathing part, she was so freaked out by that, so it&#39;s hard to know for sure, maybe yes. She may have had a low fever. She had a fever that night to the point where she was dripping on the floor. She has aching in her legs. She went to the doctor thinking she had Lyme disease, which she doesn&#39;t. Since that vaccine, she&#39;s had very, somewhat severe leg aches and extreme exhaustion like all the time. she can hardly go to work sometimes. Everybody has days they are tired, but this was different. She had to come home at 2pm and lay down for like five hours. She stated it was persisting. She had a blood test recently and everything came back perfect on 26Apr2021. She thought she had Lyme disease because of all the symptoms she was having, and it all came back negative. She didn&#39;t exactly get turned away. They said they didn&#39;t feel comfortable giving her the second dose of vaccine. The patient stated if a nurse tells her they don&#39;t feel comfortable, she wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable until she speaks to Pfizer. The nurse told her she had to go to an allergist and rheumatologist. The nurse said the same thing, the nurse told her that she should have gone to the hospital, but she wasn&#39;t thinking at that moment. She was just at a loss of what to do. That day at the hospital, they were scared with the second vaccine that she could go into anaphylaxis and she&#39;s not sure what to do. The patient had no other vaccines administered on the same date of Pfizer suspect and no other vaccinations within 4 weeks. The event hard to hear at times started on an unknown date while other events started on 07Apr2021 and ended the same day. The outcome of the events aching in her legs and exhaustion was not recovered, hard to hear at times was unknown while for other events was recovered. The events &#34;she blacked out, like she was about to faint&#34; was assessed as serious medically significant.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

                                                Developed a &#34;scratchy throat approximately 20 minutes post vaccination. Symptoms worsened and she developed shortness of breath. Required evaluation and treatment in the Emergency Department. Received Benadryl, dexamethaxone, famotidine and solumedrol. Second COVID vaccine, no reaction with the first vaccine. ED provider notes below: This patient presented due to concern for allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine and was seen by myself immediately upon arrival.  When in triage the triage nurse noted her oxygen saturation was 81% so she was placed on 2 L nasal cannula and brought directly back to her room.  When placed in the room she was hooked up to the monitor and her oxygen saturation was 100% and I took her off of the nasal cannula and her oxygen saturation remained in the upper 90s.  She had no stridor and respirations were nonlabored.  She was speaking without difficulty and had no vocal changes.  She did not appear to be in any acute distress.  Her posterior oropharynx was widely patent and she had no uvula or tongue swelling or lip swelling.  She did have some blotchiness to the upper chest area but no hives.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Pulse was regular.  Blood pressure was stable.  She was nontoxic in appearance.  An IV was established and the patient was given Decadron and Benadryl for initial treatment.

She did not notify anyone, and after her 15 minute wait, she went home.  Her respiratory symptoms worsened despite taking a dose of diphenhydramine.  At the urging of her family, she went to the ER four hours later, where she was evaluated.  No treatment was done, and she was told that she was having a mild reaction.  Her symptoms resolved after several hours.

I also started to have some swelling in my throat by 4 days after the second dose and ended up going to immediate care for a steroid injection which began to provide relief by the next morning.

Pt complained of a numb throat, and said, &#34;I cant seem to swallow my saliva well.&#34;   This writer did an immediate assessment of patient&#39;s throat with  flashlight, and no swelling, abnormal discharge, or discoloration noted.   Pulse-ox that was available on hand was used on pt, and sats were 96% and HR 78.    MA on site was asked to grab a complete VS machine for somewhere stat, for there was none on site.   This writer reassured pt was going to be okay and to breathe normally, for assessed pt was breathing fast.    This writer called every doctor listed on the &#34;Contact List for COVID Vaccine Clinic,&#34; but there was no response.   This writer then called Urgent Care and Minor Injury Clinic, but the doctors were busy with patients. Asked MAs from those areas to have a doctor call immediately for a patient here was symptomatic.   Once VS got here, VS were taken, and pt was assessed again.    Pt said there was no more numbness in her throat, but tongue was feeling itchy, and her body temp went from hot to cold.    Intitial VS: Temp: 98.3 BP: 122/80 HR: 77 O2: 99% RR: 18   Dr from Urgent Care finally called. Background story given, and she ordered Diphenhydramine Cap 25mg (Benadryl) which this writer had on hand in the emergency kit.   Order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Benadryl given at 1025.   Dr also suggested that ID doctor be called.    At 1030, I got a hold of Dr., gave her a background story, and she advised that the pt stay for another 30 mins to be observed and she would come see the pt.    Dr. arrived at 1100, assessed the patient, and ordered Cetrizine Tab 10mg (Zyrtec) to give to pt, which Dr. had to get from another department. There was no Zyrtec available in emergency kit.   Again, order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Zyrtec given at 1128. An additional Zrytec Tab 10mg was given at same time at 1128 &#34;for home use&#34; per Dr and per her order.    VS set #2 taken at 1133 Temp: 98.1 BP: 133/94 HR: 63 O2: 100% RR: 16   Dr suggested that she schedule an appt to see an allergist and to get an allergy test done prior to the next dose of the COVID vaccine.    Patient was feeling a lot better and more at ease.   Pt left comfortably with no symptoms at 1200.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes post-injection I started to feel lightheaded, dizzy, shaky and increased heart rate. This was swiftly followed by a feeling of tightness in my throat, shortness of breath, and coughing. In addition I had a moderate to severe headache. The hospitals rapid response team was called and I was brought to the emergency department on-site. I was given a racemic epinephrine and albuterol neb treatment which resolved upper airway stridor and cough. I received PO Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone. A EKG was completed. I was observed in the emergency department for about 2 hours until discharge. I was discharged with prescriptions for an Epi-Pen, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The diagnosis on my after visit summary was: Allergic Reaction. I was unable to finish my scheduled shift as an RN.

I gave her oral  benadryl 50 mg and 40 mg of famotidine oral. The difficulty in breathing did not lessen. She began to use her accessory muscles. Her O2 sats were 99%  via finger pulse oximeter. Breathing became increasingly labored. An Epi pen 0.3 mg was administered. An ambulance was called. Her breathing became less labored, she was transported to the hospital  via ambulance to be checked out.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

At 20 mins my throat felt tighter and it was making me cough trying to get air so they gave me 50 ml of benedryl into my right arm. I started to pass out and my breathing was labored so I was given my epipen and taken to the ER. While I was there I was monitored for 4 hours and given 2 more medications. One was a steroid, I?m unsure on the second.

I was light headed. Removing my scrub top was enough to make me pass out. My boyfriend called 911 and after monitoring me for 45 min, they determined that it was best to go to ER.  Heart rate was in 160s, Respiration was in the 60s, Carbon Dioxide was 11 and pulse ox was around 7%. They did EKG , CT Scan and they gave you oral Benzo. They told me that I probably got the vaccine too soon after COVID diagnosis, which I had in Dec.

                                                At 10:35 I started feeling weird in my body like when I get either an asthma attack or flu type. It was an hour later when I first began to feel lightheaded, dizzy, chills, and then really cold. I started then coughing hard like my throat was closing up and hard to breathe. My chest got tight and had sharp pains right under my chest by my stomach side. My heart rate was fast to the point my watch alerted me at over 135. I took my rescue ProAir inhaler to help but it didn?t. I tried to settle down and not panic to make things worse on my asthma attack. I then had to lay down feel weak. Within the next 15-20 min I used my nebulizer at home to help me breathe. After one treatment it helped me tremendously but still felt tired, nauseous, fatigue, pounding headache, but no fever since I barely checked at 98.5.

Took pt into the vaccination room, took her blood pressure ( 125/82). There was no rash or hives. Pt was alert, oriented but complained that her throat still felt tight and there was a knot. Pt was asked to remove the mask so we could check for edema. Her lower lip appeared very swollen. We told her that it could be an allergic reaction and needed to administer the EpiPen and call 911- pt received 1 dose of epi pen 0.3mg into the left thigh through clothing at aroung 12:30 pm .We called 911 and continued to monitor patient while waiting for EMs to arrive. Her second BP was  122/75 after the EpiPen and she said the knot was still in her throat. EMS arrived very shortly after and took over. They told her that they would take her to a hospital to monitor her.

Tightening of her throat later worsed and was associated with dysphagia.  Epi was administered and EMS contacted.  Pt&#39;s symptoms completely resolved before transport to the hospital.

After ER visit I was advised to take Zyrtec and Benadryl. I&#39;ve paired it with Mucinex to get rid of phlegm build-up and the doctor prescribed Prednisone which I&#39;m going to start today (03/15/2021). So far I have less tightness/less tingling in heart area (still occurs randomly but not as opten) but still get fatigued and breathless real quick. I&#39;ve also had sporadic headaches brain fog, body chills/aches/weakness/difficulty concentrating. Also had face numbness for 4 days.

                                                Woke up feeling nauseous/diarrhea at 1 am on Wednesday (approx. 60 hours after injection). Side note- on Tuesday (day after injection), I donated blood. Not sure if this is relevant. After waking up nauseous, I experience extreme shortness of breath and full body chills for roughly 30 seconds to 1 minute. I walked about 10 steps to wake up my partner and fainted instead. I woke up to him calling my name, and almost immediately threw up. Afterwards, I felt okay, only tired and a little weak. I was able to go back to sleep and woke the next day with no lingering side effects. I would say the entire episode lasted roughly 5 minutes.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 31-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left deltoid on 26Feb2021 15:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to opioids, Toradol, Valium, and a lot of foods; mast cell activation disorder, eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE), asthma, celiac disease, Hashimoto, and hypothyroidism. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), meloxicam (MOBIC), paracetamol (TYLENOL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that one min later after the vaccination (26Feb2021 15:16), the patient felt an &#34;aura&#34; (joints loosening, dizziness), gave herself two puffs of albuterol and pulled out her epi pen and called for help. Two mins later (26Feb2021 15:17), the patient experienced convulsions, bronchospasms, throat closure, dizziness, difficulty breathing. Two rounds of epi, non-rebreather O2, rescue efforts. The patient was then transferred to emergency department (ED) to continue rescue efforts. The patient was treated with O2, Ativan, Steroids, Epinephrine, and Benadryl. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid nasal swab PCR test: negative on 26Feb2021 (post vaccination). The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events, cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

My blood pressure was normal per the doctor and my breathing returned to normal per the doctor.

                                                Patient reports that she did not have any issues after the first Covid19 Pfizer vaccine but 5 minute after her second dose she felt like it was hard to swallow. She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

He told me to take medications prior to the second dose to reduce my symptoms for the second dose. I got my shot around 9:25am and around 9:40am or so I had shortness of breath and had to take my emergency inhaler. My throat felt itchy for at least 30 minute after.

We moved the patient to the sleep lab while waiting for the ER to come up. Patient started complaining she felt that her throat was closing. Her O2 was stable at 98/99. Her HR was over 100 bpm. When the ER team came up and put her in a wheel chair her upper lip was swelling and her arm was blotchy.   Patient did come up a few hours later to schedule her 2nd dose vaccine after she received a high dose IV Benadryl and Pepcid. She is going to speak to her PCP about this reaction and let me us know if she can take the 2nd dose.

                                                After first dose, arm soreness lasting 3 days, headache lasting an hour. After around 5 days, I thought it was stress related, but I started to have itchiness on the roof of my mouth at the back. There is a kind of rashy area in the back of my mouth, mostly on the roof. It itches a lot and it makes my throat hurt when I attempt to scratch it. I have had to use chloraseptic spray and numbing cough drops to ease the itch and pain. Also, I have been experiencing shortness of breath. I attributed it to Chronic Bronchitis, but it feels different and is not constant. I didn&#39;t make the connection of mild allergic reaction until I received my second dose. I received my second dose on 01/29/2021. I was experiencing flu-like symptoms on 1/30, and am not experiencing the same symptoms as of 1/31. I am, however, still experiencing the mouth rash and itching, and mild shortness of breath.

                                                Saturday, January 23rd I received my second COVID vaccination around noon. Later that day I developed the typical extremely sore arm.  Sunday January 24th: I started to feel just a general malaise and had some headaches, like I was coming down with something, but other than that felt fine.  Monday January 25th: I was at work and started developing a sore throat, chest tightness with some shortness of breath, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and minor chills, although I never had a fever.   Tuesday: symptoms were slightly worse  Wednesday January 27th: I went to work thinking all these symptoms were still just from the vaccine as I hadn&#39;t felt any sickness symptoms before getting the vaccine and hadn&#39;t had an exposure I was aware of. While at work, I asked other coworkers if they had any similar symptoms to the vaccine and was told I should call employee health since I was still having such bad symptoms and really didn&#39;t feel too great. I called the employee health line and told them all my current symptoms which were all the same still. They told me that the sore throat and chest tightness with shortness of breath were definitely not from the vaccine and to leave work and get tested. I did this and my test came back negative. Because I was still having bothersome chest tightness, the employee health line also told me to go to the ER, thinking it could be something else significant.   I went to the ER the night of January 27th to get my symptoms all checked out as told to. Everything came back ok and the ER doctor wanted me tested for COVID again Friday around the 48 hour mark to verify it wasn&#39;t the virus. She also told me that if it came back negative, she was sure it must be my reaction to the vaccine.  Thursday January 28th: I stayed home per guidelines from employee health and still had all the symptoms listed on Monday. After a two hour afternoon nap, I finally felt like I was turning the corner. My sore throat felt better besides a huge lump still in my throat and my chest tightness with shortness of breath subsided. I still had bad myalgias, fatigue, headaches and a general sense of not feeling so great.  Friday, January 29th: Feeling slightly better again, main symptom is bad myalgias, especially my neck and small lump in throat. I got retested around 12:30 pm and it came back negative for COVID as well as negative for strep.   Saturday: Feeling almost 100% better besides sore neck still.

Her shortness of breath and throat burning symptoms resolved almost immediately. She was then given 10mg of Cetirizine PO and transported via local EMS for evaluation at the Hospital ED.

WHEN 30 MINUTES WAS OVER I ASKED THE PATIENT IF SHE WAS FEELING OKAY. SHE STATED &#34;HER JOINTS FELT STIFF LIKE WHEN SHE TAKES AMOXICILLIN.&#34; QUESTIONED THE PATIENT IF SHE WAS LIGHTHEADED/DIZZY OR HAD TROUBLE BREATHING? PATIENT RESPONDED &#34;NO, JUST ACHY JOINTS AND SWEATING.&#34; AT THAT POINT SHE HAD ANAPHYLACTIC SYMPTOMS. INFORMED PATIENT I COULD GIVE HER SOME TYLENOL FOR THE PAIN. TOLD HER TO GO HOME AND RELAX. INFORMED PATIENT I WOULD CALL HER IN 30 MINUTES TO CHECK IN. 30 MINUTES LATER I CALLED PATIENT AND NO ANSWER AND LEFT VOICE MAIL. 1 HOUR LATER CALLED AGAIN AND NO ANSWER AND LEFT ANOTHER VOICEMAIL. PATIENT CALLED 2-3 HOURS AFTER GOING HOME STATING SHE REPORTED TO &#34;HOSPITAL.&#34; SAID SHE STARTED TO DEVELOP DIZZINESS, SWEATING, MORE JOINT PAIN, NAUSEA, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH &#34;BUT MAY BE DUE TO NERVOUSNESS.&#34; I ASKED PATIENT ABOUT RECONSIDERING SECOND DOSE OF VACCINE, BUT SHE THEN SAID &#34;THE HOSPITAL STILL RECOMMENDS ME GETTING THE SECOND DOSE.&#34; THEREFORE LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS NOT A REAL IMMUNE RESPONSE BUT A PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE.

This 32-year-old female patient (No pregnant) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: ER8737) on 05Apr2021 06:15 PM at single dose on Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was Immunocompromised, chronic migraines. Known allergies: Just seasonal allergies. Wheat and soy allergy, restricted diet. Concomitant medications (in two weeks) included fluticasone propionate (FLONASE) for allergies (nasal spray), mirtazapine (REMERON). No other vaccine in four weeks.

Swelling noticeably went down after the allergy medication and breathing returned to normal. On Tuesday, 13Apr2021, after about three days of flu-like symptoms (nauseau, tiredness, body aches), I was admitted to the ER with a complex migraine and parathesia in my right arm, though the shot was in my left arm, and the migraine was in my left side of my head. I feel that this was an allergic reaction that happened belatedly and is a much stronger reaction than anyone else I have seen take the same dose and the same vaccine. AE resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was Allergy medication from 08Apr2021 to 13Apr2021 two IV&#39;s &#43; Benadryl. Outcome of the event was Recovering.

                                                With in 10 mins of receiving  1st dose, I started to feel hot and light headed, my body became very hot, I started to sweat and then my throat started to dry up and close. I notified the provider on watch that was monitoring me during my 15 mins after injection and as the walked me to the room I became more and more dizzy, my throat continued to swell and close, my mask was removed where my face was covered with a rash and hives . The dr. Gave me 50 mg benedryl, and a shot of epinephrine.  After wards 911 was called, my heart rate was eventually brought down with the epinephrine as my symptoms began to be controlled. An inhaler was administered because I was short of breath. 3 hours later I was stabilized. I then was recommended to go to urgent care rather the emergency room since the wait was 13 hours to be monitored at the local hospital MLK. I went to urgent care near my home at Hoag hospital and they monitored me and gave me a steroid injection IM. I was discharged with an epi pen just in case abs to take benedryl every 6 hours . The following morning 1/8/21, at 8 am the swelling of my throat retuned I became light headed abs my tongue became numb. I was taken to fountain valley hospital where an IV was started, 500 mg of iv benedryl, another epinephrine injection was given abs I remained under surveillance for another 6 hours. They stated that a lot of people are coming with reoccurring episodes of anaphylaxis after the phizer injection.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

                                                12/20: 10 mins after the injection my arm started hurting so I was moving it around and suddenly a felt a tickle in my throat, swallowed and felt like I swallowed the wrong way and was coughing to the point of feeling like I was going to vomit. Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

                                                Day after vaccine I began to have tachycardia upon standing and walking. Heart rates are in the 140-170s when walking a normal pace. Resting heart rate is much higher than normal at around 100. When climbing stairs, heart rate gets into the high 170s. Shortness of breath and dizziness accompany standing, walking and climbing stairs. These symptoms still persist - have been ongoing from 11/12/21 - 11/22/21.

The redness and itching last 4-5 days. I had to stay on Benadryl and Zyrtec to help with the redness and itching.  My job sent me to the ER to be monitored after getting the shot until I went home.

                                                She had been over at the vaccine center getting the second dosage of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination and had gotten the vaccine and was sitting afterwards when she started feeling that her throat became tight and she was having a hard time breathing so she alerted the staff who quickly evaluated her and gave her an injection of epinephrine.  At that point she was transported over to our urgent care for me to evaluate her.  While in the urgent care she stated that she still felt that there was some tightness but generally felt better.  As I was examining her she said she started feeling that her throat was tightening up again and so we did give her an additional injection of epinephrine and within 5 minutes she again states that she is feeling tremendously better.  She never did have any wheezing or swelling of her tongue or her lips.  She has never had any prior reaction like this to a vaccination or injection

They placed me on a gurney, and the chills started getting so bad I was shaking and out of control and I was really cold. After about 25-30 minutes after I felt like my blood pressure dropped and I actually passed out and once I passed out I don&#39;t know how long I was out for. Maybe less than a minute, I couldn&#39;t breathe and I was hyperventilating and they put a oxygen mask on me. They took me to ER (Hospital) and I recognized I was in there when I &#34;woke up&#34; - they were trying to get an IV in me but I was shaking so much it took several attempts. They gave me several medications because I was nauseated as I wanted to vomit and they gave me anaphylactic medications. I was having chest pains. I fell asleep. They were going to admit me but I kind of refused to be admitted and they let me go with Zofran, prednisone and one other medication. One of coworker took me home. I slept the rest of the day and night. The next day, Really fatigued and chest pain was semi getting better. Breathing - was pretty okay after that. By day 3, I was fine.

I felt very light headed for the rest of the day. The light headedness and dizziness stayed for a few days with a headache. I did not have second dose on the recommendation of my doctor. I ended up contracted Covid-19 three weeks after the vaccine.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (COIVD-19 Vaccine) , via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 in 2020 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for Crohn&#39;s disease.  The reporter is a physician who is reporting and AE for a patient who received the vaccine and subsequently developed symptoms including short of breath, fever, headache, nausea, difficulty swallowing with seriousness criteria of Medically significant on 03Jan2021. The patient self-medicated with benadryl and symptoms resolved briefly but then went to urgent care with re-occurring symptoms and was prescribed prednisone. Caller states the patient&#39;s symptoms have resolved. She is calling to get more information to determine if the patient should receive the second dose. The reporter further stated that she has a patient who received her first shot, clarified as the COVID-19 Vaccine. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the patient had shortness of breath and then later had a fever, headache and nausea. It was later that night when the patient had a fever. The patient had difficulty swallowing which worsen; she was feeling as if her throat was closing. The patient is a nurse, so she self medicated with Benadryl. After taking the Benadryl, the patient was better in the early morning. When the doctor&#39;s office opened, the patient called and was having similar symptoms, clarified as all the symptoms mentioned above. The patient went to the urgent care where she received more Benadryl and was started on prednisone. Caller did not know the dose of prednisone the patient had received. After that, the patient started feeling better. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID19 Vaccine is due around 24 to 26Jan2021. The patient has not called the doctor/caller back. The caller assumes that the patient has recovered but could not be certain. Caller added that the patient also experienced chest tightness when she was having shortness of breath. The patient&#39;s fever was 101 on 03Jan2021. The patient was not drooling with her difficulty swallowing. Caller stated that the patient had a positive COVID test earlier, she thinks it was maybe 3 to 4 months ago (in 2020). The patient has not received another COVID test since she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to the caller&#39;s knowledge. Reporting physician is an internal medicine physician. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported short of breath, fever, headache, nausea, difficulty swallowing, throat closing, chest tightness, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the plausible temporal association.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

Drugs given: Z-pac for 5 day course.  40 mg QD of Prednisone for five more days. Cefdinir - 300 mg twice a day for 7 days. Was also given Codeine/Phenergan cough syrup to take three times a day as needed which has been needed. Still fighting it - cough is less and less productive. I feel like I have a couple of broken ribs on right that is making it challenging. Getting slightly better but affecting overall function. Have seen a provider four times.

                                                About 5 minutes after the vaccine, my tongue began tingling. I drank water but didn&#39;t tell anyone at the vaccine clinic. I did wait 17 minutes before leaving. I went to the car to look in the mirror and assess my oral airway. My tongue and pharynx were not swollen. I kept drinking water and proceeded to go home. About 10 minutes into my drive my throat became tight, so I went back and checked into the ER. My vitals were stable, and you couldn&#39;t see any swelling. My throat felt tight and my tongue tingly. I had already taken pepcid and zyrtec that morning, so they gave me Solumedrol and Benadryl IV. The tingling and tightness improved and went away by about 0930. It did return around 2300 that night (not as bad, just tongue tingly and slight tightening of my throat), and I took another pepcid and benadryl. I also had myalgias, felt febrile and fatigued for about 48 hours.  &#43;&#43;See previous VAERS report I did about vaccine #1

                                                No symptoms with first dose, but 10-15 minutes after receiving her second dose of Pfizer vaccine, her throat began to swell and she felt dizzy. EMS came to take her vitals and gave her oral Benadryl. The patient felt much better after 15 minutes. She said it was a similar reaction to when she is exposed to eggs or nuts.

                                                Received the vaccine, and was in the monitoring area.  Within ~5 minutes, I felt my throat was thickening.  I asked for water to see if that would help the sensation.  The sensation of thickness increased to a tightening and thickness and a very mild itchiness on the roof of my mouth.  I continued to feel a strong need to drink water and became extremely cold.  At about 20 minutes, my voice became hoarse.  I was given benadryl at approximately 40 minutes post injection, however the staff were communicating with people at the ER and was told that I needed an Epipen and to be transported immediately to the ER given signs of analphylaxis with the vocal change. I received the epipen about 45 minutes after injection, and a few minutes after receiving the shot, my throat felt looser. My voice continued to be hoarse. They had a very difficult time finding a vein in my arm for an IV (an I am typically very veiny).  I was transported to the ER, and given steriods and monitored.  At approximately 4 hrs post vaccine, I started to have worsening voice again, in which they gave me additional benadryl.  I continued to be monitored in the ER until 7 hrs post vaccine.  My voice continued to have moments where it was better and then it would go away again.  They offered to keep me for observation, however I declined and was discharged to home.  At home, later that night, I developed entire body itchiness, particularly over my face, and trunk.  This lasted for several days, with decreasing intensity.  My face was also very flushed looking lasting for 2 days after the reaction.  My voice returned to normal after 3 days.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on Thursday, morning (11Feb2021), at the time her arm hurt. She had body aches the entire Friday (12Feb2021) and headache; she stayed in bed all day and the next day, she took Tylenol. On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I had fast heart palpitations that it woke me up,  when I woke up I had difficulty breathing and felt Severe chess pain. I felt pressure and started coughing a lot. My husband helped me with some breathing exercises and helped me call online 24 hour Kaiser nurse. My chest hurt a lot and  they recommended I went to emergency. I did and they said x-ray and cardiogram was ok. They injected a pain killer and left me there until morning. Then I was released. Pain killer helped. On Friday evening I had no more chest pain, but I felt nauseous, had chills, body aches, headache and no appetite. These symptoms lasted until Monday. I started to eat again bread and butter by Tuesday, I deleted better on Tuesday, I was still  very fatigue, low energy and sensitive stomach, mild nausea. Nausea  stopped Wednesday, stomach was still mild sensitive still.

                                                I got the first COVID vaccine on March 8th. The next day, I  had a rash on my chest and thighs that became hives. The hives were hot and itchy. This reaction gradually grew worse and the rash spread to the rest of my legs, down my arms, and to my belly.  When it started up my neck, I noticed that my throat was getting a bit sore and tight. I called my primary care provider and she told me to go to the ER.  The ER providers drew blood, which was normal except for low potassium and elevated red blood cells. They treated me with IV Benadryl and steroids, which caused the symptoms to dissipate quickly. The doctor also prescribed Pepcid and an epipen.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported for a 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administration in left arm on 18Mar2021 11:45 (at the age of 34-year-old) (Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had allergies to Sulfa antibiotics, Lumbar disc herniation, keratosis pilaris, acne. Occasionally the patient drinks alcohol.  Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ ferrous fumarate/ norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE) spironolactone, ethinylestradiol, norethisterone acetate (AUROVELA), acetominophen and ibuprofen.. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had a reaction a severe allergic reaction to the COVID 19 vaccine on 18Mar2021 at 11:45 . It was reported within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine the patient started to get hot, heart started racing, a facial redness, face got bright red and swollen, throat started to swell, and it was difficult to swallow. The patient heart rate went up to 127 and blood pressure up to 170 within a few minutes after getting vaccine. The patient heart rate and blood pressure were high. The patient also experienced inflamed tonsils.  On 18Mar2021 at 11:52 the patient experienced also: sore throat, shortness of breath and chest tightness, at 12:00 the patient had mild facial erythema flushing and at an unknown time fever up to 99.5°F. All these with outcome of unknown. The patient was not in anaphylactic shock, but she was initially given diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) to treat the symptoms, but it had no effect. She was admitted to emergency room and was given epinephrine and prednisone and things started to get better. The next day symptoms returned, and patient went to urgent care the next morning. There the patient received another prescription for prednisone for 5 days. After that finished her symptoms returned and was given another round of prednisone for 6 days. The patient was still having slight symptoms that she was treating with fexofenadine (ALLEGRA) twice per day per advice of allergist. The patient was met with an allergist and was slightly concerned and thought it was unusual that this would continue past symptoms of 2 weeks. It was reported that the patient was experiencing slight symptoms, nothing crazy, but was wondering what communication from Pfizer was if someone did have an allergic reaction that most people were treated in emergency room. On an unknown date, the patient had allergy tests and no information found on allergy tests. It was reported that the patient antibody testing was not currently recommended to assess for immunity. The patient was discharged with instructions to get an epi pen in case anything got crazy, and her husband drove her home. It was stated as soon as it was her turn the system disconnected. The patient stated the only reason she waited after 4 hours was because she was 5th in line, and it took 2 hours 50 minutes to get to be her turn. The patient was on hold for four hours and she got hung up on, but she was not sure if the system was down, but she got an email and, in the case, it had her interactions. Among the Vaccine recipients, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site within 7 days after an injection was the most reported local reaction, with less than 1% of participants. In general, local side effects; the ones you get on the arm where you got the shot (such as injection site redness and injection site swelling) were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days. Side effects that you may experience throughout the rest of your body; (systemic side effects) including fever and chills were observed with the first 1 to 2 days after vaccination and resolved shortly thereafter. Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), which generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited immune response. A cross all age groups reporting severe pain. Since the vaccination the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient was suggested  not to get the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination of any type.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.  Follow-up (27Apr2021): This is a follow-up spontaneous report from a contactable Pharmacist. New information included: patient medical history, concomitant medications, new non serious adverse event (sore throat, shortness of breath and chest tightness, mild facial erythema flushing and fever up to 99.5°F.); Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I am an APRN, and received the vaccine not quite one week ago. I waited 15 minutes within the facility and then left. Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

I also had a metal taste in my mouth. Before the rapid heart rate started, j bad chills, diarrhea and slight body aches. For about four to five hours my heart rate resting would be 60&#39;s and when a spell came on it would rise up to high 90&#39;s. It did this off and on every couple of minutes for about four to five hours. It was a very scary situation to be in: I can handle the chills, bod aches and diarrhea but when it comes to my heart rate bouncing around and taking my breath away, that was scary.

                                                Received first dose of Pfizer covid vaccine yesterday, 1/28. Dose given at 1:48pm. She was in the observation room for 5 minutes when she developed itching on hands and then noticed hands were red, spread to arms, then chest and neck started itching. Took vitals, blood pressure was high, she attributes to anxiety, acknowledges that she was nervous about getting vaccine.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wed night 1/31/21 at 5:50pm. I had no prior recent illnesses prior to getting the shot. About 24 hours later, developed fevers/chills, body aches, headaches, and fatigue, and a notable pain in the front of neck -- felt like tender thyroid. Temp was 100.3F on Thursday night 1/14. Took ibuprofen and went to bed. Next day felt fine, went to work, but symptoms returned on Friday night without fever. Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.

                                                Reported information from patient: I had a severe reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.  Met with Dr. and did a series of skin testing for PEG allergy.  All were negative and progressed to a microdose of the vaccine.  Continued to have no reaction so remaining dose was administered.  I waited 2 hours in clinic and experienced some mild pruritic symptoms.  Took 2 zytrtec and went home.  the next day experienced some throat swelling with shortness of breath.  Took additional allergy medication and contacted Dr.  He prescribed prednisone and up to 4 allergy tabs a day.  I developed increased shortness of breath, hives on my tongue which developed into ulcerations.  The waves of throat swelling would come every 4 hours or so.  Was able to manage with oral agents, did not administer the prescribed epi-pen.  These symptoms started on that Tuesday and were severe enough to keep me home from work until Feb 15th (I work Monday/Wednesday).  Throat swelling and coughing persists but it markedly improved.   Now understand I have a non-IGE mediated allergy to PEG.   Patient wanted to receive the COVID vaccine so was seen by an allergist given previous history of possible polyethylene glycol allergy.  Following review and discussion of risks patient was scheduled to receive a test dose.  Provider notes as follows:  She has had several occasions where she has developed shortness of breath and &#34;generally not feeling well,&#34; within 1 to 2 hours of taking MiraLAX.  She has not had any reactions to any prior injectable medications or vaccinations.  Due to this MiraLAX potential allergy there is a contraindication to receiving the Pfizer or my during a Covid vaccine.  What I have recommended since she would like to be vaccinated is to have her to return to clinic at which time we will do skin testing with skin prick and intradermal to polyethylene glycol as well as polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80.  If the allergy testing to polyethylene clean glycol is negative we will then give her graded dosing of the COVID-19 vaccine and monitor her in clinic.  If the polyethylene glycol is positive but the polysorbate testing are negative she may be a candidate for receiving one of the newer vaccines which are yet to be on the market.     The patient was seen today for a new problem which is polyethylene glycol allergy and the need for COVID-19 vaccination.  She will return for testing to the vaccine components and then intramuscular graded challenge if necessary.     Prior to the graded challenge skin prick testing to MiraLAX was completed which was negative.  Skin prick testing and intradermal testing was also completed for Solu-Medrol, Depo-Medrol and triamcinolone.  The Depo-Medrol contains polyethylene glycol, the triamcinolone contains polysorbate 80 and the Solu-Medrol functions as a control without any polyethylene glycol or polysorbate.  All skin prick and intradermal testing was negative.  An ~10% dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was given and the patient was monitored for 30 minutes. The remaining ~90% of the COVID-19 vaccine was then given  and the patient was monitored for an additional 90 minutes. The patient received pre-medications with: Zyrtec and Tylenol

Patient is scheduled to receive the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021 but reported side effects from her first shot including bruising near the injection site, shortness of breath, muscle tenderness and elevated heart rate (main concern). Upon contacting her HCP, she mentioned that this may be a side effect of her anxiety medications and asked &#34;Should she take the second dose?&#34;. Approximately 22hours (13Jan2021) after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. COVID-19 vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy, also experienced blood pressure increased, shortness of breath and Clammy, all on 13Jan2021. The patient was pale on 13Dec2020. Patient noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) that the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender (onset reported as &#34;Jan2021&#34;). Patient became sweaty on 14Jan2021. It was further reported that patient received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021 2:30PM . She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site. She said her COVID-19 Vaccine was given a lot higher than she thinks the vaccine should have been given. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy. Her heart rate and blood pressure shot up, and she had pretty bad shortness of breath. Patient said that the medical doctor and nurse practitioner (where she works) told her she gave herself a panic attack. She said that the medical doctor, who she works for, told her to go home, and to contact her primary care doctor if she doesn&#39;t feel better. Patient left work and went home. Patient clarified her heart rate was in the 120s, and she usually has a heart rate in the 80s. She said she was pale and clammy, too. Patient stated that she went to bed when she got home from work on 13Jan2021, and woke up the next morning (Thursday, 14Jan2021), and got ready for work. She said as she was getting dressed for work, she felt her pulse rate go up, and she became sweaty, and clammy. She said she called her work, and her boss (medical doctor) told her to take some Tylenol and rest, and to call her primary care doctor if she was not feeling better. Patient said that her primary care doctor said she was having anxiety, and started her on medicine. She said the medicine helped, but her heart rate was still 112-115. She said she noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender. She said all the muscles in her left arm were tender, as well. She said her left arm muscles were still aching. She said she had bruising on her left arm, and noticed she had bruising (more than usual) throughout the rest of her body. She said she has no idea if the bruising is a coincidence, or if the bruising is related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned that her left axillary lymph nodes were swollen for a good week and a half, but the swelling improved and was gone now. She said her heart rate was still elevated at 106-110 when she last checked her heart rate an hour and half ago. She said her heart rate was elevated, even though she was sitting down doing tele-work, and she has been taking anxiety medicine. She said she was still having breathing discomfort, clarifying she could not take a big enough breath. Patient will take a big breath, and will be good for a while, but then she needs to take another big breath. She said her doctor has checked her lungs, and her lungs were clear. She said she has to take multiple, deep breaths throughout the day. Patient&#39;s last blood work was in Oct2020. She said everything was good with her blood work. She said her hormones were good, but she had a Vitamin D deficiency. For treatment, patient stated that her primary care doctor prescribed Buspar 7.5mg, twice a day. She said the Buspar 7.5mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle and did not have the NCD, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said it will be 3 weeks from tomorrow (03Feb2021) she has been taking the Buspar 7.5mg and reported everyone seems to think she has anxiety, or she was crazy. Events did not require emergency room visit but patient visited physician office. There were no relevant tests. Outcome of muscles in her left arm were tender/aching, was not recovered, for axillary lymph nodes swelling and tender was recovered in 2021, for heart rate was elevated, Shortness of breath/breathing discomfort was recovering while for other events was unknown.

Then I went to the ER and they have me a steroid and  Pepcid. I went home, and I was still very itchy. Then I went to urgent care and they repeated the treatment and I was fine by the 3rd day. I went to see my allergist and he wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to the vaccine. I was instructed to take the 2nd dose, but to take meds first. I took antihistamines before 2nd dose and I was fine.

                                                Six days after receiving vaccine, began feeling unwell. Symptoms are extreme fatigue, red eyes, sore eyes, body aches, joint pain, pain around back/ribs, shortness of breath on exertion. Unable to do usual household tasks and requiring bedrest for much of the day.   The symptoms are very similar to the waves of symptoms I experienced early on in Post-Acute Covid-19 syndrome. I got sick in March and was experiencing waves like this through November. Since November, my physical symptoms had abated and I had not suffered a major relapse like this, besides a mild relapse at end of January. My shortness of breath issues, back pain/rib pain, eye soreness are very specific symptoms that I associate with early on in my long covid experience. The vaccine seems to have triggered a major relapse in my long covid symptoms.

Treated with Motrin and rest. Also experienced tightness /pressure in chest/lungs  with deep breaths similar to the feeling of running in cold air.  That has continued for 24&#43; hours and I still have that.

EMS was called and epinephrine/diphenhydramine administered for course cough/wheezing, presumably anaphylaxis. Other foods consumed by baby on same day included banana, kids ?g newton bar, dried apples, meat from frozen meal, and two piece of cereal (new to baby). ER course required 4 hours of monitoring but no other medical interventions.

                                                It did not manifest in a normal way- I started coughing and needed my inhaler, proceeded to feel as if my legs were covered in fire ant bites and swollen, the skin all over my body itched to the point that I broke the skin, my face became bright red and hivey, and my throat began to tighten as if someone were choking me. The only reason I did not use my Epipen was the fact that I could still breathe through this, even if it was a bit labored. I should add that my reaction began 1.5 hours after I was vaccinated. I?ve been managing having life threatening allergies since I was a child, but this reaction resembled nothing I?ve ever experienced.  After using 50 mg of Benadryl, my symptoms were manageable. The pain at the injection site lasted for five days and caused intermittent numbness to my pinky finger and up my neck.

                                                I was completely okay health wise and had no current asthma episodes, and after receiving the 2nd dose vaccine later in the night I started to feel Short of breath, chills, sore throat, wheezing, and ultimately after trying to get through it I ended up in emergency room on 2/8/2021. I have been sick since then and still have not recovered. I can&#39;t even work because I can&#39;t breathe and still have wheezing. Currently on Prednisone daily and it&#39;s now been 7 weeks. I&#39;ve never had this happen.

A 35-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: ER8734) at single dose on 06Apr2021 12:00 in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia; asthma (controlled). Patient had known allergies to CT contrast and codeine (when taken with albuterol). Concomitant medications in two weeks included pregabalin (LYRICA), baclofen, nortriptyline, vitamin D3. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. Patient got the shot and felt a little tingly and sat down for 15 mins and could not stand up because she was too dizzy. Her daughter (also there receiving the shot) grabbed paramedics to check if this was common. The paramedics helped walk her to their triage room set up maybe 50 yards away. By the time they got there, patient was breaking out in hives on her face and chest. The paramedics started setting up an IV and that was when her throat started closing. Patient was given a shot of EPI while they finished the IV and gave her a bunch of other things in the IV. Patient got another shot of EPI in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and was put on an EPI drip while admitted. Patient stayed in the hospital while they tried several times to take her off EPI, but was not successful until the end of the third day (Thursday night) when she was sent home. Patient returned to hospital Monday and currently still under medical care at home. All adverse events start date was 06Apr2021 12:00. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The seriousness criteria was hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient was hospitalized 3 days for the events, treatment included medication intervention. There was no covid prior vaccination, covid was tested post vaccination. Novel corona virus test via nasal swab on 13Jun2020 and 22Jun2020 were both negative; COVID-19 RT PCR via nasal swab on 21Jan2021 was negative. The outcome of events was recovering.

Medical history included mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed in 2019, autoimmune disorder and anxiety from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included diazepam (VALIUM) taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; paracetamol (TYLENOL A) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps (arrhythmia) on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered  sob and dates for getting really winded (dyspnoea)  on Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, her heart was racing on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really winded on 22Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, for the 4-5 days after receiving her covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30am since it started on 20mar2021 with outcome of unknown, extremely thirsty on 20Mar2021 with outcome of unknown,  low grade fevers  on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Additional details were provided as: &#34;I started having a reaction within 12 hours of the shot that persisted. Four (4) days after I was at urgent care and was sent to see a cardiologist due to SOB and heart rate jumps that were happening.&#34; In the past two weeks the patient has seen the cardiologist, had ekgs and echos completed and and now is being sent to see an electrophysiologist. The cardiologist wants her to postpone the second dose until she sees the electrophysiologist since he doesn&#39;t know if this is exacerbation of something or was caused by the vaccine. She had her first dose on 19Mar2021 around 12:45PM-1:00PM in the afternoon. After her vaccine she was ok. She had actually taken a Valium before she went to get the Covid 19 vaccine because she was nervous. She doesn&#39;t know if taking the Valium before getting the Covid 19 vaccine had anything to do with her delayed reaction. She does not take the Valium every day. She woke up around 1:30AM Saturday morning, 20Mar2021 and her heart was racing. Her mother is a nurse and her mother came over the next day to monitor her. Her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps. Even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s. (beats per minute) She and her mother monitored her heart for a while and she called the clinic where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and the nurse told her to go to an Urgent Care. She does report she has an autoimmune disease and she was wondering if she was having a flare up that the Covid 19 vaccine had caused. She could not find a doctor to talk to her about it. Even her primary care doctor wouldn&#39;t help her. Everyone told her to go to an Urgent Care or the emergency room. On Monday, 22Mar2021, she tried to get up and move around but she was getting really winded. She was trying to do things she normally does like walking in her backyard or walking down the hallway. On Tuesday, 23Mar2021 she went to the urgent care. The urgent care did an EKG and told her she needed to see a cardiologist. She was able to see a cardiologist the next day on Tuesday, 24Mar2021. The cardiologist had her wear a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rate for 24 hours. The results showed that she was having arrhythmias, heart rate jumps. The cardiologist did more EKG&#39;s and an echocardiogram. The cardiologist wants her to see an electrophysiologist because of what he saw on the Holter monitor. She is asking if it&#39;s possible that she had a heart issue before and the Covid 19 vaccine brought it to the surface. She&#39;s read things online where people have had similar symptoms. Is it a side effect? She would also like to report that for the 4-5 days after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30AM since it started on 20Mar2021. She&#39;s unsure if she should get the second Covid 19 vaccine. Her second appointment is scheduled for this Friday, 09Apr2021. When she woke up that morning of 20Mar2021 she was extremely thirsty. She reports she does not drink alcohol because of her autoimmune disease, but the thirst she experienced felt like she had been drinking alcohol and was experiencing the extreme thirst that comes with a hangover. The first 5 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine were the worst and that&#39;s why she decided to go to the urgent care. Her heartrate hasn&#39;t improved. Her windedness had improved by the tenth or eleventh day. She can go on a walk and jump up and down with her daughter now. The windedness is lingering a little but is definitely improved. Her autoimmune disease is called Mixed Connective Tissue. She takes no medications for it. She manages it with her diet. Her mother had called her rheumatologist on call on Monday night, 22Mar2021 and asked him is there anything the caller can do or anything she can take. The rheumatologist on call told her to take Aleve.  She didn&#39;t take Aleve but she did take Tylenol and then hours later she took Advil. She does normally run low grade fevers with her autoimmune disease. The fevers are never high, usually around 99.8F never going over 100F. The low grade fevers have been occurring prior to the Covid 19 vaccine for years. She reports that after she took the Tylenol (Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, she took 2 tablets) and then the Advil (Advil 200mg, she took 1 tablet), she felt drugged, like totally out of it. So tired she couldn&#39;t move. And she&#39;s taken those medications before and never felt like that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: arrhythmias, heart rate jumps   on 23Mar2021. No follow-up attempts are possible; no further information expected.

A 36-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730) dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included von willebrand&#39;s disease, narcolepsy with cataplexy, IIH (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension), HTN (hypertension), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), migraines. Patient also had known allergies: PCN (penicillin), shellfish, IV contrast, cefdinir and bees. On 23Dec2020, patient got nerve blocks for her migraines. Throughout the day patient was cough and her face started flushing so she tooled diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Around 22:30, patient felt like her throat was closing and she was choking. She had chest pain, chest tightness. EMS (emergency medical services) was called and patient was brought to the hospital. On 25Dec2020, patient felt like her throat was closing, like someone was sitting on her chest and chest tightness still with chest pain. Very SOB (shortness of breath) at rest. Patient went to the ER (emergency room) and received IV dexamethasone (DECADRON) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride. On 26Dec2020, patient had the same symptoms but with severe facial flushing and patient went back to the ER and was given IV dexamethasone. Patient was sent home on a maximum amount of medications. I had seen her primary care, ENT (ear nose throat centre), Allergy, ID (infectious disease), and pulmonology. Her CT (computerised tomogram) of chest on 25Dec2020 was negative along with her COVID test. Patient SOB on rest and exertion still. Onset date of the adverse events was reported as 23Dec2020, 22:30. Patient received treatment for the events included multiple medications and high dose prednisone. Lab data on 25Dec2020 included CT of chest: negative, influenza type A/B combo: negative, Covid 19: negative and nasal swab: negative. Action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship.  The clinical presentation of the events is suggestive of possible allergic reactions. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient experienced a syncopal episode post vaccination, accompanied by feeling hot and tachycardic. Prior to the syncope, she reported hyperventilating. She remained unresponsive for about 10 minutes and was brought to the ED. There she became responsive, and reported chest pain and had sinus tachycardia episodes. She also had lower extremity weakness. This has improved per the latest neurology notes. She also had a negative EEG. Unsure if this is an allergic reaction or if the syncope was due to hyperventilation.  Patient is currently on day 3 of hospitalization.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

Symptoms were the same as they were after my first dose, so I&#39;m managing them at home with Benadryl, warm packs, soft food and liquids and continuing to monitor at home. No respiratory issues to note. I met with my PCP after my reaction to the first dose. He suspects lymphedema in response to the vaccine. I waited until all symptoms were clear to receive my second dose per my PCPs instructions.

Today upon waking tightness in chest felt intensified and continues now (evening). Midday experienced sudden vertigo and double vision lasting over a minute along with dizziness. I had already eaten lunch. Primary Dr ordered me to emergency room. Extensive testing along with chest x-ray and EKG performed. No abnormalities were found.  ED doctor said a State test of some sort would tell us if it is an actual allergic reaction or an intensive immune response. He said it would take a few days for results.  I was given diagnosis of vaccine reaction and sent home for rest. Advised to return if symptoms get worse. Tightness in chest continues at this time. Fatigue and headache have also returned.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded.

Medical history included known allergies: Apple, pear, peach, pineapple, mango, avocado and almonds. Concomitant medications included unspecified multivitamins. No other vaccine in four weeks.

The nurse immediately gave her the epi pen and Benadryl. She had to rush to the ER. When she got there, she needed to have the second round of epi pen and more Benadryl. Events resulted in life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). No covid prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Nasal Swab on 25Jan2021 with result of negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events cough, throat swelling and difficulty breathing.

She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

                                                I received my vaccine at 1:10pm. As I was waiting afterwards, I started getting really itchy around 1:25pm. I have a lot of medicinal allergies and this is my normal response when I have a reaction. The itching gradually got worse and some swelling started as well. Around 1:45pm my throat started swelling and I was having trouble swallowing. This continued to get worse, so I stopped at the ER on my way home. I was given Benadryl in an IV and observed for 2 hours. The swelling in my throat went down by 2:45, but the itchiness continued until around 5pm. That evening, the only symptom left was fatigue.

There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including physical examination with vitals and chest x-ray, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent.

As such per the guidance I remained in the waiting room for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I had a light rash on both forearms and near the injection site on my left upper arm. I felt fine otherwise. I went up to the nurse in the monitoring room and showed her the rash. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. At the time I was not. She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated. It proceeded to get worse and when I looked at my throat in the mirror it was very red and starting to be visibly swollen. I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in to the emergency room.

At 7 minutes after my vaccination,  I approached EMS to report my symptoms to EMS. EMS did an exam and said my lymnode on my left side was a little swollen. Pharmacist took my name and number for contact information. Benadryl (25 mg) was given to me from the Giant Eagle Pharmacist  after seeing EMS at 8:55 AM. Waited an additional 30 minutes with EMS to monitor symptoms. Symptoms decreased in severity after Benadryl  (25 mg) was given.  ?Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;

At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

Approximately 15-20 minutes after dose was administered I began feeling a reaction. The skin on my face, neck, and chest became red, flushed, warm, splotchy, and itchy. My tongue and throat began to feel swollen/tight. I was also lightheaded and dizzy. My husband was driving the car and we almost returned to the vaccination site, but after approximately 5 more minutes, the tightness in my throat subsided, so we continued to go home. The flushing and lightheaded-ness went away after approximately 20 minutes. This is similar to the reactions I had just before I discontinued taking copaxone (approx. 2 years ago). I did not feel this way after dose one of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

I had the nurses look at my petechiae that had developed, then had me sit for another 15 mins. During that time, I began to develop heart palpitations and chest discomfort. They had me sit in another room and evaluated me. My blood pressure was high in the 140&#39;s systolic, which is abnormal for me, I?m usually 110 systolic. I began to have some shortness of breath; I wasn&#39;t able to take a deep breath. I was taken to the ED to be evaluated for my symptoms. There I was asked a series of questions, they had taken an EKG and my blood pressure was 151 systolic, then was taken to a triage room. MD ran a series of blood work and was given SOLU-Medrol IV push for my allergic reaction and Shortness of breath. I was kept in the ED for about 4 hours. Labs came back normal and was prescribed 20 mg Prednisone by mouth and 25mg Benadryl by mouth to take at home. My diagnose was Allergic reaction, Initial encounter. I was to follow up with my PCP. Followed up with my PCP the following day, 3/12/21 and she had run a CMP and CBC, looked at my petechia and referring me to Oncologist/hematologist to further evaluated for my platelet count and petechiae. She wants to make sure I won&#39;t be developing ITP.

The next day I had severe pain in arm, armpit, left breast and center chest along with stabbing pains in my back and neck.  I felt very dizzy, weak, exhausted and nauseated. I was having difficulty breathing and my blood pressure was 145 over 95 with a pulse of 120.  The third day I did not feel as ill but still had severe pain in armpit and chest. Today, I feel okay but still having pain in my armpit.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 06Apr2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included topiramate (TOPAMAX) at 250 mg, daily (2 DF 100mg and 1 DF 50mg at bedtime) taken for migraine, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that since the second vaccination experienced tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath and basically blasting of air, difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness, all on 18Jan2021. She reported pulse keeps raising, elevating to 148-157, she had palpitation complications without doing anything straight away. Elevated pulse and tachycardia, that all started and that was very concerning, pulse went to 209 and that was when she got transported to the emergency room. The patient reported also syncope episodes, costochondritis and chest pain on Jan2021.  On 26Mar2021 the patient experienced having discoloration on her toes, numbness and tingling and that her extremities, from the knee down and both her hands and feet were cold, ice cold. The patient was transported to the hospital by ambulance three times due to the events (hospitalizations on 22Jan2021, 30Jan2021 and 25Mar2021). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Troponin, D dimer, electrocardiogram (EKG), Chest X ray, Full blood count (CBC), exercise electrocardiogram (TMT) all resulted: normal, nuclear stress test: unknown results and pulse 148-157, 209,  all on unspecified date. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the second of two cases.  A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via intramuscular route administered in arm  on 13Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose (dose 1) and then via intramuscular route administered in arm on 03Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose (dose 2), for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has received both doses of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Medical history included Down&#39;s syndrome from 15Sep1984, morbid obesity and asthma since 2011 (Diagnosed 10 years ago), all were ongoing; and not a smoker/former smoker. Ongoing concomitant medications included loratadine (CLARITIN), paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) and birth control. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 09Apr2021, the patient tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021. On the same day on 09Apr2021, the patient experienced hypoxia, fatigue, fluid in both lungs, loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well. The patient (who had Downs Syndrome not that it matters but it is a co-morbidity/ Daughter has downs) and the patient&#39;s mother (reporter) had their second doses on 03Apr2021 which was a Saturday and her daughter ended up in the hospital on Friday 09Apr2021 and tested positive for Covid. The patient was admitted with hypoxia. The patient&#39;s mother has questions for the timelines for their infections. She doesn&#39;t know if they were possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine thousands of other people. The patient&#39;s mother stated that it has mostly resolved now, and they were all home. It started with fatigue and loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she took her to the doctor at 08:00 and she was at the emergency room (ER) by 08:30 and hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The events required visit to Emergency Room and Physician&#39;s office. Treatment included Remdesivir, Steroid Injection and Oxygen. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Data Capture Aid included the following information: The patient had a positive test for SARS-CoV2. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. The patient was hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at hospital discharge. The patient displayed clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness including Oxygen Saturation on Admission was 83% on Room Air. The patient required supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO). New or worsened symptoms/signs during the COVID-19 illness experienced (including date of onset/worsening) were Respiratory: Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs and Dyspnea. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19 including 5 Doses of Remdesivir starting 09Apr2021 and ending 13Apr2021. The reporter stated that she thinks they gave her a steroid injection in the ER. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. The patient&#39;s outcome with COVID-19 was recovering. Patient has not had a repeat test. The patient had numerous Lab work.  The patient was not a smoker/former smoker. The patient was taking medications routinely prior to the event being reported including Paxil, Claritin and Birth Control Pill. Pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection including Asthma. The patient was not treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent lab test and procedures including a Covid Test: Positive on 09Apr2021. The relatedness of drug to the events &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs&#34; was unknown (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter/ Method of assessment: Global Introspection). Causality was unknown because she doesn&#39;t know when they were exposed to the Covid. The reporter thinks the vaccine lessened their symptoms. Reporter seriousness for &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs (medically significant)&#34; was serious (hospitalization from 09Apr2021 to 13 Apr2021). Events Fatigue and Loss of Appetite were assessed as not serious by reporter. The outcome of the events Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs, Loss of Appetite, she wasn&#39;t feeling well, COVID-19, dyspnea and Asthma aggravated was recovering and unknown outcome for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, vaccination failure of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. Events hypoxia, pulmonary edema and dyspnea are attributed to Covid-19 infection and considered unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8737), administered in left arm on 01Apr2021 01:15 PM (at the age of 36-year-old) at single dose for so she could be protected from COVID (as reported). It was reported that vaccine was not administered at military facility and vaccination facility type was hospital (reported as patient drove up to vaccine clinic). The patient&#39;s medical history included acute lymphocytic leukemia from 1992 to 1996 and not ongoing (she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor). No family medical history relevant to events was reported. The patient declined being sick at the time of vaccination. No patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported. No prior vaccinations reported within four weeks. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient previously took gentamycin, amoxicillin and flu shot, culture specific to the flu (as reported), and she experienced allergy with all three on 1996. Patient said that she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor. She said that right after remission she developed a gentamycin allergy and, because of the gentamycin and amoxicillin allergy she was allergic to the flu shot, not the flu but the egg culture, because the egg culture can be that reaction. Patient also said that she had a reaction to a flu shot back in 1996 or something, it was the same rash that was with the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient had her first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 01Apr2021. She reported side effects of heavy breathing, racing heart, feeling woozy, rash, and pain at the injection site. It was reported that she would like more information and she wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. Patient had both an event to report and a question. She said she had done application, the first vaccine was 2 weeks before the present report and she was not supposed to get the second until this Thursday (19Apr2021), she needed to look at a calendar. She said 01Apr2021 was her first vaccine and that she did already report her events. She said she had a bad reaction that borderline sent her to the emergency room but she instead took a BENADRYL and she laid down and then felt really really really poor the next 5 days. She said she had a terrible reaction, she didn&#39;t feel like her throat was shut, her breathing was heavy, her voice was deep, her heart was racing, like she really had to work to breathe, not like losing her airway passage, just that she had to work to breathe, she had a heavy chest, chest pain, a racing heart. She said she could best correlate it to how feels like low blood sugar, like you are going to pass out. It was also reported that patient experienced woozy, about to pass out. She said she ended up what she&#39;d call a vascular rash. She said it started in the thighs and spread down her legs. She said it was not a rash at the injection site, the rash was under the skin rather than a topical rash. She said she had a photo of it, that it seems like a vascular reaction. She would like to file a report with us because she said she felt like she did not get anything out, she had logged what happened to them and there was no correlation, no confirmation. She said she could send the photo to them. She said she was scared to get second vaccine, she wonders if she should do her due diligence to do second dose, or if she should skip it. She said there was no protocol in place, she had a telemedicine call with her doctor, there was no $200 fee due, her physician said it sounds like patient had more than a normal reaction. She said there were other things that are scary, her doctor told her she should speak to an allergist, but she said it would cost her like $600. She said she didn&#39;t feel good on immediate injection, she felt like she probably shouldn&#39;t be driving her car. She looked for her notes then she said her only normal reaction was a super painful injection site but not a rash. She said the vascular rash subsided with the use of BENADRYL. She said she could not afford an allergist to figure out what&#39;s going on. She asked why someone as small as her would get the same dose as a 200 pound man and why the doses of the vaccine were not specific to size or weight based. She also asked if based on symptoms will someone in the medical Information department advised her not to get the second dose. Events onset date were reported as 01Apr2021. The case was reported as non-serious by the consumer. No events required emergency room visit. She confirmed that she did have a telehealth meeting with her general practitioner (also reported as no events required physician office visit), she said she talked to them on the phone. No investigations assessment and relevant tests were reported. The outcome of events was resolved on 02Apr2021 for &#34;rash/ rash was under the skin/ it started in the thighs and spread down her legs&#34; and &#34;vascular rash/ rash was under the skin/ it started in the thighs and spread down her legs/ it seems like a vascular reaction&#34;, resolved on 08Apr2021 for &#34;heavy breathing/breathing was heavy, voice was deep, like she really had to work to breathe&#34; and &#34;voice was deep&#34;, and resolved on 05Apr2021 for all other events.

This consumer (patient) reported for herself that a 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP7533) at the age of 36-years, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included had a pregnancy (a while ago, not ongoing). No other products. The patient stated that she experienced shortness of breath on 08Apr2021 (4 days after receiving the first dose), it got so severe on day 7 that she went to the ER on 11Apr2021. She started getting progressively more shortness of breath. Twice, she called the nurse line for her doctor and was advised to go to the emergency room. Added she could not catch her breath, and it was worse at night, could not sleep, so she went to the emergency room, she was in emergency room for 2 and a half hours and then went home. She wanted to know if the second dose could cause issues or if she should get it, added that the paperwork said that people should not get the vaccine if they received an adverse reaction to the first dose or any vaccination. She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. She was not sure whether progressively worsening shortness of breath had gotten any better or was still going on, added that yesterday was the day she did not need either treatment medication. The day before, she took just the anxiety medicine and not the albuterol. Yesterday, she took none. During the day on 11Apr2021 (Sunday), she had called because she was feeling uncomfortable constantly. She has two children and all day she did not feel well. She told her husband she did not feel well at all. Sunday when she went to lay down, she could not sleep. Patient reported that as her shortness of breath subsided, her arm started hurting again, thought this began on 19Apr2021 and was not sure, it went away completely and was just at the injection site, probably lasting half a day or so and then it went away, clarified as left arm, same as injection. Caller added that 15Apr2021 was after the ER visit, was that she was standing up doing things and from her knee down felt tingly.

This nurse reported for self that the 37-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot: EJ1685, Expiration Date: Mar2021), via Intramuscular on left deltoid on 20Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included Multivitamins  and escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO). Nurse stated, &#34;I was wondering I got the Pfizer (Covid) Vaccine on 20th and I have been having increasingly shortness of breath for last few days and I am wondering if that&#39;s the typical side effect of that. It wasn&#39;t prescribed, it was something given out to all the healthcare providers. It was like the first dose. It was first dose. I got an Intramuscular shot in left shoulder. Because I wanted to not spread it (Covid). I am not sure if it is due to the product, I got &#34;6&#34; (not clarified) from another patient, that&#39;s why I am calling, I want to know if this is like the typical side effect of vaccination or should I go get tested. I haven&#39;t taken any treatment yet. It&#39;s gotten worse everyday its a little bit worse.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: Unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 19Dec2020 at 37-years-old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included intermittent asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Following vaccination, I had a headache for few days along with some  pain on injection arm. The headache continued and soon some fatigue and tiredness accompanied it for 7-10 days following vaccination.  Then ten days after, I had an increase in symtpoms that included heightened fatigue, loss of appetite, feeling &#34;cold&#34;/ &#34;hot&#34; (no fever), and abdominal pain with nausea and some diarrhea.    Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

And also had chest tightness, shortness of breath and fatigue. Went to ER  That all lasted for 10 days. Fatigue aspect got better; the heartrate slowly started getting a little better. Chest tightness and shortness of breath - even when heartrate went down a little, I was still experiencing those symptoms anyway. Off and on thing for 10 days. Last 10 days - have significant improvement. Due for 2nd dose tomorrow - dr has advised I hold off.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

She said she did to morphine. Her bp was 119/74 with a pulse of 94. She said her nose was starting to get itchy, her ears and scalp were itchy, and her eyes were blurry. She had red blotches all over her neck and chest. She said her throat was tight. She was able to swallow the water she requested. I gave her 50mg of benadryl.  She had no visible signs of being unable to breathe. I explained to her we could call 911. She reported she had no insurance. She said she was on her lunch break at the hospital and wanted to get back. She did walk back across the street unassisted. Clinical observer, followed her over just to verify she made it in the building. She ended up checking herself into the ER instead of returning to her shift.

                                                Shortly after the vaccination I stated experiencing the tingling and prickery sensation in my face, my HR was elevated and my throat felt like it was thinkening and getting swollen but I could still swallow and talk.  I was taken to the Urgent Care who sent me to the ER because I was having throat issues.  The urgent care had given me 2 benedryls  before going to the ER.   I sat there several hours in the ER but was never seen and went home because I had begun to feel a little better.  The next day I had to take benadryl in the morning and the afternoon because I still felt the sensation where my face felt a little stiff and shortly after the symptoms began to subside. I had a little body aches and sore throat but they were very minor.

                                                I had received the 1st dose of the vaccine on 12/22/2020. I tested positive for COVID 12/27/2020 and experienced mild symptoms such as mild fatigue and congestion. Thinking I had recovered from COVID I returned back to work as a RN on 1/9/2021.  I was told I could still get the 2nd dose of the vaccine if I still wanted to and that I should expect side effects of possible fevers, chills, fatigue and that they can last up to 3 days. I went ahead and got my 2nd dose on 1/13/2021. By the next day I had chills and extreme fatigue. I was expecting it and thought it would go away by the next two days. By day 4 I was feeling just as bad and actually felt worse than I did when first testing positive for COVID. On 1/17/2021 I experienced shortness of breath and palpitations while getting dressed. I went to ED and was sent home. On 1/19/2021 I experienced similar symptoms while driving home from DR appointment. Went to ER again and was sent home and was told it was all post covid symptoms.

This started about 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was taken to the back of an ambulance and treated with a shot (I believe it was Benadryl) and oxygen and then transported by ambulance to the local hospital. I was told to continue taking Benadryl and to see my regular doctor. On 02/08/2021 I went to my regular doctor and was put on a steroid (prednisone) and switched to 50mg of Zyrtec twice a day for itching on chest and throat and injection site as well as continued throat tightness.

                                                Within the first 15 minutes of receiving the first Pfizer dose, I felt dizzy. I was felt extremely fatigued and ended up having to go to bed at 6:00pm that day. Then days later, I began to feeling a shortness of breath that lasted about 1.5 week. I literally could not breath normally. My body would force me to yawn to get enough oxygen into my system.

                                                After my second dose of the vaccine I had typical flu-like symptoms (fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea) yet also developed acute and severe shortness of breath. My flu-like symptoms resolved within 48 hours yet my breathing difficulties continued and worsened. I was treated in the Emergency Department on 1/12, 1/19 and 1/20 (work up negative for covid, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac abnormalities). It feels as though I am having intractable diaphragm spasms that are forcing my exhales out at the end of my breath cycle. I have lost 10lbs and have been essentially incapacitated for 6 weeks. I have been evaluated by head and neck (no vocal cord dysfunction), speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties), pulmonology (no lung specific issues) and am awaiting a neurology consult.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, and included unspecified treatments in the emergency department described as lots of medications.  There was no COVID infection prior to vaccination, and the patient has been tested post the vaccination, with negative results as aforementioned.  The clinical outcome of typical flu-like symptoms (fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea) was recovered in Jan2021; the clinical outcome of acute and severe shortness of breath and lost 10lbs was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on event-vaccine chronological association, a causal relationship between events severe shortness of breath and typical flu-like symptoms and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. the event lost weight is attributed to an intercurrent medical condition and assessed unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE).

As soon as I got the shot I could feel a degranulation and tightening in my throat, but I did not need to use my epi-pen. I did use my inhaler. After about 15 minutes the allergic reaction subsided, and after 30 minutes I felt well enough to go home.

Quickly became short of breath, cough, nauseous and dizzy. I reported my symptoms to the RN in the observation room and took Benadryl. My HR was in the 130s at that time. I then used my EpiPen. They gave me 2 puffs of an albuterol inhaler and a 2nd EpiPen before taking me to the ER where IV allergic reaction protocol was initiated ( famotidine, iv fluids, solumedrol) and a 3rd EpiPen was given along with a duoneb and iv lorazepam. My symptoms improved after the 3rd EpiPen and seems to slowly resolve over the next 48 hours. &#34;  Per ED note Patient is a 37 y.o. female presenting to the ED with shortness of breath and throat tightness. Immediately after getting a COVID vaccine today, patient developed sudden onset of shortness of breath, voice hoarseness and throat tightness.

                                                1:45 driving home, started to notice weird feeling like I had an allergy shot. 2:30 I got home and breathing was aggravated. 2 puffs of inhaler, sat down and waited. Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

                                                About 30 minutes after my injection, I started to feel a tingly feeling in my throat, then felt like my throat was slightly tightening. I was driving and pulled over to monitor. It stayed the same for about 10 minutes, then started resolving. I never had any trouble breathing and I could sip water. When I returned home, my husband commented that I looked  ?flushed.?  I called my PCP who recommended to monitor myself, but that I was probably fine and no need for any treatment. I have not had any issues since and now am 24 hours post injection. There is no phone number to the site in which I received my vaccine. I have been trying to connect with someone who can advise on whether it is safe for me to receive my second dose. I would be so grateful for any advice on how to proceed as I really want to get the second shot, but also am concerned if there is a risk that I could have a severe allergic reaction upon receiving it. I have searched the agency website and see where a second dose is not recommended for anyone that has had a severe or non-severe allergic reaction to the first dose. What I had was not severe, but I am unclear if it was enough to preclude me from receiving a second dose. I would so appreciate any insight, guidance, or connection to someone who can advise on how to proceed. Thank you.

She reports allergy to hydrocodone and confirms skin rash as the reaction to that medication. Currently she denies any itching of the skin or swelling of the lips/face/eyes. She also denies dizziness, numbness, tingling, or nausea. Epinephrine dose prepped and ready should condition worsen or anaphylaxis develop. Upon observation and oral rehydration Pt?s condition remained unchanged with persistent cough and throat tightness. EMS was called and care was transferred to fire and rescue. Pt was transferred to the hospital.

                                                Started with lethargy and hot flashes, followed by extreme shortness of breath, difficulty speaking and holding up my head and keeping my eyes open. Then trembling. The local nurse at the vaccination sight reported high blood pressure, rapid pulse and seemingly extremely low blood sugar. I didn?t go to the ER because my supervisor agreed to take me home since we were volunteering at the sight prior to me receiving the vaccine. I had to keep eating every hour or so due to blood sugar seeming very low. Shortness of breath continued. Pulse rate still high as I could sleep with my head down due to racing pulse in my head. Later that night I had small bumps on my arms with no itch. Then I had extreme fatigue and muscle fatigue. I kept experiencing extreme episodes of hot flashes. I woke up in the middle of the night with a headache and uncomfortable hot flashes. I drank 100% juice and ate a few goldfish. I had mild nausea and food aversions. The next day the bumps were gone. I went to work but was sent home. I was told I should have gone to the ER but I don?t have insurance. Once home, I went through 5 hours of extreme chills unlike anything I have ever experienced. I had to cross my arms over my chest and stack on blankets to regulate. If I moved my arms for more than five minutes or pulled the blanket down, I began uncontrollably trembling. I still had trouble regulating my blood sugar on day two. It?s day three and no bumps and no chills. Less muscle fatigue as well. I am still pretty exhausted and tire easy when doing things. I did experience the common soreness in the muscle the vaccination was administered, but I figure that is normal.  I am hopeful that I am improving and out of the danger zone. I took Garden of Life Elderberry with added nutrients last night and today I took my normal detox probiotic. I have been pushing fluids and have broken my intermittent fasting to try and keep my blood sugar up. I feel like my system is finally regulating and now I just have lingering exhaustion from the events that took place.

Then my chest and back became itchy. At about 18 minutes after the shot I started having trouble breathing, my throat felt like it was closing and I had a terrible cough. Given two Epi shots about 10 minutes apart, ER gave me breathing treatments and other meds via an IV and shots (I don&#39;t know what, I was a little out of it).

In ER I received a a second epi shot about an hour after admission as tightness as starting again. Benadryl, prednisone and Pepcid was also given. I was admitted for observation for close to 28 hrs. Following morning I was given more prednisone and Benadryl. It?s been 3 weeks and I still have side effects with throat and tongue discomfort at night and when laying down. Awaiting results from follow up testing.

Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back. They&#39;re happening now as I write this

                                                I first got a bad headache and dizzy. They brought me back behind a curtain with an emergency person. I got very dizzy and nauseous after that. They had me lay down on a cot. About 30 minutes after I received the vaccine, they brought me out to my husband?s vehicle in a wheelchair. By that time, I was so dizzy that I could hardly stand by myself. I was told to call my primary care doctor. My husband called them while we were headed home. My tongue was swollen a little. We decided to go to my father in law?s home, since he is a doctor. By the time we got there, I was coughing. We were still on hold for a nurse at my primary care doctor?s office. I started getting hives on my chest and neck and wheezing around the same time. We left before seeing my father in law to go home and use my nebulizer. For the moment, I used my inhaler, which doesn?t work as well. Once we got to my driveway, a nurse from my PCP office said to go straight to the emergency room. I spent the night at the hospital that night and was treated for an allergic reaction, which resolved the issues. I continued medications at home after leaving the hospital the following day.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

                                                I received my second COVID-19 vaccine at 820 am on 1/9/2021. I was feeling well, no signs of illness prior to the injection. Around 6 pm I developed at headache, 7 pm developed fevers, chills, and a cough. The fevers, chills, headache, and cough were gone the next day by about 1 pm. The cough returned the following day and persisted getting worse each day leading to wheezing and shortness of breath.  I had a negative COVID-19 test and negative chest x-ray. The PCP has diagnosed me with bronchospasms possibly associated with the vaccine as the cough came on following the vaccine. I have no know asthma, but they are also going to rule out an underlying asthma that could have been triggered by the vaccine.  I have been taking oral prednisone and using steroid inhalers with significant improvement, but the symptoms have not completely resolved. I am still under the care of my PCP for ongoing management.

                                                The day after I had the shot, i started to itch on my left arm , around the area I had the shot,,and then it developed into a rash like situation on both arms...the itching was so intense and then i noticed tiny bumps  and black and blue spots along my right and left arm.  It then spread to my thighs and upper chest area. I also had tightness in my throat and i took some Benadryll over the weekend hoping it would go away but it didn&#39;t. It got worse. On Monday, it was swollen on both arms and looked more like hives, red itchy with tiny bumps. On Tuesday, I went to my PCP who indicated it may have been an allergic reaction from the vaccine. She gave me Medrol and that is what I have been taking. Today the itching is a little less intense ..

Wasn&#39;t any better and lost my taste and smell for 3 days. Went to the Clinic, was tested for Covid-19 and the flu both negative. Went back to the Clinic and had chest x-ray, diagnosed with right middle lobe pneumonia.  Sent home with doxycycline and zofran. Took the Medication as directed. Still feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and still winded and extremely tired after doing the slightest bit of house work, whether it would be sweeping the floor, doing dishes, or laundry. I get extremely after doing one activity. I still have not driven.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported experiencing throat swelling, face and lip tingling. Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I woke up the next morning with the most awful body aches. I started having zinging pains in my joints with my lower extremities joints much more intense. My head pain was a 10 and my neck was very stiff. My spine hurt. I was sneezing had two days with a low grade fever. Now my temp has been running low. I had chest pressure that made me feel winded. my glands under my jaw are still swollen and at night I get white ulcers in the back of my throat. Still fatigue. Starting my second course of steroids. They helped but was off one day and was sick again that evening. Vomiting, diarrhea.

                                                With the second dose my symptoms started late evening on 01/13/2021. I started feeling bad, but finished my shift. Felt drained, headache to start. By next morning (01/14) I had fever (101.5F) and the whose body aches, nausea, diarrhea, horrible horrible headache, like a migraine, severe congestion, runny nose and some days later I started having an earache on my right ear. I would like to mention I also had a vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor that started with the first dose and had not resolved by the time I received the second dose and this time the odor is much stronger, it is awful, I already made an appt with my GYN. The odor got much stronger about a week after the second dose. I kept self medicating at home with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, but the fever would return as soon as the dose was weaning off. The 101.5F fever lasted for about 9 days.  I also experienced shortness of breath from 01/14 until the 22nd and I never had to use my rescue inhaler before. I had to use it and had to even call for a second one. I am very athletic and active and never need it even after my runs and workout activities. I consulted with my PCP on the 19th and again she gave me a covid test. Negative. She diagnosed me with inner ear infection (right ear). Prescribed me Levaquin and in 2 days I was much better. On the 22nd I finally started seeing the symptoms subside and started feeling better.  Also, I wanted to tell that I had a gas pain episode that almost sent me to the ER. My chest, my left shoulder hurt really really bad. I called a friend who is a physician and he told me to take some gasex first and if that did not work to go to the ER. Fortunately it worked. But the pain was excruciating.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I turned bright red - my face and my forearms. Not a rash or raised rash. It was a deep red flushing. I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

Then, per patient: &#34;Almost 2 weeks to the day after getting my first shot, on Friday 2/26, I suddenly and unexpectedly went into Rapid Ventricular Response atrial fibrillation. I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.  I do not have a cardiac history.&#34;

I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

                                                10 MINUTES after the injection, I became very hot and flushed, with headache, palpitations, weakness, and shortness of breath. I sat down, my heart rate was 110 on my I watch. I was breathing heavy and feeling sweaty. The healthcare providers had me lie down on a stretcher and gave me oxygen with my feet elevated. After about 20 minutes, I felt better. Later that day, I came home and slept for 2 hours. The next day, (today) I came home early from work because I feel very tired and having difficulty concentrating. But the other symptoms have gone away.

                                                heart rate spiked; difficult to catch breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 39-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, depression, acid reflux, and COVID-19 (prior to vaccination). The patient has no known allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications, within two weeks prior to vaccination, included sertraline (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), omeprazole (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), liothyronine sodium (T3), and levothyroxine sodium (T4). The patient experienced heart rate spiked and difficult to catch breath on 20Dec2020. The events were reported as non-serious. The clinical course was reported as follows: In Dec2020, the heart rate spiked to 194 when running outside and it was difficult to catch breath, so the patient ran/walked the 3 mile route. The heart rate spiked to 183 during a strength training workout and to 148 during a low impact weight training, which is unusual for the patient (as reported). The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of heart rate spiked and difficult to catch breath was recovered in Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

That lasted through 1/8. On 1/7 I started having trouble with taking a deep breath. Chest would get very tight and hurt when I would take a big breath, bend forward, or lay back.  I went to express care and they could not rule out pericarditis. Told me to go to the Emergency Room for further work up to rule out spontaneous PE or pericarditis.

Went to the ER on the 12/21/20-12/22/20 due to increase headache, vomiting, diarrhea, dizzy, dry cough, weak/extremely fatigue. At the ER was given IV fluid, Zofran, Phenergan, tested for the Flu and Covid, also had blood work. All my blood work came back in normal ranges, FLU and Covid test were negative as well. Discharged from the ER with Phenergan, the next 3 days I had a migraine and had to be in a dark room with lights off, still very dizzy, tired, shortness of breath with movement, could not eat it made me nauseas. Called for follow up with PCP he then put me on steroids, for 7 days. 12/28 called PCP office again, was put on another round of steroid treatment with antibiotic. Was off work from 12/21/2020-01/02/21 due to the sickness post the vaccine

                                                Patient received 0.3 mL of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine into left deltoid at approximately 10 AM. Patient was observed for 15 minutes to ensure no immediate adverse effects from vaccination.  Patient later returned to vaccine clinic at 1:00 pm reporting hives on both the arms and chest, which shortly after progressed to swelling in the face.  Patient reported having no shortness of breath and was immediately given 50 mg of diphenhydramine to help reduce allergic reaction.  Due to severe swelling in the face, it was decided to call EMS and have patient transported to hospital to be observed and evaluated by medical provider.

                                                Metalic taste feeling of numbness in face with itching started within 25 min. I self medicated with 25mg of Benadryl 15 min before injection because I had the same reaction to the first injection. However it did not prevent the reaction as I hoped it would this time. 30 min post injection I took another 25mg of Benadryl. Once med started working symptoms went away.  At no time did I have difficulty breathing. By midnight I was woken by chills, body aches, and head ache (possibly secondary to the jaw clenching I woke up with too). I took tylenol which did not appear to help which is abnormal for me. Fever, chills, aches continued on throughout the night and through the day into the night. On tylenol fever was noted to be 100.6 Fahrenheit. I was finally able to sleep with tylenol and motrin by 10 pm on 18th for 8 hours. Next day temp was about 97.6 Fahrenheit with mild sweating throughout the day and aches had subsided. Today Jan. 19th all symptoms are gone.

                                                An hour and a half after the injection I started feeling itchy at the site of injection and all over upper body/neck.  I also started wheezing, had difficulty (not exptreme) breathing and was coughing .  I called a medical professional that I know who has assisted at COVID19 vaccine sites about next steps and was advised to take a benadryl, so I did.  About 45 minutes later felt fully recovered.

Those symptoms wore off exactly 25 hours after I had received my second vaccine. But the next day, my asthma got terrible. Over the course of the next week, I was on my steroid inhaler twice a day, and on my nebulizer 4-5 times a day just to breathe. After about 5 days of not getting better, my doctor prescribed me liquid steroids to put in my nebulizer so that they would just target my lungs and not impact the efficacy of the vaccine. Several days later, I was still not better. At that point, I was 12 days out from the second shot. He then ordered me oral steroids that I would taper. After about 3 days without any improvement, he told me to hold at 20 mg of oral prednisone in addition to my steroid inhaler and steroid nebulizer solution. I am now 21 days out from the second shot, and my asthma has not improved. My lungs have had severe inflammation for three weeks now.

Because of being exposed to my charge nurse I had to go get tested. By 9AM body aches, headache, cough, chills.  Fever went down on Thursday 100.8F, hot and cold sweats. I never felt like that before.  I also had some GI issues (diarrhea) and a little bit of shortness of breath, just by walking to the restroom I would be very fatigued and when I checked my oxygen it would drop to 88% just by walking from my bed to the bathroom (Wednesday and Thursday was the worst). I still have fatigue and my throat hurts a little bit, I have congestion again and I started feverish again this Tuesday and lots of cough. Low grade fever (99.9F). My employee health told me to not return due to my symptoms until they subside or go get checked. Coughing and sneezing restarted yesterday. I had returned to work on Monday but then by Tuesday symptoms started reappearing.

This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

                                                pleural effusion; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable health care professional (patient).  A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL 0142) in the hospital via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium trisilicate (TUMS) and ibuprofen (manufacturer unknown) which was given 8 hours before (as reported). The patient previously took morphine and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that she ended up on the ER on the day of the report diagnosed with a pleural effusion which was reported to have started on 14Jan2021 at 08:00 AM. The doctors are unsure whether it could be related to the vaccine, but she was only 39 years old and have never had something like this happen before. The patient was given azithromycin as treatment for the event. The patient had not recovered from the event.  The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.

Could also have been a result of change in environment or stress of vaccination clinic day.

                                                On third day after 2nd vaccine was given, urticaria  appeared throughout my body, along with tongue swelling, wheezing, flushing, and eye irritation. Because my daughter suffers from allergic reactions, I knew to immediately administer Benadryl. I also took an additional dose of Zyrtec and Pepcid, which helped temporarily and symptoms subsided when I called my primary care doctor. I had a virtual visit,  and she then prescribed Medrol.

                                                I have been sick since 2 hours after getting the 2nd vaccine dose on 2/4/2021. I have been to urgent care, primary care physician on multiple occasions, Emergency Room. Been on 4 rounds of antibiotics, steroid injection, Prednisone. ABX include Doxycycline, two rounds of Levaquin and then Clindamycin. 50mg daily Prednisone. Cough syrup. Tested negative for COVID-19 twice, Mono, strep and flu. I have not gotten better since this flu vaccine. Last week, throat felt like it was closed off. Now have thrush. Is this related to the vaccine?  I don&#39;t know, but it is very suspicious that I have been sick for a month straight after receiving my second dose.

                                                Approximately 2.5 hours after injection, a fiery pain started at the injection site, went up to the shoulder, and down the left side of my chest. This was accompanied by chest tightening and slight shortness of breath. The pain ended after about a minute while I was getting my phone to call an ambulance because it was so bad. I chose not to complete the call as the pain began to fade. The chest tightening and breathing issue resolved a couple minutes later. My arm was extremely painful the rest of the day (achy, not the fiery sensation). I have never had a reaction like this to any vaccine or medication.

                                                On March 3, 2021, a eligible vaccine recipient, patient, received her first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine at approximately 9:00am.  After a 15 minute observation period, patient was driving home at approximately 9:20am when she began to feel tingling and numbness in her mouth and tightening of the throat.  Patient returned to clinic and informed clinic staff she was having a reaction to the vaccine.  A cardiologist volunteering in the post-immunization observation met with the patient and evaluated her.  The cardiologist was informed by patient that she had a history of allergic reactions to vaccines and carries an EpiPen, but had not used it yet.  Patient&#39;s vitals were normal. She was given diphenhydramine for her symptoms, which did not improve.  The Emergency Department was consulted, who advised that patient should be transported to the ED and monitored for 4 hours.  The cardiologist transported patient to ED via wheelchair.  The following day, patient reported she was released from the ED after 4 hours of observation.  All of the symptoms had subsided at the time of release from the ED, and she was back to baseline on 3/4/21.    The patient was referred to an allergist for consultation and clearance prior to receiving a second dose of Pfizer vaccine. Also of note, upon review of the patient&#39;s vaccine consent form, she did not acknowledge that she had previous anaphylactic reactions to other vaccines, nor was this information relayed to the vaccinator who administered the vaccine.  Upon return to clinic, the patient reported she was 5-6 weeks pregnant.

                                                Had sore arm for first two days. On the third day started getting palpitations and racing heart. This came and went and woke me up in the middle of the night and early morning several times. Today is day 10 and I was prescribed a 24 hour holter monitor. In the last 3 days I&#39;ve had several episodes of facial nerve pain in my jaw and teeth, numbness in my face and also pins and needles in various parts of my body. Sore and painful spot to the touch under left ribs. Extreme palpitations and heart racing that make me feel like Im going to pass out, sudden pressure on the left side of my neck and ear heartbeat in my left ear during these episodes, trouble breathing , pain and tingling in upper left chest and coughing that goes away in about 30 minutes. Each episode ends with uncontrollable urge to sleep.  Almost feels like an intense food allergy reaction but it happens on a completely empty stomach. They seem to be getting progressively worse

Once i removed my mask  for better breathing, chest became tight and swallowing became extremely difficult. Breathing quickly became challenging. I flagged attendant about my symptoms then quickly rushed to the back patient room. I explained this reaction is similar to an asthma attack - and attempted to use my recuse inhaler.  I used my rescue inhaler about 6-8 times.  I was offered water and to sit down to focus on breathing. Breathing returned to normal after waiting the full 30mins. I immediately scheduled a follow-up with my PCP to discuss my experience.

                                                She reported a previous reaction to initial Pfizer dose: complained of left facial numbness/tingling as well as flushing, she also reported facial swelling. She was treated with Benadryl 25mg PO.  She was unable to make an appointment with allergy/immunology prior to obtaining this dose.  She received the dose and was given a 30-minute observation time.  While in observation, I spoke to patient and she reported right-sided facial numbness and tingling but no flushing or swelling. She was otherwise feeling fine.  Approx 10 minutes after injection, she complained of difficulty swallowing and mild throat swelling. Pulse was 110, O2 was 98% on room air.  She denied SOB, wheezing. No stridor was noted and oropharyngeal exam was normal, no swelling or erythema noted.  At this point, Benadryl liquid 50mg was given.  After another 15 minutes of direct observation, her swallowing had improved and she felt stable to go home. Her pulse was 82, O2 98%.  Suggested that they keep Benadryl at home, she can use every 6 hours as needed. If symptoms worsen, seek higher level of care. Patient and partner stated understanding.

Advised to go to emergency after been checked out by allergist on site. At emergency, was given Pepcid, steroids, IV fluids, Benadryl intravenously. Also, did bloodwork and chest X-ray. After bloodwork came back, doctor felt okay to release me. Over the week, still felt heavy chested and I could not return to work until a week later. The emergency doctor, sent me home with steroids, Pepcid, and Benadryl to take for the next 3 days. I only took the steroids and Pepcid because the Benadryl made me feel so out of it. I also started to get fatigued couple days after with some body aches. On Saturday morning,  I woke up at 4:00 am to vomit. Had an appointment with my PCP that Monday, told me to take Claritin and Albuetrol inhaler.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I began feeling short of breath after doing minor tasks in my own (doing laundry, walking up steps, etc.)  during the  2nd week after my covid vaccination. On the morning of April 10th I awoke to feeling severely winded as if I had run 18 marathons just to walk up 3 steps or to walk across a room.  I was taken to the ER where they performed a catscan on me and could see that my lungs were ?full? of blood clots and I was experiencing a pulmonary embolism.  I do not smoke, take birth control pills, I do not drink.  There is no family history of clotting, nor did any traumatic incident happen within the last two weeks to cause this.

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.
