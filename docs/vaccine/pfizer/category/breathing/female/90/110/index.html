                                                Chest pain; shortness of breath and difficulty breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 90-year-old female patient received their first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 11Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation from an unknown date (AFib, diagnosed around 10 years ago), pulmonary issues from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (pulmonary issues started within the last year), bad heart from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced chest pain, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she has a lot of the symptoms that she lives with daily, she has a bad heart, has A Fib, has a pulmonary doctor and she discussed this with her doctor and they told her to go ahead and get the vaccination, so she went ahead with the vaccine, about 3-4 days later, got these chest pains, she has not had any chest pains connected to her Afib before, she also had shortness of breath and difficulty breathing 3-4 days after the vaccination, when she sat down and waited for this to pass, when it did pass, does not know if it was 5 min or 10 minutes, when that went away she felt very good. The patient also reported that she has not had any more chest pains since the first episode, she is still struggling with the difficulty breathing but unsure if this is just her body and prior conditions or due to the vaccine. Does not know what it was, thought maybe she had a heart attack, wants to know if she should go ahead and get the second vaccine. Does not want to get any of the side effects worse than what she had, states someone told her the second one hits you harder and wants to know if this is true. The patient did not recover from shortness of breath and difficulty breathing while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch number/lot number  has been requested

On 17Jan2021, when she woke up, she was completely incoherent and would not eat. On 17Jan2021 she was taken to the emergency room (ER), and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and persistent urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was admitted on 17Jan2021 and she was treated. On 18Jan2021 patient got better, they put her on a bunch of antibiotics. On 19Jan2021 patient walked the halls, she wasn&#39;t incoherent. She was going to get PT/OT, speech therapy. The patient was discharged on 20Jan2021 and was taken to rehab type place (near the hospital), she was fine. However over the night she got worse. She became incoherent again and couldn&#39;t breathe without oxygen (21Jan2021). On 21Jan2021 the patient was sent back to ER due to trouble breathing. The reporter stated that something happened at nursing home and the patient went bonkers. She was admitted again (still ongoing) and put to intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac function test: nothing wrong with heart in Jan2021, chest x-ray: concerning for possible Covid pneumonia on 17Jan2021 (transvenous pacemaker is present some peripheral, increased entity present Concerning for possible COVID pneumonia), CT scan: no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax in Jan2021, COVID-19 virus test: negative in Jan2021 (2 times during the ER trips). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with unspecified antibiotics.

                                                Injection site became pink, 3X5 inches, the day following the shot.  On 2.11.2021, about 55 hours after vaccination #2, pt developed generalized weakness, nausea, and then vomited.  She was taken to bed, where she rested poorly and only dozed off for 1-2 minutes at a time and was mumbling words.  She  continued with generalized weakness, nausea with dry heaves, a sensation of marked shortness of breath, and inability to stand without support.  Complained of feeling hot and then cold.  Appeared pale and lethargic, skin clammy and complained of difficulty breathing and was irritable. Lung sounds -clear, no wheezing despite being unable to speak more than a few words at time. Vitals at 10:00pm:  HR 62, pulse weak, O2 sat 92% (normal for her), temp 101.7F (her normal temp is 95-96).  Given a Tylenol extra strength 500mg, 2.5 mg Prednisone, increased O2 nasal canula to 3-4 L/min, and cold compresses to reduce fever and discomfort.   Vitals at 10:15p:  HR 93, O2 sat 92%, BP 131/59. Discussed going to the ER, but decided to wait until the morning if not better. Symptoms continued until ~ 2am, when she was able to fall deep asleep for 4 hours.  Awoke and felt better, able to walk, but still a bit weak and short of breath.  By noon Feb 12 she felt mostly back to normal.

A 95-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021. The patient was reported to have possible side effects that was getting worse. The patient had &#34;chills, fever, nasal congestion, upper respiratory difficulty breathing, non-productive cough.&#34; On Monday evening, 29Mar2021, the patient was brought to the hospital but tests showed that &#34;everything looked good&#34; (chest x-ray etc.) Last night, the patient&#39;s temperature reached 104 F and was given paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she was &#34;breathing rapid,&#34; and that she &#34;coughs when she takes a breath.&#34; Reporter asked if patient can be given an antihistamine; or something to help with the upper respiratory concern (nose blockage, upper respiratory breathing). The patient had not been well. They spent Monday evening and all night and in the morning at the hospital. They did X-rays and lab work and everything else. The doctors couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with her and stated that it&#39;s got to be the vaccine. She was really in bad shape at this point. She can&#39;t be out of bed for 2 seconds without having to get back into bed. She was having a upper respiratory thing going on. She had a fever as high as 104.5 last night. The fever was last night and she got paracetamol (TYLENOL) for that and brought it down. It did respond. The patient stated she can&#39;t breathe through her nose and she has upper respiratory problems. The problem was when they went to the hospital, they didn&#39;t find signs of infections, all normal across the board. The patient doesn&#39;t fake it, she was a feisty elderly lady. She walks up the hill every day. She was independent. Normally, she can walk and walks very well without any assistance. The patient now can barely walk. She can barely walk to the toilet without holding on to anything. She was constantly complaining about chills. Reporter wanted to know what can they do and not do and what should the doctors be looking at. They kind of just threw up their hands as this was side effects of the vaccine, but the patient was alarming on Monday night and even more alarming right now. The patient was in bad shape. She wasn&#39;t feeling good on Saturday night, but not too bad on Friday night. Reporter asked her mom how she felt on Friday. Reporter told her mom to put in her hearing aids, that would probably help. Reporter further explained that patient had a sore arm around the injection site and that she might not have been feeling that great. On Saturday, she was not feeling well and started to have a fever, sinus infection and upper respiratory problems. The patient stated that she finally identified it. Reporter confirmed the fever, sinus infection, and upper respiratory problems started on 27Mar2021 towards the late afternoon she was  progressively getting worse. Fever, sinus infection, chills, upper respiratory problems all have worsened. The reporter stated that her mother&#39;s (patient&#39;s) arm pain got better on Sunday and was now gone. On Saturday, her arm hurt from her shoulder to her elbow, it did get worse. However, a the next day it was gone pretty much. Monday in the emergency room, they did labs for her kidney, liver and were looking for infection. They did not find anything came up normal on everything. Today, the reporter thinks patient was worse. She doesn&#39;t want to come out of bed at all. She was laying there like a lump, whining and crying which she has never done. She was probably going to take her to the hospital again and  they were not going to do anything again. She stated that something got to change, They haven&#39;t had that conversation about going to the hospital. She was going to go downhill if this continues, it had gone downhill at this point. Reporter confirmed that patient has recovered completely from the arm pain while outcome of remaining events was not recovered.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

Saturday  the 27 is when it started, she woke with all these symptoms, she needed assistance with everything  she normally does by herself ex: taking shower, getting dressed.  Everyday after she got 10% better and as of this notice she still isn?t back 100%.. She better than she was but suffering from the effects. She?s not going to get second shot because she says it will kill her. I want her to get it but if the 2nd shot is worse than first I can?t in good conscience let her get it.

At 12:00 pm, she complained of worsening fatigue and blurry vision.  At 3:40 pm, she complained of loss of appetite but denied fever and chills.  The niece was unable to reach her by phone after 4 pm, so she came over to the decedent?s residence at 6:15 pm to check on her.  The niece found her lying face up in bed ?gasping for air.?  She then became unresponsive and EMS was called.  The decedent was pronounced at 8:11 pm after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts.  Autopsy showed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with marked partially calcific coronary atherosclerosis; marked pulmonary edema; and pleural effusions.  The brain was saved for neuropathology given the history of blurry vision.
