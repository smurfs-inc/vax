A 16-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Apr2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EW0150) (age at vaccination: 16-year-old) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as no. No COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination, no Known allergies. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks).  Right after the patient was administered the vaccine, he started getting dizzy and felt nauseated, was sweating profusely and breathing heavy then he passed out. They were in the car so the nurse reclined his chair. He passed out and then woke up and then passed out (twice) -They gave him water and gum to chew and remained laying flat. After about 20 or so minutes he felt better and nurse checked his pulse and heart rate during the ordeal. The adverse events start date was reported as 11Apr2021 14:30. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old young man presenting with chest pain admitted for myopericarditis.   He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

He started experiencing symptoms on 5/6/2021 morning a t06:07 AM.  He received his second dose of  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 5/4/2021 10:: AM.  In the ED, CBC, CMP and UA was within normal limits. EKG at 20:46  and again at 21:14 showed  ST segment elevation in inferolateral leads with possible myocardial injury, ischemia or pericarditis.  Troponin 0 hour was 835 and at 2 hours 1674.  Patient was admitted to the PICU for further evaluation and management. Echo on 5/6/2021 showed normal LV systolic function with SF 31%  . Cardiac MRI on 5/7 showed contrast enhancement of inferolateral wall consistent with myo-pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.  Troponins were trended every 12 hours and plateaued in the 1800&#39;s on 5/8/2021. Patient was diagnosed with acute myo-pericarditis. Respiratory viral PCR and COVID-19 PCR on 05/06/2021 were negative. Thyroid studies were normal. ANA titer is pending. Viral serology for HbsAg was negative and HIV was non-reactive. Results for additional viral serologies for Coxsackie viruses, EBV, CMV and HHV6 are awaited. Patient was treated with  NSAIDs and Colchicine. IVIG was not given based on clinical judgement. Pediatric Cardiology was involved in patient&#39;s care and clinical decision making. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on room air throughout his PICU course. He was discharged on 5/9/2021 with Pediatric Cardiology outpatient follow up in 2-3 weeks. He will continue Ibuprofen 600 mg every hours and Famotidine 20 mg 2 times daily until his follow up.

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

The patient states that he felt dizzy/eyes were &#34;going black&#34; in and out. Heavier breathing than normal. States it feels harder to breath, but no reports of swelling or itching. Also states that ears were ringing. Pharmacist attempted to check blood pressure on patients left arm with an automatic cuff, but the machine errored twice. Then attempted to check BP with a manual cuff. Reading was varied due to patient moving his arm and hard to hear. Seemed to be around 90/50, but not precise. After 10 minutes, patient stated he was starting to feel better, just felt thirsty. Pharmacist rechecked BP on right arm with a different automatic cuff and reading was 104/62, with a pulse of 101. Patient continued to improve, stating that visual disturbances were gone and hearing had returned to normal. Was able to stand and walk around without feeling dizzy. No difficulty breathing reported at that time. Patient and mom waited another 5 minutes to ensure he had no symptoms and then were able to leave approximately 25 minutes post vaccine.

Sore throat has been present for about a week and fevers began on 5/17 with a Tmax of 103. On 5/18, she began developing shortness of breath and upon evaluation by the PCP on 5/19, she was admitted. During initial workup on 5/19 upon admission, hospitalist was high concerned as she developed hypotension of 91/48 on 5/20 at 08:35am. CT of chest on 5/20 showed patchy consolidation of the posterior lower lobes bilaterally. At that point, I was contacted and recommended broadening regimen to clindamycin , ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Upon transfer to Hospital, further serologies were collected which showed leukocytosis with left shift, highly elevated CRP, elevated troponin, elevated IL-6, elevated ferritin, negative Covid abs test, negative RVP, and negative Covid PCR. IVIG (2grams/kg) started on 5/20 at 22:57. Cardio and ID on board and all regular myocarditis infectious workup has been collected. ID consulted for workup and management.     Of note, patient received the Covid vaccine on 5/1/21

Sharp pain, severe, had to stop.  Pain resolved within a few seconds when he stopped.  Similar episode the day before but much more subtle mild achy pain.  Has had faster heartrate and out of breath much easier since he received the 2nd COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks ago.  Dull pain/pressure in his chest has been persistent the last few days since he started running for soccer, club soccer just started.

                                                myocarditis; chest pain; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took ceftriaxone and received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunisation.  On 08May2021, the patient experienced myocarditis, chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test (nasal swab): negative on 09May2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with ibuprofen. The patient outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory  role of  BNT162B2 to the reported myocarditis, chest pain and shortness of breath cannot  be totally excluded.  Additional information is needed to  better assess the report.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021565275 same reporter/AEs/vaccine, different patient.

He refused to take Tylenol that day, unlike his 14 year sister who had the same symptoms. On Sunday morning (the 3rd day) he woke up &amp; told us he was having chest pain &amp; shortness of breath. His sister was doing fine. So I gave him Tylenol at 10am to try to reduce any inflammation &amp; he still had a fever of 100. About an hour later his fever had reduced to 99 but he was still having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath ... mainly if he walked or moved around. He didn?t want to get it checked out but I called our insurance &amp; they agreed that he should go to the ER for testing so we went there at around 3pm. He had testing done including EKG, chest X-ray &amp; COVID-19 test which all came back negative &amp; other lab tests that also came back negative.  They gave him some meds &amp; about 2 1/2 hours later diagnosed him with pleurisy.  He still was having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath when we left at 5:30pm but throughout the evening was getting better. We gave him Motrin before bed &amp; another Motrin this morning before school, even though he said he was feeling better.

Pain did not radiate,  he did not have any shortness of breath but pain with deep expiration. EKG performed in the ED showed diffuse ST elevations, and because of this patient underwent left heart catheterization.  Left heart catheterization performed showed normal coronary arteries, left ventricle dysfunction with apical hypokinesis and an estimated ejection fraction of 50%, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 20-25 mmHg, and no evidence of aortic stenosis, insufficiency, dissection, aneurysm. . Initial troponin level elevated to 12.4, max troponin level of 31.3. Pediatric cardiology was consulted with recommendations to start ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. An echocardiogram was performed and showed mildly decreased longitudinal strain in the apex and inferior basal segments. Patient currently continued on ibuprofen 600 mg q6h, with improvement of troponin level.

                                                The day following the second Pfizer shot the patient developed a fever to 101.5 that improved with Tylenol and did not recur.  On that same day he felt tingling in the hands and feet and reported a floating sensation.  This too resolved with resolution of fever.  On the third day after the shot he developed chest pain, difficulty taking a deep breath.  He woke up the following morning with nausea which resolved but the chest pain and a feeling that it was hard to take a deep breath worsened.  The pain was significant enough that he went to the ER.  In the ER, he was found to have an ECG consistent with acute pericarditis and his troponin was elevated (2.75, upper limits of normal 0.03).  He was started on IV Toradol and admitted to the hospital.  His troponin kept climbing so he was also given IVIG (80 gm).  The following morning his Troponin started coming down and he no longer was reporting any symptoms.

He did not tell his parents so evaluation was delayed. Shortness of breath and chest pain self resolved. He presented ~2 months later with persistent palpitations and was found to have a new diagnosis of frequent ventricular ectopic beats. 2 months post vaccination his inflammatory markers and troponin were negative and his echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function. However, the clinical history suggests the possibility of post-vaccine myocarditis. I am not positive whether he received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but I believe it was Pfizer. I am also not 100% positive about the date of vaccination.

                                                Within 1-2 minutes my son passed out and started violently shaking/convulsing. His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

A little over 1 hour elapsed before patient developed hives and itching beginning at injection site (deltoid), spreading first to elbow of the same arm, then to knuckles, chest, neck, torso, and face. Some wheezing was heard by family members, but the patient displayed no other significant signs of respiratory distress. The patient lives where only accessible via boat or plane. Family called a triage line and spoke with a nurse who encouraged immediate Medivac due to location time and extensive transit times to the nearest medical facility; however, family opted to keep child at home. A physician instructed the parents to administer 50 mg of Benadryl every 6 hours, which the family did. Rash and discomfort lasted approximately 4-7 days before total resolution.

He received the COVID vaccine 5 days ago in the afternoon and initially had what he expected to be normal side effects from the vaccine that evening. Symptoms included body aches, runny nose and general malaise. However, over the last few days he has felt worse and developed more congestion, cough, and sweating. He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting. No diarrhea. No numbness/tingling. No redness/swelling at injection site. No rashes. No HA.

                                                Intense headaches the day after taking the shot, back pain from the waist up. 2 days later I woke up with chest pain and the lingering headache, my chest feels heavy and maybe shortness of breath. I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

Patient received his second dose and with in 48 hours was hospitalized for appendicitis.   If it was a reaction after just one shot, I would normally think it was a coincidence. With him have severe reactions after both shots, it seems very suspicious!

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

                                                Thursday started with sore throat, fever, chills, stuffy nose and headache. We gave him Acetaminophen. Fever continued into Friday with the same symptoms. Hives began Saturday morning and gradually got worse. We gave him Benadryl at that time and the fever went up to 102.5 F. Wheezing in his chest began. Sunday morning the hives were worse and we decided to go to the doctor. We went to a walk in clinic who after an EKG wanted us to go to the Emergency room due to a &#34;blip&#34; and a concern for myocarditis. At the ER they administered Prednisone and more Benadryl through an IV.  They decided to do a CT Scan to look for blood clots. (the ER doctor mentioned he was glad that we brought him into the ER...) No blood clots were found thankfully and they eventually released him, with a prescription for 4 days for  Prednisone, more Benadryl and Pepcid. The hives continue today, the day after, and are barely under control by the Benadryl.

                                                myocarditis; myocarditis; chest pain; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the second of two reports. A 17-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 17-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included myocarditis from 2019 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient admitted to hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath, diagnosed with myocarditis on 05May2021. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days. Treatment received for the adverse events include metoprolol, amiodarone, ketorolac, IVIG. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 05May2021. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events were considered as serious (hospitalization).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Myocarditis is not uncommon disease in young population.  This 17-year-old male patient had medical history of myocarditis from 2019.  Based on information available, the reported recurrence of myocarditis with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath was not considered as causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                On Monday, May 31, 2021 at 1:20am pt. woke up with intense chest pain and labored breathing.  He was able to fall back to sleep and woke up two hours later (3am) with the pain escalating.  He did fall back to sleep again and once again woke up at 9am only to learn the pain was even worse and was barely able to breathe.  He called me, his mother, and I raced him home and straight to our local Emergency Room.  The ER originally thought it was a collapsed lung.  After the x-ray came back negative for a pneumothorax, they continued testing.  The very last test they did showed extremely elevated Troponin numbers at 1.05 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) numbers at 5.42.  We were transferred by EMS/ambulance to the hospital 40 minutes away and checked into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Pt was admitted in the afternoon of May 31st and was released on June 3rd at 1:30pm.  June 1st his Troponin was 0.26 and CRP was 6.10.  June 2nd Troponin was .45 and CRP was 3.54.  The day he was released from the PICU (June 3rd ), his Troponin was .45, and the CRP was down to  1.83.  Pt received daily EKGs, 24-hour heart monitoring, constant blood pressure tests, as well as blood oxygen levels.  Once released from the hospital, Pt will be on light duty for at least a week, if not more.  First follow-up Cardiologist appointment was June 8th at 10:30am.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and blood work was ?normal.? Pt was put on a 72 hour heart monitor on June 8th and will be removed June 11th.  Will start weaning off Ibuprofen and acid reducer, Pantoprazole, the next three weeks.  Will continue to take Colchicine for three months, as well as light movement and exercise, nothing strenuous (swimming, running, etc.).  Follow-up with cardiologist in one month (beginning of July).

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

He and his mother went to the restroom where she helped him to the floor so he did not fall. He reports not remembering walking to the bathroom, and was woozy when I (the pharmacist) arrived to the restroom. His breathing was elevated, and he was pale in color. No emergency medication was administered . Paramedics arrived to check him out, and he left the store under his own power.   The vaccine-administering technician reported that he seemed very nervous to receive the vaccine today. When I was talking to him in the restroom he admitted that he has a history of anxiety/panic attacks when receiving vaccines in the past.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

I was constantly trying to swallow to make the sensation go away. The throat tightness lasted but became progressively better for about 4 hours, until about an hour after I took 50mg Benadryl, when it went away completely.

He reported he had swelling of his throat  when he eats shellfish and he does have an Epi Pen at home but he doesn&#39;t carry one with him. He said Benadryl usually also helped. I told him we had Benadryl if he wanted to take a dose and he did want to receive it before leaving. I confirmed with the patient that Benadryl did not make him drowsy and that after taking 25 mg, he said he would be fine to drive and doesn&#39;t get drowsy with that medication.

A 19-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25Mar2021 (received at the age of 19-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergies and cardiac murmur he had as an infant. When probing medical history, the consumer reported that as an infant, her son, had a heart murmur. Her son saw a heart specialist in (State) who did an ultrasound/sonogram of her son&#39;s heart. The specialist said the heart murmur was fine and nothing needed to be done. She also adds that for family medical history, she and her husband don&#39;t have any early onset heart issues in either side of their families. She also reported that her son has horrible seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; triamcinolone acetonide (NASACORT) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; montelukast (MONTELUKAST) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that her son (patient) had a heart attack (26Mar2021) after receiving the first dose of bnt162b2. The patient also experienced heart failure on 28Mar2021 and had fluid in his lungs on Mar2021. She called regarding the COVID-19 vaccine on behalf of her 19-year-old son who received his first vaccine on 25Mar2021. Her son received his first Covid 19 vaccine at a PRIVACY where he attends college. On Friday, 26Mar2021, he was feeling crummy, on Saturday, 27Mar2021, he was feeling crummy. On Saturday night, 27Mar2021, her son started texting her around 11:30PM saying he had pain in his left shoulder and left arm. He had already taken 2 Advil and it wasn&#39;t helping with the pain, her son asked if he could take a third Advil. The reporter told her son he could take a third Advil because it had been an hour and a half since he had taken the first two Advil. The texts from her son continued. He was getting no relief. He took a hot shower and tried self-massage and warm compresses. He ended up throwing up and he said he felt a little better. Her son tried to lay down and couldn&#39;t get any relief from his pain. The pain was tremendous in his left shoulder and arm. Her son told his mother, he thinks he needs to go to the emergency department. His mother is two hours away from him and told him to call 911. Her son had a friend take him to the emergency department instead of calling 911. Her son went to PRIVACY. While at the emergency department, the doctor thought that her son&#39;s pain was muscular. Her son received an injection of Toradol. Her son was discharged from the emergency room and went back out to his friend who had brought him to the hospital. Her son and his friend didn&#39;t even make it out of the emergency department parking lot when her son suddenly couldn&#39;t see anything. His eyes were wide open and all he could see was black. His ears started ringing. Her son went back into the emergency department. Her son received Benadryl and an Epi-pen thinking maybe he was allergic to the Toradol and having a reaction to the Toradol. Her son had blood work, an EKG, and vital signs done in the emergency department on 28Mar2021. His blood work were over 3000 which the reporter reports, indicates a heart attack. The emergency room doctor did not think the Toradol would have pushed his Troponin levels that high. With her son complaining to her about the pain in his left shoulder radiating into his left arm and throwing up, those are signs of a heart attack. Her son was maybe playing off the seriousness of the pain he was experiencing. It was agreed at that point it might be her son&#39;s heart. She was about 18 minutes away from the hospital when she received a call from the hospitalist, the doctor taking care of her son. And that doctor tells her that her son is not doing well and is not responding to treatment of the bag of saline fluids. The doctor is trying to get her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate back up. The doctor was afraid he might have to air flight him to the PRIVACY hospital. She told the doctor she is 18 minutes away and asked if he can wait that long or does she have to turn around and drive the opposite direction to the PRIVACY. At this point her son was having a COVID-19 viral test in case he needs to be transported to the other hospital. The doctor tells her that her son can wait the 18 minutes until she gets to the hospital. She arrived at the hospital and wanted to see her son, her son is on high flow oxygen and she has to gown and glove up to be in his room for fear of Covid particles since he&#39;s on the high flow oxygen. His COVID-19 viral test results have not come back at this time. Her son was admitted to the hospital for heart failure. He was in the hospital for 5 days. He was admitted in the wee hours of the morning on 28Mar2021. During the time he was in the hospital he had chest x-rays and he was given Lasix to get the fluid off his lungs. His white blood cells were way up so he was given an antibiotic. He had an MRI, Chest X-rays, and a Heart Catheterization through his wrist that would indicate that he had blocked arteries in his heart. He had no blocked arteries. The heart catheterization revealed an artery going into his 4th heart chamber was slow to open and close. The cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol for six months with monitoring. The cardiologist feels the Metoprolol will repair his artery and get his blood pressure and heart rate numbers where they need to be. He was admitted to the hospital at around 3:00AM on 28Mar2021 and was discharged on 01Apr2021. Her son&#39;s COVID-19 viral test came back negative, but his COVID-19 antibody test showed that he did have COVID-19 antibodies. The doctor didn&#39;t know if that meant that her son had a previously undiagnosed case of the COVID-19 virus or if he developed COVID-19 antibodies that soon after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. She reported when her son was discharged, he was feeling better, but still had residual fluid at the bottom of his lungs. Her son did have to go for a chest x-ray on Tuesday, 06Apr2021, after he was discharged, to make sure the fluid was making its way out of his body. When he was discharged from the hospital, he had some shortness of breath and he was tired and weak feeling. The pain in his left arm began before he was admitted to the hospital. The shortness of breath started during his hospital admission. At this point in time she would say her son has improved. The Metoprolol he was prescribed by the cardiologist is one half of a 25mg tablet once at nighttime. She stated that she does not have any information on how low her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate were during his time in the hospital. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Admitted to hospital overnight with an episode of palpitations around 6pm on the first night, being given motrin and colchicine throughout stay. Pain somewhat resolved and was discharged aprox. 100 hours after vaccination. Continued use of ibuprofen and colchicine in weeks following as pain slowly resolves.

I made the decision to turn around as I felt my throat was beginning to close. I got back to Medical Center around 2:35, where I was monitored until 4:15. I was giving Benadryl and water when I arrived and they took my vital signs. There was one RN monitoring me there entire time, keeping conversation with me, and checking my vitals every 15 minutes. Then around 4:15 a physician said I was okay to leave.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

                                                Approximately three to four minutes after the second dose, he reported feeling dizzy. A few seconds later he lost consciousness with eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was unresponsive to verbal communication or attempts to shake him awake. He then began grunting and struggling for breath. His body began to shake/convulse and he lost control of his bladder. This lasted about five to ten seconds. He regained consciousness and reported that he felt as if he was &#34;dreaming&#34;. He also reported feeling very hot, and had sweat dripping down his face. Paramedics were called to the scene where his vital signs were checked. All signs including temperature were normal. His first dose on /26/21 had an almost exact reaction, minus losing control of bladder, although that time nobody was around to assist him.

He was found to have markedly elevated troponins without EKG changes.  He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation and monitoring where cardiac MRI showed myocardial infllammation consistent with myocarditis. There was no other apparent cause based on patient&#39;s history.  He was found to have a reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram as a result of his myocarditis.  He continued to have dyspnea on exertion at discharge.

                                                21yoM states that on 25 March 2021, he noted 25 minutes after his 1st dose of Pfizer vaccines, he noted a throat tightness, feels tight, scratchy, noted a hoarse throat with some voice changes. He felt throat tightness made it hard to breath, he had associated lightheadedness, felt anxious, almost like a wheezing sound when breathed in and out in his upper neck. When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy. Since then, when he drinks apple juice, his throat will start hurting, but otherwise, he has avoided raw and cooked allergies. He does report seasonal rhinitis symptoms that are worse in the fall. He takes allegra as needed to treat these symptoms. He is not carrying an Epipen currently

He developed fever and myalgias on 5/13.  These had recovered by 5/14 - only complaint was sore arm and underarm swelling on the L.  By 5/15, pt had severe CP with dyspnea.  Taken to ED - noted to have elevated troponin and ST elevation on EKG.  Now s/p LHC today - coronaries clean.  Echo without wmas.  Cardiology suspects acute myocarditis.  No pericardial effusion to suggest pericarditis.

Patient says that he was in his USOH until yesterday when he started having substernal chest pain which was getting worse with inspiration but also with specific movements. He does have pain even at rest sometimes but he thinks that it&#39;s exacerbating by breathing. Had some nausea/vomiting as well. Denies other symptoms. Not really sob or leg swelling.    In the ER, his Trop I was 10.7 and his WBC was 12.2. His EKG was NSR with short PR and STE I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6  Patient is a 21 y.o. male with no past medical history who got his second dose of COVID (Pfizer) vaccine on Saturday presented with chest pain since Sunday with some pleuritic characteristics. He was found to have a very elevated trop I to 10.7, leukocytosis to 12.2 and STE in I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6. His POCUS in the ER was without significant pericardial effusion and probably normal EF. Differential at this point includes pericarditis vs myopericarditis (there are some myocarditis cases reported in Israel post Pfizer vaccination, predominantly in young male patients) vs less likely ACS. Will need admission and further work up and treatment        -Admission to Cardiology -NPO in case team tomorrow decides to proceed to LHC  -Full echo and cardiac MRI tomorrow  -Telemetry monitoring  -Repeat EKG q4h overnight  -send CRP, ESR -trend Trop to peak  -would not start heparin gtt at this point  -Please start tonight ASA 650 TID &#43; Colchicine 0.6 mg BID   21-year-old man admitted with signs and symptoms of acute myo-pericarditis or in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination.

He has no past medical history or exertional symptoms to suggest CAD.  Bedside echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.  He was admitted and placed on aspirin and colchicine.  A cardiac MRI today showed evidence of myopericarditis.  He had 3 beats of nonsustained VT on tele.

She reported that her girlfriend&#39;s husband lost hearing in one ear after he got the vaccine. She also reported that her son received the vaccine on 12May2021 and had lot of side effects which were very normal for 21 years old, but the third day he woke up and said he could barely breathe, he felt like something was involved with his heart and he couldn&#39;t even take the normal breath. She reported that they almost took him to the hospital, and he started to calm down by the end of the day, the events were gone but he had swelling around calves. The outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.

After 20 minutes he was able to go to sleep but then it woke him up in the middle of the night and but after a day it was pretty much gone. Reporter is wondering if he should receive the second vaccine which is due on the Friday 18Jun2021. Reporter has a friend who had the exact same thing happen after the moderna shot. She went to the urgent care and was given ibuprofen. She wanted to know if her son really needs that second shot, he does not want him to get the second dose, if her son was in the age group that is immune after the second dose or not. Reporter requested to speak to team studying myocardia because son&#39;s health care. reporter don&#39;t think he needs the second shot for immunity because of his age and his lung linings something being inflamed his organs that scares him about his heart. He got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine about 2 weeks ago. reporter want to say 5 foot 9 and he&#39;s probably 160 maybe a 160 pounds I think so yeah it&#39;s either 155 or 160 he is not sure. he was thinking of taking him to get an antibody test, just to find out that he can get the second shot. Patient received treatment of Advil for Had a real severe sharp pain about few inches below his clavicle, reporter think he just took one pill. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weigh was he&#39;s probably 160, weight was it&#39;s either 155 or 160 on an unspecified date, weight was maybe a 160 pounds lbs on.

Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

                                                Pt reported reaction with #1 dose of mild SOB and itchy throat. Given PO Benadryl and brought to ED for his SOB, though no additional treatments administered. Both ED Physician and PCP advised pt should still receive #2 dose. Pt presented prior to dose with normal mentation, and no difficulty ambulating or verbalizing beyond baseline. Pt had no issues when receiving vaccine then called over staff 2-3 minutes after vaccination to report SOB. EMS notified and staff. EMT and staff. EMR came to assist patient. Clinical Lead notified of 1st dose reaction and current reaction after SOB onset began and EMS brought over. Pt provided PO Benadryl 5 minutes after vaccine administered and able to swallow with no issue. I, Clinical Lead, remained at patient side where patient was able to describe his pain but had dyspnea and only able to get out 2-3 words at a time. After a few minutes, pt SOB worsened to the point he was unable to speak but no color changes noted. Mentation declined with pt somnolence present. At this point, Clinical Lead called 911 for backup as Benadryl had no relief of symptoms and SOB worsened along with mentation. Also noted that EMS pulse ox was not working so unable to provide accurate O2 saturation to delineate whether reaction was anxiety or allergic. Pt also noted history of seizure disorder though declined feeling was a current seizure and denied history of respiratory or cardiac conditions. Paramedics felt pt needed transport to the hospital and report provided by Clinical lead.

Thought these were both side effects so went to bed.

He has no mouth swelling, there has been no rash or hives at all. He has no hx of asthma and doesn&#39;t believe anxiety is playing a role.  Pt concerned he may have gotten COVID from the vaccine.

                                                Chest Pain, Myopericarditis; From EPIC: From cardiologist healthy man who comes to the ER with left anterior chest discomfort for the last 36 hours or so.  Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

                                                The side effects didn&#39;t all occur simultaneously. Friday evening I noticed severe arm soreness. Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I&#39;m a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I&#39;m so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening. Overall, with dizziness, body aches, extreme fatigue, etc., this was the sickest I&#39;ve been since I had a severe case of the Flu in high school. The fatigue, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate continued for about a week - getting slightly better each day.

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

As I type (3:30 pm, 21 hours and 45 minutes later), I feel back to normal again: perfectly fine.

Body fatigue, temperature varying from low 99 F up to 101.3 F. These symptoms subsided after about 2 days. Also developing during this time was an asthma attack, characterized by wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Patient has had life-long history of asthma, moderate, well-maintained with albuterol inhaler (life-long) and Qvar redihaler (beginning in early-mid 2020). However, after the common symptoms subsided, the asthma attack prolonged for over a week (2nd injection on 22 Apr 2021, and present as of reporting (03 May 2021). Albuterol inhaler would ease the wheezing, but no effect on mitigating the coughing / difficulty breathing. Qvar redihaler had no effect. Asthma attack would alternate in waves (approximately every hour up to 4-6 hour cycles), of breathing mostly clearly (some difficulty persisting), and severe attacks when extremely difficult to breathe.

                                                I got my shot on a Friday afternoon. The following Tuesday afternoon, I was out running sprints with a friend. After a couple, I felt super winded, like I was gonna pass out. This was concerning since I run at least 30 miles a week.   Early the next morning, I woke up with my heart racing and shortness of breath. This persisted for a couple of hours. I woke up with a stiff chest, pain and aches around my body, and struggling to breathe. I went to urgent care and they did an EKG on me that came out abnormal. They referred me to a cardiologist where I got an appointment the next day.   The cardiologist runs another ekg this time it?s worse. She sends me straight to the ER. They run a bunch of tests but nothing is conclusive. I?m released the next evening.   The following Monday I had a checkup with my cardiologist and she referred me to someone she knows at a HCF. My appointment is not until the end of June

About 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine, patient complained of dizziness and some shortness of breath.   I did not see any swelling or noticeable difficulty in breathing.   Patient also complained of numbness and tingling on this hands.  Patient was told to be very relaxed on the chair in order to recover.  Patient then complained of losing sensation on his hands.  Also, patient said that he was going to pass out at any time.  Girlfriend was present with patient.  I told patient that I can call 911 immediately if they like.  We called 911 and within 5 minutes EMT ARRIVED.  EMT arrived and ran some tests on patient.  They said that patient &#39;s respiration was getting back to normal capacity and confirmed that patient was having an anxiety attack.  EMT asked if he has been taking medication for his anxiety.  Patient said that he isn&#39;t on any medication for his anxiety.  Patient  was then taken to the ER.

                                                My first dose of the pfizer vaccine was relatively asymptomatic. Received at local hospital. Sore arm that lasted a few hours, nothing too concerning.  This adverse event describes my second dose however, received Jan 23, 2020, approximately 3 weeks after the first. Again, this was received at local hospital. The next day, I felt the expected side effects of terrible chills, whole-body myalgia, and a slight fever. Again, I was not too worried as this was expected. I could not sleep that night, but otherwise, I felt significantly better in the morning.   Unfortunately, on Jan 25, 2 days after the second dose, I began to feel a strange tingling sensation in my forearms, and a pain in my lower back. This paresthesia felt as if the insides of my arms were vibrating, and rather than a &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensation, I felt electric shocks through my forearms and extremely discomforting tingles. I could not bend forward without terrible shocks through my arms, and my back pain can only be described as aching. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday afternoon, That entire Sunday, it felt as if the tingling sensation, rated at 7/10 discomfort, grew to 10/10. I physically was wincing and turning, unable to find any position where my arms were not experiencing electric vibrations. My back pain, which was tender to touch, and if I pressed hard enough on it or laid on my back, caused the same electric sensation not just in the forearms but the entirety of my upper torso and my arm. Taking deep breaths was painful, as it elicited the same discomforting paresthesia. At the time, I was one of the first groups taking the pfizer shots, and it was still unclear if taking NSAIDs was a good idea to alleviate pains and the suppress the immune response. I agonized that entire Sunday and through Monday morning, the shocking expanding from just the forearms to the shoulders around the deltoid, and the back pain soon covered my entire upper torso. For whatever reason, waist-down I was completely fine. Even bending forward only elicited the pain upwards, nothing ever went down my legs. I had slight neck stiffness, a throbbing headache, intense back aches, bilateral upper extremity paresthesia, and pain on deep inspiration at the height of my pain on Monday morning. By this point, the pain had kept me awake for almost 30 hours.  When I finally could see my doctor via telehealth appointment, he prescribed me 800 mg ibuprofen to be taken every 6-8 hours I believe. After taking the ibuprofen, the pain lessened significantly, going from 10/10 to 2/10. I was finally able to go to sleep sitting up straight on a sofa chair. The paresthesia was gone, the pain on deep inspiration was gone, but the tenderness and dull ache in the lower back seemed to stay even on the ibuprofen. I noticed that if I laid down on my back to try and sleep, even with the medicine in full effect, the electric shooting and paresthesia would immediately return. If I quickly removed pressure from that area, it went away.  The ibuprofen&#39;s effect lasted only about 5 hours. I would take another as it slowly crawled back up to 4/10 pain or if the paresthesia was returning. Over the course of an entire week, I constantly needed to be on ibuprofen. By Friday, so almost 6 days after the shot, the paresthesia and back pain could be completely suppressed by the ibuprofen and I was able to lay on my back with no problems. Without medicine, I was sitting at a dull 3-10 back pain, but the paresthesia was gone. The back pain finally vanished on Sunday, 8 days after the shot, and I no longer needed ibuprofen. No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation of electrical pain down the leg, vision change, or loss of bowel/urinary control throughout the course of these symptoms.  My experience reported to my primary care doctor, via our health messages. I did not return any contact to hospital or my vaccination site.

                                                I am healthy 23 year old male. I have never suffered from any sort of illness or conditions. After massive push by the goverment and incentivization to take the New Covid-19 Vaccines deemed safe , I went ahead and received the Pfizer shot on 05/24/2021. A day after I felt headache and dizziness. This stopped on the third day. Later I would have episodes of blurred vision. That stopped. But what has really affected me and continues to affect me , is that a week after I have developed major difficulty breathing.  I never , ever not even once in my life have suffered from breathing problems. It all started on an afternoon a week after the shot randomly with really fast heart palpitations and after those palpitations stopped I was choking, I could not breathe at all. After this , I am having trouble breathing normally or getting enough air in along with tightness in the chest area. For instance, I struggle with two breaths and then the third I will likely get more air in. I have felt incredible tightness in my chest. There has been nights where I cannot sleep because I am unable to breathe , and feel like I am choking. So , I need to get up and walk around the house to catch my breath.  I am having shortness of breath  and my breathing is not like it used to be. I do not have any fever or any other symptoms , the persisting problem is the tightness and difficulty breathing. I already went to the Pulmonary doctor a couple days ago and underwent testing that are pending.  I do not understand why this happened to me , I am not sure if it is a coincidence or if there is a relation between  me having taken that Pfizer shot . But prior to taking that vaccine I never  once had trouble with  my breathing  and never felt tightness around my chest. This is new to me and it scares me to think this might stay with me forever, whatever it is. I pray it goes away. I am still having trouble . and the fact that in the past I never thought about my breathing because it was normal, and now it is a constant issue throughout  the day,  moments when I can get air and others when it is very difficult. I  am reporting this  to leave a record of this incident because prior to me taking this vaccine , I was in fact a fully healthy person free of any sort of health issues.

Highest temp 102, took tylenol every 4 hours to help with fever and aches. At 9:30 pm began with continuous strong chest pain/shortness of breath. Nothing made it feel better. 9:45 PM Called after hour line of primary physician, who recommended going to ER. Left for ER at 10 PM. Chest pain had eased somewhat on the way to ER. Was seen at ER. Received EKG, lab work, CT scan, IV fluids and toradol. Chest pain was mild in ER and felt better by discharge around 3:30 AM.  Felt normal by 4/19/21 and returned to work. Have seen a few reports in news about myocarditis/pericarditis in males which seem to fit patients experience, so wanted to report the incident.

Went to urgent care evening of 2nd day, received 50mg diphenhydramine that suppressed itching enough to sleep. Woke up itching and red at 6am of 3rd day, took 25mg diphenhydramine. Took 40mg prednisone at 8am. Went to urgent care at 10am for worsening hives, spreading and covering torso and onto face. Received dexamethasone injection into glute and prednisone prescription was upped to 50mg daily for the next week.  Took OTC Zyrtec and Pepcid once following the second urgent care visit. Hives responded well after 2hrs post visit, assuming due to prednisone and dexamethasone. Day 4 (1/12/20) woke up with widespread hives that became further inflamed until an hour after prednisone taken with breakfast. Also woke up with slight sore throat and wheezing, both of which subsided. Currently scheduled to see an allergist on 1/13/20. No known allergies and no other known introduction of allergens in the past week.

                                                Woke up approximately 14 hours after receiving dose #2 with body fatigue. My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

He advised within &lt;15 minutes following the vaccine he sensed the left side of his neck was swelling.  He notified Immunization staff who brought him to the ER via w/c. He stated the ERMD did not perceive/palpate any swelling or nodules, and treated him with IV Benadryl with resolution of s/s.  He did not require any other doses of benadryl.    He received his 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine on 3/30/2021 lot#ER8734 to right deltoid.  He stated within 15 min again, he had the sensation of throat stiffness (as if muscles really tight/tensed) and this made it difficult to breath and caused his chest to hurt. He was taken to the ER again and given Benadryl again with resolution of symptoms. He was released later without any reoccurrence of symptoms. He states he went to work on 3/31 where he began to feel bad/achy-feverish.  Today he had a fever (not taken), total body aches but mostly to his left hand.  He reports feeling fatigue and unable to do normal AM routine of working out.  He could only stretch today.  He denies any trauma, recent illness, difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, ha, n/v/d, or other symptoms.

                                                DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray that was normal. 2. CT angiography of the chest showing no abnormalities. 3. Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient&#39;s troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4. Zofran 4 mg sublingual q.8 hours p.r.n. for nausea.  DIET: Regular.  ACTIVITY: As tolerated.  FOLLOWUP: With Cardiology on May 3rd.  If worsened pain, shortness of breath, or high fever, return for evaluation sooner.  In which case, steroids may be administered.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  I experienced extreme chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, painful heart beats, I could feel each beat. I hunched over in my bed groom grabbing my abdomen and fell onto my bed and almost passed out from whack I?d assume is lack of oxygen. I could barely breathe for about five minutes and felt relatively severe pain particularly in the right side of my chest. I could feel every muscle, tendon, and artery inflamed, enlarged, and hurting. My chest felt like it filled up with a balloon. Heart rate went up too. I have NEVER EVER felt ANYTHING like this in my LIFE. Not even close. It was a brand new sensation to me first time I?ve ever felt anything like this at all, and very intense and frustrating. Keeping in mind I am in perfect health. I am a body builder with a perfect physique. I work at a high end restaurant and have an extremely good diet. I have a normal sleep and sexual routine, I don?t use any medications whatsoever even Tylenol or ibuprofen. I have no pre existing conditions. I have no history of heart or cardio problems. My family has a history of low blood pressure. I have next to no stress or anxiety in my life. I am 24 years old I work out and run miles, five to six days a week. I don?t use nicotine, tobacco, and I haven?t had a drink of alcohol in ten years (14yrs old). I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. After about ten minutes the incident went down and I was able to breathe a little better but still had pain and tightness in my chest. I have had shortness of breath ever since. This is being written the day after the event about 26 hours later. I ran a mile last night and went to the gym it seemed to help both my breathing and the pain and tightness but it has not fully gone away. I feel my heart straining somehow as I am typing this. One thing to note is I did not want to get vaccinated but was pressured to do so, and before getting it I was very nervous and honestly upset. The woman administering it was not helpful at all and actually mocked my unsureness and was very rude and unprofessional. She didn?t answer any technical questions I had. During my interaction with her between my nerves and her behavior I?m absolutely certain my heart rate was elevated at the time of getting the shot. I have only had one shot. The episode of  myocarditis occurred two weeks after my first shot. Two days after my scheduled second shot, which I missed because of work and was going to reschedule before this occurred. I am not going to be getting the second shot. Will be following up with my primary care doctor as soon as possible. Haven?t had time.

EMS was called, patient denied care. HIS BP WAS 104/73 AT 12:53 PM AND HIS hr WAS 72 BPM. I did notice some mild seizure like physical symptoms  as he woke up - arms and shoulders jerked a little for a few seconds. he said that the same, but worse, reaction happened after his first dose.

                                                Severe apneic episodes with sleep. I have no history of sleep apnea, BMI of 24, exercise regularly, no known snoring. The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.

After two hours, the patient was experiencing some lightheadedness as well, and requested assistance from a local urgent care clinic, where it was advised the patient should come in and be checked out. At 7:30 pm, the patient&#39;s vitals were tested and all appeared in the standard range. The patient was administered some Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron, all orally. An Epipen was prescribed in case of a flare-up over the next 24 hours, however after an overnight rest the symptoms have disappeared.

He was seen in ER 29 APR (day 8) and diagnosis was URI vs. vaccine reaction. He states these symptoms have resolved.  He reports 2 weeks ago (day 7) he was then in the field training  and exposed to poison ivy. On day 14 he  developed  dermatitis to arms, abdomen and groin. He self treated with topical benadryl cream, which made symptoms much worse and produced a large plaque. He switched to calamine,  and witch hazel. On day 17 he developed a targetoid erythematous dermatitis to his hands and arms. He was seen in ER and diagnosed with EM and contact dermatitis and treated with oral prednisone, and cetrizine and Bactroban for sites of secondary infection. He reports lesions to hands and arms are mostly resolved, and abdominal plaque is much improved. He is using cetrizine and pruritis is not significant.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset of fevers and malaise on 5/7/21 (26 days after his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine).  His symptoms progressed to involve shortness of breath which prompted his admission to our Hospital on 5/12/21.  He rapidly deteriorated requiring intubation and ultimately placement on ECMO and temporary internal heart pump (Impella device) placement.  He was thought to have myocarditis due to elevated troponins at the time of admission and cardiac MRI showing wide spread myocardial inflammation suggestive of myocarditis.   He was treated with high dose steroids and supportive care due to the concern for cytokine storm and eventually started to show signs of improvement.   He was eventually taken off ECMO, internal heart pump and ventilatory support and went home after 20 days in the hospital.  However, follow up cardiac MRI revealed ongoing myocarditis, but his ejection fraction had improved.

A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No. EWO187) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19May2021 at 12:00 or 13:00. Relevant history included Diabetes, obesity, endocrine abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, respiratory illness, compromised immune status and Allergies. The patient had Allergies to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can induce anaphylactic shock, severe reaction, swelling of face and throat. Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines were Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable. No Vaccines were Administered prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History was none. About 3-5 minutes after being administered the Vaccine, the patient immediately developed anaphylactic shock. He was transported via ambulance to the Emergency Room on 19May2021 where he verified he was admitted to the hospital Emergency room for about 5-6 hours and discharged from the hospital the same day, 19May2021. He was told not to get any additional doses.  He was still having swelling of the throat and went back to the ER today and was given a steroid prednisone 40mg a day for 5 days.  He was advised to take benadryl also.  He said he didn&#39;t get any IVs or anything.  He had a past medical history of anaphylactic reaction to NSAIDS.  He has been advised not to get the second dose. The patient stated the anaphylactic shock occurred with trouble breathing, throat was swelling and itchy throat. He did go into ER, they told him to just keep drinking fluids, that there was nothing else they could really do. When he was seen in the emergency room they gave him Benadryl and a steroid: Prednisone for now which he is on for the next couple of days. He was told that after 2 days or something, that after getting injected that he wouldn&#39;t have any symptoms-but he is still having those pretty severe symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Initial onset of anaphylactic shock was about 3-5 minutes after Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot was administered. Within 10-15 minutes he had swelling of tongue and throat and difficulty breathing. They called an ambulance, the ambulance took him to the Hospital emergency room where he was admitted and discharged that same date on 19May2021 after about 5-6 hours; he reported discharge time was around 16:40. They told him to come back if he had any issues that occurred over next couple of days or worsening or causing problems; to call back the nurses line. He was on a lot of Benadryl, a lot of antihistamines. When he gets off the antihistamines almost all the allergic reactions of the anaphylactic shock reoccur. This morning, 21May2021, he didn&#39;t take any Bendaryl before bed, and this morning when he woke up he was alright. After being at work like 30 minutes he felt the itchiness; scratchy throat; swelling of tongue; a little swelling of the throat; difficulty breathing. He took Benadryl and called the hotline who told him to call the Emergency room, he called the emergency room and went there. He talked to them this morning because he went to work and had issues breathing. He called and they told him to come in asap, so he went in to the emergency room; they gave him Benadryl and told him there was nothing else they could do other than him taking the steroid: Prednisone. The patient was in the hospital 3 days and will be day 4 tomorrow. He was trying to figure out how long this will last. They told him to talk to his doctor. They basically told him they were not responsible. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her son received the shot Wed 19May2021. Does not know if the Walgreen&#39;s reported this. He left there in an ambulance within 10 minutes of getting the shot. They took him to the emergency room and he got mixed information. He went back again today. They blew him off and told him maybe it was something he ate. She assumed that an allergic reaction would be about 24 hours but this is day 3. She is scared he may be taking too much Benadryl. He said he felt like he needed something to drink. Said that his throat felt really thirsty. He went back inside since his throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up. They saw that his throat was swollen and they called the paramedics. Within 15 minutes they came and brought him to the emergency room.  Nobody had given him Epi. They were going to give it to him an Epi pen  but he wanted to wait for the paramedics. He was freaking out. The paramedics showed up and they were unable to give him Epi, stating he didn&#39;t have hives. He only received Benadryl. They he had to have to give him extra Benadryl because whatever they gave him in the IV because the first didn&#39;t work and his throat was still closing up. It made him feel like a drug addict asking for Benadryl.  She was not sure if they gave him Benadryl in the ambulance, knows that it was given in the emergency room. The Benadryl may have been started in the ambulance but she is not sure. They did give him oxygen in the ambulance. Clarified he was in the ER over 4 hours, but was not admitted to the hospital. They gave him steroids but forgot to send him home with steroids. He had to call to find out about getting them and they told him they forgot to send the prescription in. He was late starting the next dose of steroids. He went back to the ER today, day 3. He didn&#39;t feel too bad today and went to work. After exerting a little energy and moving around, his throat started to do it again. He didn&#39;t have Benadryl on him. He left work because he thought it was going to close up again the day he got the shot. Once he calmed down, he took Benadryl. He called the hospital to ask if this was  normal. He was told that it is not normal and was told that if he still felt bad, to come to the hospital. They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses. He spoke to one of the doctors. They had never shown him how to use an ePi pen. He does not know how long this will last. He gets scared. Treatment: Has only been taking Benadryl. He started the steroids yesterday and today. They had given him Benadryl today in the ER and he is home now. The patient visited to the Emergency room twice, first time by ambulance, confirmed he was not admitted. He was pretty devastated. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Immediate reaction of arms tingling and nausea/vomiting.  Basic vaccine symptoms the first week including headache, nausea, fever.  After about a week, COVID fog/fatigue symptoms began.  It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.
