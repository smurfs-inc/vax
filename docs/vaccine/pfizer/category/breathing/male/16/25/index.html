Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

I was constantly trying to swallow to make the sensation go away. The throat tightness lasted but became progressively better for about 4 hours, until about an hour after I took 50mg Benadryl, when it went away completely.

Average temp throughout the night and first part of the next day was 104.7, also experienced severe  headache, chills, and muscle aches and pains. Throughout the day after the injection 4-10-2021 these symptoms improved but did not completely resolve. Overnight from the 10th into the morning of the 11th I developed a cough and felt short of breath. The afternoon of the 11th my oxygen saturation began to drop upon light exertion (walking around inside my home). I checked in to the Emergency Dept. at around 7 p.m. on the 11th of April 2021. I had elevated D-dimer, and abnormal Troponin. I was admitted with a diagnosis of myocarditis.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                First day: severe chills (extreme body shaking), and body temperature alternating between overheating and moderate/severe chills every several hours. Body fatigue, temperature varying from low 99 F up to 101.3 F. These symptoms subsided after about 2 days. Also developing during this time was an asthma attack, characterized by wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Patient has had life-long history of asthma, moderate, well-maintained with albuterol inhaler (life-long) and Qvar redihaler (beginning in early-mid 2020). However, after the common symptoms subsided, the asthma attack prolonged for over a week (2nd injection on 22 Apr 2021, and present as of reporting (03 May 2021). Albuterol inhaler would ease the wheezing, but no effect on mitigating the coughing / difficulty breathing. Qvar redihaler had no effect. Asthma attack would alternate in waves (approximately every hour up to 4-6 hour cycles), of breathing mostly clearly (some difficulty persisting), and severe attacks when extremely difficult to breathe.

Went to urgent care evening of 2nd day, received 50mg diphenhydramine that suppressed itching enough to sleep. Woke up itching and red at 6am of 3rd day, took 25mg diphenhydramine. Took 40mg prednisone at 8am. Went to urgent care at 10am for worsening hives, spreading and covering torso and onto face. Received dexamethasone injection into glute and prednisone prescription was upped to 50mg daily for the next week.  Took OTC Zyrtec and Pepcid once following the second urgent care visit. Hives responded well after 2hrs post visit, assuming due to prednisone and dexamethasone. Day 4 (1/12/20) woke up with widespread hives that became further inflamed until an hour after prednisone taken with breakfast. Also woke up with slight sore throat and wheezing, both of which subsided. Currently scheduled to see an allergist on 1/13/20. No known allergies and no other known introduction of allergens in the past week.

My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

                                                Severe apneic episodes with sleep. I have no history of sleep apnea, BMI of 24, exercise regularly, no known snoring. The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.
