Lasted about 45 minutes.  took Advil and used the CPAC to calm my breathing down.  Then slept until 9:00 am.  But after I woke, I felt tired the rest of the day.  I am doing fine now.  I am not sure if this was a side effect of the covid vaccine or not. But I thought I let you know.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration at the left deltoid on 26Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 26Jan2021. When he came home that day his left arm swelled up and had a knot at the injection site. States he went right out, clarifies he went to sleep for hours. The next day (27Jan2021) when he woke up, he rubbed the area and it was sore. Three days ago (30Jan2021), he started running out of breath, he would walk to the mailbox and have to stop since he was out of breath. He never had that happen before. He was not sure what it was or if something else going on. He would have no breath whatsoever if he gets up to walk. When he was sitting still he was ok. If he gets up to walk to the bathroom, he was out of breath by the time he gets to the bathroom. States he was not short of breath as long as he was not doing anything. States it was crazy though when he starts walking and he gets out of breath. This has never happened to him before. He does not know if it was the vaccine or something else. He saw the shortness of breath was one of the side effects. He wants to find out what he should do and if he should go to the hospital. Advised to contact hcp. He asks if he was supposed to go back for the second shot. He has an appointment with his doctor in the next two weeks for all the medications he takes. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I had my second Covid-19 vaccine last Friday at noon, January 29, 2021. I felt fine until late Friday evening.  I woke up around 3am violently panting and trying to get his breath.  After what could have been a minute or many minutes, I started breathing normally.  My Friday night sleep was terrible.  I woke with a temperature around 101.  After taking Acetaminophen, my temperature went back to normal. Towards evening my temperature went up to about 101 and I was achy all day.  Saturday evening was a good evening and I woke up feeling fine on Sunday.

He went to the hospital with his wife on 3/1/2021.  He stated &#34;I think I&#39;m going to die&#34;.  Patient had been off Cymbalta  for 3 days completely- treating neuropathy (previous daily medication that his primary physician advised him with weaning down the dose).  The patient was manic and had tangential thoughts- from crying/angry to laughter.  It is believed that the agitation could be due to medication withdraw.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

One week after onset of symptoms he presented to the hospital and was diagnosed with submassive pulmonary embolism. He underwent IR suction thrombectomy which removed 30% of the PE burden and spent two days in the ICU. He has now been transferred to the floor.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

                                                The patient is a 77-year-old male with T2DM (not on medications), gout, and HTN who received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/14. On 2/17 (three days after vaccination), he sought care in the emergency department for chest pain that worsened when he was supine and shortness of breath.   EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.      Medications at home: statin, previously colchine for gout, likely BP medication (PCP will send records)  Allergies: None known.  Vaccine Indication: Age &gt;75

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

(His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

                                                difficulty breathing; pneumonia; human immunodeficiency virus; pain in arm, neck and back; pain in arm, neck and back; pain in arm, neck and back; FACILITATED COLLECT   This is a solicited report based on the information received by Pfizer from AbbVie Inc. (MFR Control No. # 21K-163-3841481-00). A non-contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself that a 78-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Batch/Lot number was not reported), intramuscular on 12Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA, Batch/Lot number was not reported, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen), subcutaneous from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, at unknown dose for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced difficulty breathing on an unspecified date, pneumonia in Mar2021, pain in arm, neck and back in Mar2021, human immunodeficiency virus on an unspecified date. The events difficulty breathing and pneumonia were reported as serious per hospitalization, event human immunodeficiency virus was serious per medically significant. The patient took covid-19 vaccine and afterwards had pain in arm, neck and back and could not breathe. He went to emergency room and was hospitalized due to difficulty breathing and was diagnosed with pneumonia. He did not know if this was due to vaccine and would not be taking second vaccine shot per his primary physician. He also had human immunodeficiency virus. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. On 12Mar2021, patient received first dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of events for difficulty breathing was unknown, for other events was resolving. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of Pneumonia, Pain in arm, Human Immunodeficiency virus, Pain in Back and Pain in neck with adalimumab was no reasonable possibility. Causality for all events with COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of all events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known disease pathophysiology, the  reported event of  Human Immunodeficiency virus , pneumonia  and dyspnea is assessed as not related to suspected product  bnt162b2 vaccine and  the events pneumonia  and dyspnea are more likely due to underlying medical condition of chronic plaque psoriasis. However the reported events of  Pain in extremities ,Pain in Back and Pain in neck is assessed as related due to close temporal association with the suspect product. However, more information is required on date of HIV infection deducted to properly assess the case. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient had some mild clinical decline the past few days prior to 2nd vaccination, with a decreased appetite and some increased fatigue per nursing report, but no significant changes. He experienced nausea on the evening of 1/6/21, which was effectively managed, but by early morning he spiked a fever of 102.9 with a sat of 86.1%. He continued to deteriorate from that point on and died 1/7/21 @13:20. Clinically, the presentation was most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.

I have asbestosis so shortness of breath is always an issue.  The pain is not.  I am assuming it will pass in the next 24 hours or so.

He notes that he received a 2nd 5 0 COVID-19 vaccination on March 6th and since then has not felt well, feeling short of breath and generally fatigued.  He notes that he has not been very active since receiving the vaccine.   CT PE study showed an increased RV to LV ratio 1.2.  He had no elevation in his troponin or BNP.  His echocardiogram showed an EF of 60% and there were no wall motion abnormalities and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient would prefer Eliquis at this time.  He will need a 6 month course of Eliquis.  Given the setting of recent COVID vaccination and recent decreased mobility as possible provoking factors, this will be treated as a provoked pulmonary embolus.  Per hospital COVID vaccine protocol, patient presentation will be reported to pharmacy for FDA reporting.

He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms. The events hasn&#39;t gone away, it&#39;s now about 3.5 weeks and he hasn&#39;t had a good day since then he has been experiencing chills and fever. It goes away for a couple hours, it goes away till around 9 or 10PM at night, then he is good at night, then in the afternoons around 2PM or so the fever kind of comes back and instead of chills he is getting warm flush, when taking his temperature he notices it ticks up. He is taking Tylenol every 6 hours. He would like to know if this is normal and have others reports this? The First time he experienced the chills and fatigue it was on 18Feb2021. Then the second time the chills, fever, fatigue, and nausea started on 15Mar2021. The events were described, &#34;Fever: It is not as steady, when it ticks up, it is never going past 100F, it&#39;s been like 98 and 99, that&#39;s when he starts to feeling so  bad. He provides todays temperatures, this morning 97.5F he usually runs low, then about 10AM 97.7, then at 11AM 98F, then an hour ago it was 98.8F and he can  feel the difference. Nausea: It occurs when the temperature ticks up, it&#39;s not really nausea but its uneasiness in the stomach, not necessarily nausea but he feels no appetite. It has the Same pattern as the fever. Fatigue: Yesterday morning he got a blood test and he did not have a fever he was normal 97F, but he could barely take 10 steps, the fatigue varies, it does not coincide with the fever. Looking back over the 3 weeks, the fatigue is better now. On 21Mar2021 he went to the ER because he was feeling so bad, there was a little bit of wheezing and shortness of breath, they did lab work and a chest X-ray, they sent him home with an antibiotic and a steroid inhaler. The chest X-ray showed Bronchitis. Blood work results are Unknown. He clarifies that the ER sent him home the same day after 9 hours, he was not admitted to the hospital. When queried if he had a physician office visits he states that he had 2 &#34;Tele-med&#34; appointments with the Primary Care doctor. He has no Allergies.

                                                history of hypertension, mild cognitive impairment.  Prior COVID pneumonia treated as an outpatient November 2020.  Completed dose 2 of Pfizer  vaccine  4/11 with progressive fatigue low-grade fevers and white count of 14 CRP elevated at 4 (see this would equate to a CRP of 40 with most other lab references) on 04/27.  He was admitted and treated for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  He was discharged 04/30 and then presented again 5/5 with progressive right greater than left consolidative ground-glass opacities and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring up to FiO2 80% of high-flow nasal cannula.  Infectious workup has been negative.  He has been too unstable to bronch.  COVID-19 testing has been negative.  He was started on high-dose steroids 5/8 with stability and slow gradual improvement.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

                                                pulmonary edema; Low heart rate; chest pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. An 80-years-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in left arm on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 Immunisation. Medical history included dementia, high blood pressure, COVID prior vaccination. He had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included diltiazem hydrochloride (CARDIZEM), anastrozole (ARIMIDEX), simvastatin and lorazepam. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 07Jan2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 Immunization. There was no other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient experienced pulmonary edema, low heart rate and chest pain on 26Feb2021. The events resulted in hospitalization and patient died. The patient was hospitalized from 26Feb2021 for 1 day. Treatment received for the events included Epinephrine, morphine, nitroglycerine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid test Nasal Swab post vaccination on 26Feb2021 indicated Negative. The patient died on 26Feb2021. An autopsy was not performed.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pulmonary edema, low heart rate, and chest pain, all reported as fatal, are deemed unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather accidental occurrences, likely favored by the patient&#39;s age and by the mentioned high blood pressure, known risk factor for  cardiovascular diseases.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Low heart rate; pulmonary edema; chest pain

Patient denied history of DVT/PE. In the ED, CTA-PE showed bilateral pulmonary embolic disease and Ultrasound confirmed acute right lower extremity DVT. Patient was started on a heparin drip and then switched to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours per pulmonary. Hematology/Oncology was consulted and determined that acute bilateral PE likely provoked by recent vaccination with the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Patient was switched to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily prior to discharge for planned duration of 3 months.

I did not have any pain exhaling  (only inhaling).  The pain was on my left ribs.  The pain was a 2 out of 10.  If I stood up the pain subsided to a 1.  I did not have any pain when I laid on my right side.  The pain occurred when a laid on my back and on my left side (the side of the shot in my left arm).  I slept that night on my right side with no pain.  Upon waking on April 17 at about 7 am the pain was about a 1 on my left side.  The pain stopped completely at about noon that day.

On11Feb2021, patient experienced dry heaves, pain and bloating in his stomach, his extremities felt cold and he was shivering, had night sweats and wasn&#39;t eating or drinking. He has been feeling progressively worse since Feb 11th, but she stated she has been taking his temperature and he did not had a fever but had been very thirsty. He had not been able to walk the last couple of days and had to use his wheelchair. Last night on 10Feb2021, he probably drank gallons of water due to his excessive thirst. His doctor told him to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which he did, but it didn&#39;t help. His symptoms have progressed such that the reporter dropped her husband off at the ER today. Reporter stated that he now did have a fever and is awaiting results of a chest x-ray and lab work (performed on 16Feb2021). He was having difficulty breathing, but his oxygen levels were normal. Reporter read online about two people in (city) developed transverse myelitis after receiving a Covid vaccine, but she was not sure which vaccine they received. She was calling to report this information to Pfizer and to see if these types of reactions have been reported and at 10 days post initial vaccination. The patient Is currently in the emergency Room and has not been able to eat for 5 days. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He reported to a facility like Urgent Care.  HCP recommended CXR which revealed questionable findings.  HCP recommended hospital visit but patient did not go that day.  Instead patient called ambulance to home the next morning and was transferred to the local hospital. Chief complaint chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Bloodwork ruled out myocardial infarction.  Various other assessments done over the first three days of hospitalization, including a CT scan which purportedly showed about a pulmonary emboli.  Most (if not all) of the emboli were in the right lung and were small and fixed/immobile.  At least one was larger.   Patient was started on heparin .  Echocardiogram workup ruled out presence of DVT in the legs.  Patient was discharged after 13-14 days in the hospital.

ER work-up concerning for severe sepsis with acute hypoxic respiratory failure for which he was admitted to the PCU under the hospitalist service.   Hospital Course He was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir but remained hypoxic requiring alternating trials of high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP for which pulmonology was consulted on 5/12.  Unfortunately, he did not tolerate prone positioning.  Despite his advanced age and several risk factors, he slowly but surely progressed from a pulmonary standpoint.  He was weaned off high flow oxygen 2 days ago and deemed stable for downgrade to MedSurg with telemetry at that time.  Since then he has continued to recover well, now requiring 6 L of oxygen with activity and 4 L at all other times.  He is anxious to be discharged home and appears medically stable to do so with home health care services, remote patient monitoring and outpatient pulmonology follow-up with PAL as prior to hospitalization.  Prior to discharge, all questions were answered and patient and his son expressed understanding, appreciation and agreement with the discharge plan at this time.   Treatments: IV hydration, analgesia: acetaminophen, cardiac meds: metoprolol, furosemide and aldactone, anticoagulation: eliquis, steroids: dexamethasone, respiratory therapy: O2 and remdesivir

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration second dose on 16Feb2021 (Lot number and expiration date was not reported) at single dose, via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 26Jan2021 (Lot number and expiration date was not reported) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (age at vaccination 82 years old), treprostinil sodium (TYVASO, inhalation gas, strength: 0.6 mg/ml), resp inhalation from 07Aug2018 to an unspecified date, at unknown dose and frequency; then from an unspecified date (Lot Number: 2101911; Expiration Date: 31Oct2021) to an unspecified date, at 4x/day (18-54 mcg, qid) for pulmonary arterial hypertension and treprostinil, resp inhalation from 07Aug2018 to an unspecified date, at 0.6 mg/ml; then from an unspecified date (Lot Number: 2101911; Expiration Date: 31Oct2021) to an unspecified date, at 4x/day (18-54 mcg, qid) for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included tadalafil. On 13Mar2021, the patient experienced COVID positive with mild infection, difficulty breathing, and nosebleed. On 31Mar2021, 2 years 7 months 25 days after initiating IH Tyvaso, the patient was readmitted to the hospital for breathing issues. The events COVID positive with mild infection, difficulty breathing was assessed as serious (medically significant and caused hospitalization). The events nosebleed and breathing issues was serious (caused hospitalization). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 13Mar2021. The action taken for the suspect drugs treprostinil sodium and treprostinil in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter did not provided causality for events.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse event of COVID-19, epistaxis and dyspnea as not related to IH treprostinil and TD-300/A device. COVID-19 was likely due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and epistaxis and dyspnea was likely a clinical cascade from COVID infection in setting of underlying PAH in this elderly 82-year-old patient.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (07Apr2021): New information received by Pfizer via United Therapeutics (MFR report #: UNT-2021-004686) from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife) includes: suspect product details (new dosing regimen for treprostinil sodium (TYVASO)), new event (breathing issues) and clinical course details.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (19May2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID- 19 positive with mild infection, which is considered failure of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162B2, and the administration of BNT162B2 vaccine. The Company considers the reported events Nosebleed  and Breathing issues  as  unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine,  more likely being inter-current medical conditions.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

Became bloated with severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath and difficulty walking due to pain. Tried OTC stool softeners, miralax, prune juice and no relief. Seen in ER on 03/20/21 for abdominal pain, bloating and constipation. CT scans did not provide answers. Seen by GI specialist and had colonoscopy and EGD on 03/29/21 which did not provide answers on sudden stop of bowel movement. Almost a month later still not having bowel movements regularly despite taking Linzess as prescribed, still have abdominal pain and bloating daily, difficulty eating due to bloating and pain, have lost 7 pounds in the past 3 weeks and now remaining in bed more throughout the day due to pain/bloating. Becoming depressed and irritable which was NEVER a problem prior to the 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

On presentation, pt with left gaze and right hemiparesis and LLE weakness. He was non-verbal and not following commands. Head CT showed no acute hemorrhage. CTA with perfusion did not show a large vessel occlusion or significant hypoperfusion. Clinical picture suspicious for ictal event so he admitted to the NSICU for further workup.

After a day at the hospital, the patient developed increased shortness of breath, had 80% oxygen saturation on a non-rebreather mask with subsequent upgrade to BiPap, and was using accessory muscles of respiration. His CXR on 4/25 on admission showed patchy b/l infiltrates. CT confirmed findings of CXR and was found to have ground glass opacities. The patient&#39;s ABG showed hypoxemia. On the morning of 4/27, the patient was found to be severely hypoxic and was electively intubated. As this form is being filled out, the patient is in the ICU on a ventilator due to COVID-19 pneumonia.

Both are still continuing to date.  He has been to his infectious disease doctor, his cardiologist, and to his nephrologist.  Shortness of breath continues.  He has also developed edema in his legs.  His heart condition worsened suddenly after the vaccine.  He will be having a heart procedure on 6/1/21 to address one of the issues.  At this point, there has been no improvement 10 weeks post vaccine.  As I type this report, I am sitting next to him as he helps me with the information and I can hear his breathing which is very labored.

                                                Patient vaccinated with first dose of Pfizer with subsequent infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Initial H&amp;P reads in part as,  &#34;Patients symptoms began on or around Thursday 3/11 when he began to feel  fatigued. After two days of fatigue, he presented to an urgent care facility on  Saturday 3/13. He was noted to have a fever there and was diagnosed with a  presumed UTI, though patient reports at bedside that he has not had any  dysuria. He was treated with nitrofurantoin and increased his furosemide  temporarily per urgent care&#39;s recommendations. He then presented to the ER  on 3/15 with continued fatigue and a low blood pressure at home. We were unable  to clarify the method by which the blood pressure measurement was obtained  and/or if it was repeated. Antibiotics were changed to cephalexin at that time  despite a relatively clear UA. His daughter brought him back to the ER today  (3/18) due to persistent issues with low grade fevers in the 100-100.5 range,  significantly worsening fatigue, anorexia, and oxygen levels of 92-93% on  nonproductive cough. Does not have a home O2 requirement. In addition, he  endorses feeling chilled during the admission evaluation. Denies any chest pain,  nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, constipation. # Fever Progression of symptoms from Saturday 3/13 may constitute original presentation  of Covid-19. Presentations on 3/13 and 3/15 with dyspnea and fatigue. Initially  thought to be UTI and was treated with nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. UA on 3/15  in ED was negative for leuk esterase and nitrites. Tested positive for covid-19  on 3/18 with lymphopenia, 90-92% on room air. No home O2 req. Given duration  of symptoms and worsening fatigue and fevers, will admit for treatment of Covid- 19. Also considered CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation as explanations for  dyspnea. Possible CHF exacerbation as well given 1&#43; bilateral pitting edema to  mid-shin and JVD to ear lobe. Suspicion for COPD is low given no report of  increased sputum production and questionable history in chart to begin with.  Would be beneficial to clarify history with collateral history 3/19.&#34;

Patient had a urinary retention because of the constipation.  He is able to void now.   Today morning, I am seeing him.  He is feeling better.  Is agreed to go home.  I discussed with the patient&#39;s wife regarding plan.  Once he fully recovered from pneumonia he need to have colonoscopy and possible biopsy of colon mass.

The patient was presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan2021. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb2021 from respiratory failure from COVID19. It was unknown if autopsy was done. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination via nasal swab: covid-19 virus test positive on 27Jan2021. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, and patient died.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID post vaccination and respiratory failure with fatal outcome, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.  More information on the underlying medical condition in this 89-year-old male patient is required for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from respiratory failure from COVID19; presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from

No medical treatment received because patient and caregiver were not warned that a DELAYED reaction to the vaccination could occur  Caregiver contacted primary doctor to report severe reactions, was asked if we sought epinepherine /ER  which we did not thinking patient had allergies, talked with cardiologist who thought patient was breathing like &#34;an almost 90 year old&#34;.... PCP advised patient to not receive 2nd shot given 1st shot reaction.

Got first dose of COVID shot wed.. A&amp;Ox1. Has left sided weakness from prior CVA  History of Present Illness     89-year-old male who presents to the ER via EMS with confusion.  He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.  He has a prior history of pleural effusion which is thought to be resolved.  He does have a history of lower extremity edema.  He had some urinary incontinence and his wife held his Lasix Saturday morning.  He was noted to be slightly hypoxic around 88% on room air.  He was around 85% or so on room air at home with their home pulse oximeter device.  He has been placed on 2 L of nasal cannula.

An 89-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6200), intramuscular in left arm on 24Feb2021 12:00 PM (received at the age of 89-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within the four weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included known COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), hypertensive heart, CKD 3 (chronic kidney disease stage 3), and history of breast cancer. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. He had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included multiple unspecified medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular in left arm on 02Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient developed shortness of breath (SOB) and bradycardia 3 days after vaccination, on 27Feb2021. 1 day after that, 28Feb2021, it worsened, and the patient was admitted with SOB and bradycardia. Has known COPD, not on any negative chronotropic medication. The patient was cleared after a day in the hospital. The reported adverse events resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days (28Feb2021 to 02Mar2021). As corrective treatment, the patient received oral steroid. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent Covid test post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 28Feb2021 with result of negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.
