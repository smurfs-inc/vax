                                                From ED Note: 12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.   Mom notes that he was in his usual state of health when he presented to COVID clinic to get his first vaccine. He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very &#34;wide eyed&#34; and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.   He had eaten a full breakfast prior to getting the shot.  He had a normal night sleep and a normal day yesterday per mom.   Medical History: as above  Surgical history: none Family History: Reviewed and no pertinent related family hx pertaining to this visit Social History: Lives with family  Allergies: food allergies  Medications: flovent, epi-pen Immunizations: Up to date  Medical Decision Making  12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.  On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan. He was discharged in a stable condition with mom at side.    **After patient was discharged, cardiology called the follow-up team due to the prolonged QTC to ensure that we were aware.  I contacted the patient&#39;s PCP to do a follow-up EKG in 1 month&#39;s time.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

Parent stated that the patient has a known allergy to peanuts but was assured that the covid19 vaccine from Pfizer does not contain any peanuts. I checked to make sure the patient didn&#39;t have any hives or swelling in any other areas of body and face. Patient was still alert and able to speak but did display some labored breathing. I had an EpiPen ready to administer but first gave him 50 mg of diphenhydramine liquid which he showed difficulty ingesting and continued to monitor while EMS was on their way. When EMS arrived they checked the patient&#39;s O2 and it was at normal levels. EMS determined patient was okay and gave the parent the option of taking the patient home or she could have him taken to the ER in an ambulance. Parent decided to take patient home.
