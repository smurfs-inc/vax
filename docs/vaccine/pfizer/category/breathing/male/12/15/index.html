                                                From ED Note: 12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.   Mom notes that he was in his usual state of health when he presented to COVID clinic to get his first vaccine. He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very &#34;wide eyed&#34; and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.   He had eaten a full breakfast prior to getting the shot.  He had a normal night sleep and a normal day yesterday per mom.   Medical History: as above  Surgical history: none Family History: Reviewed and no pertinent related family hx pertaining to this visit Social History: Lives with family  Allergies: food allergies  Medications: flovent, epi-pen Immunizations: Up to date  Medical Decision Making  12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.  On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan. He was discharged in a stable condition with mom at side.    **After patient was discharged, cardiology called the follow-up team due to the prolonged QTC to ensure that we were aware.  I contacted the patient&#39;s PCP to do a follow-up EKG in 1 month&#39;s time.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

                                                Significant chest pain started around 10 pm. He indicated it was sharp and intense and seemed to have some difficulty breathing at first. For the first 30 seconds the open mouth struggling look for breath had me thinking he was choking. Breathing improved but chest pain stayed intense for about 20 minutes. He went to sleep and the next morning said ?it kind of hurt but not much?. After the morning of May 23rd he hasn?t reported any other pain.

                                                Patient started to develop a cough on the second day of the vaccine around 6 pm. The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

Followed by runny nose, sore throat, croup sounding cough, shortness of breath, gasping, chest pains, vomiting, back of the skull pain. He described the head pain as a square from the base of the back of his skull to the crown of his head and back down. Felt more like a pressure in the bones of his skull and less like a standard headache. The chest pains are sharp and come on sporadically. At first they were accompanied by hacking cough but then progressed to sharp chest pains at random times especially when lying down.  He has difficulty sleeping and staying asleep. Also, lower abdominal pain but no vowel issues.

Complained of pain when taking a deep breath and would flinch in pain. By the time got to ER in the afternoon, pain had subsided. Not sure if vaccine related but never had chest pains before &amp; considering report of myocarditis after 2nd shot for younger males. Wanted this documented in case there is a pattern.

                                                major asthma attack; temp of 102; This is a spontaneous report from a consumer (patient parent) reported for son. A 12-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number Ew0177, on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose in left arm (at the age of 12-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient had seen his pulmonologist the day before and had a really good check up for his asthma. He had his shot on 14May2021. On 16May2021 he had temp of 102. On early hours of 17May2021 he had major asthma attack. Reporter was very well educated in how to help with an asthma attack. So didnt need to seek medical attention. But it took several nebulizer treatments, couple days a prednisone to get him back to his base line. His temperature lasted a total for 4 days and missed 5 days of school. Reporter did call his pulmonologist for directions on what to do. The outcome of major asthma attack was resolved in 2021. The outcome of temp of 102 was resolved on 20May2021.

                                                Had the vaccine on Saturday and on Tuesday afternoon, felt very dizzy, became very pale, had chest pain,  pressure in  chest and couldn&#39;t take a deep breath,  vision kept moving in and out, had to sit down, felt very hot and cold at the same time and was actually sweating and feeling chills. Took it easy for the next 4-5 days and just stayed home and in bed. When it got really bad, took a dose of ibuprofen.  The symptoms slowly got better and disappeared. Took about three doses of ibuprofen total over a few days. Talked to our pediatrician a week later who said we should report this.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

He used to carry an epi pen but does not currently, also has a history of asthma for which he carries a rescue inhaler. He received the Pfizer vaccine at approximately 9:15am in his left deltoid, and about 2 minutes later Mom notified me and the school nurse that he was starting to get &#34;hives&#34;. I noted a localized, small area of erythema on his left upper arm around the bandaid, approximately silver dollar sized, not raised. School RN removed the bandaid. He did not complain of itching and at that time stated he felt like he was breathing fine. The school RN gave him 50mg of Benadryl PO per the mom&#39;s request at 0920. The patient was in no distress, breathing and speaking normally. At 0922 he stated he felt like his throat and tongue were swelling, so I had him remove his mask, and asked mom if his lips looked swollen to which she responded &#34;yes&#34;. He stated it felt like it was hard to swallow. We placed a pulse ox on the patient and his oxygen saturations were 96-100%, HR 85-90, RR 30. We administered an adult epi pen (0.3mg of epinephrine) into his left lateral thigh at 0923 and had the school office call EMS. The patient remained in no acute distress, and said the swelling in his tongue felt better after the epi, but that his throat still felt swollen. Lungs clear bilaterally, RR remained 24-30, HR 110-115, pulse ox 98-100%, erythema on left upper arm resolved. Fire department arrived at 0935- report given and they checked a pulse ox as well. Patient walked to parking lot to ambulance for transfer to Hospital with mother following behind.

He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

                                                3 days after the vaccine, the patient woke up at 530 in the morning with sharp chest pain that lasted about 1 hour. He was also short of breath and the pain was worse when lying down. The day after the vaccine, he had fever and emesis, but that resolved within 24 hours. He was taken to  hospital where he was noted to have a troponin of 6.611, and CRP of 1.8. He was transferred to another Hospital for further care. He was treated with IV Toradol. He was seen by cardiology and infectious disease. He showed improvement with nothing more than NSAIDs, and since his MRI was normal, he was not given IVIG.

Around that time patient&#39;s parents came back up to pharmacy to notify staff that he had broken out into a rash in the back and his hands felt swollen.  I asked if he had any trouble breathing and parents stated no.  We followed the Adverse Event Action Plan.  We called 911.  Patient&#39;s parents then stated son is starting to have some breathing issue.  I came out with EpiPen and was going to administer when mom stated son&#39;s symptoms has resolved greatly and she did not want me to administer EpiPen.  Shortly after EMS arrived and evaluated patient and took him to hospital for observation.

On 06/07/2021 we dropped patient off at Soccer Camp. At 10am he started basic soccer ball control drills, which did not include rigorous exercise. At 10:30am we received a call from him, asking for us to pick him up as he had almost blacked out a few times.  We arrived at the sports field at 10:40am. I found patient to be red faced, sweaty, but cohesive. He described the following symptoms occurred during mild exercise: difficulty breathing, thirsty, fast heartbeat, &#34;black things&#34; over eyes, preventing clear vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty hearing, feeling faint  He took a water break and used his pro-air inhaler, as he thought he might have been having his 1st asthma attack (he&#39;s only ever presented with slight wheezing or night time cough). After a short break, his symptoms subsided, so he re-joined the group. After one more soccer drill, the symptoms came back again, but this time he experienced very hard palpitations and the feeling that his shoes were squeezing his feet. At that point he asked for permission to call to us and have us collect him.  We took him home and monitored him for a while. He seemed calm and symptom free. I had him shower and he was fine for the rest of the day.  The following day I had him jog on our treadmill for a period. He was symptom free. I increased inclination on the treadmill and he handled it ok without any of the previous symptoms. However, now realizing that he was within the 3 day window of his COVID shot, I decided not take him back to the soccer camp.   As of 06/13/2021 he has not complained of any symptoms returning. That said, he also has not performed any significant outdoor exercise since then either, besides walking.

He has not used his inhaler for over a year. The next day he had hives were much worse and his fever was going up. The hives were worse on his left arm and his arm was red around the vaccination site. He also had swelling in his face and he was having a little trouble breathing. I gave him Benadryl and Zyrtec which helped as well as Pepcid. The breathing difficulty subsided after that. He got a different rash on his back that was different from the original hives. We continued the medications and he was still Febrile until the sixth day. The sore throat is still present after nine days but the fever and hives are gone.

                                                On the night of the vaccine, patient developed fever (Tmax 104), chills, and myalgias. He had an outbreak of herpes on his shoulder.  Continued to feel very fatigued. Three days after the vaccine, he started having chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion. He continued to be fatigued. Chest pain was intermittent. Saw pediatric cardiologist at outpatient appointment on 6/15/21 where he had a normal EKG and ECHO.  High sensitivity troponin on 6/15/21 was 0.08. He had a Holter monitor placed. He was asked to do activity while wearing Holter monitor and self-limit based on symptoms. He played basketball that night and had to press the Holter button 8 times while playing when he was experiencing chest pain. When he got home from practice, he felt weak and dizzy with associated chest pain. Mom notes his nails were blue/purple, and he was &#34;lethargic&#34; . Symptoms improved with ibuprofen. Patient did not want to  do usual activity, mom called cardiology who recommended going to ED. Patient has not had chest pain since coming home from practice on 6/15/21.  He was admitted to hospital on 6/16/21. Repeat high sensitivity troponin was 0.82 on 6/16/21 and repeated on 6/17/21 was 0.41. Cardiology consulted. Cardiac MRI performed with normal results. He was dizzy on 6/17/21 when he got up to use the restroom, self-resolved. Cardiology evaluated him and cleared him for discharge with outpatient follow-up and self-limitation with activity.

Gave 10ml Benadryl 12,5/5 solution. Approx. 10 minutes later pt indicated he was having &#34;a little&#34; difficulty breathing. Dad said he has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and that his breathing was likely due to stress reaction.  pt was ok a short time later and dad said if reaction continued, or his breathing worsened that he would take him to the ER.  I followed up with dad an hour later and dad said the bumps were still there, but son&#39;s breathing was fine.

                                                Patient had the vaccine Friday morning (6/4/21). He had typical side effects that afternoon (tired, achy arm).  He woke up the next morning, 6/5/21, complaining that his chest hurt (with a stinging. constant pain), his heart was beating  rapidly, 102.5 degree fever, and he said it was hard to breathe. I gave him 200mg  Ibuprofen and he rested. Symptoms resolved in about 2-3 hours and did not return. I contacted the advice line at, and they set up a video appointment for mid afternoon on that same day, Saturday 6/5. By the time of the visit, symptoms were completely gone. PA recommended he have a Covid test as it was possible those symptoms were from having Covid ( coincidentally and simultaneously). The test was negative.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

On Monday while talking to other classmates in school, another kid said he experienced the same thing like him.   On Tuesday 05-25-2021, his mother states her son told her her felt some palpitations but as of today he has not had any more palpitations.

About 58 hours after the first dose, he started having trouble breathing. He called me in a panic and asked me to come home because he couldn&#39;t breathe. It took me ~15 minutes, and by the time I arrived, he was having some trouble breathing so we took him to the emergency room. They did some tests and sent him home. By that point, the symptoms seemed to have resolved on their own. But then he had some labored breathing later that night.

I reported to the closest worker and she called in another person, assuming one was a nurse and one was not.  She had him look into her eyes, which was difficult, then she had him out his head between his knees for a minute and he was then able to come out of it.  Still a bit dizzy, they moved him to a room with a bed where he could lie down and they put a cold, wet paper towel in his forehead.  He rested there for an additional 10 minutes.  They had him get up and walk before they allowed him to leave.  He had not eaten anything since the night before and he has severe ?needle anxiety ? which both could have contributed to the reaction.  He has not had any issues since, except for a sore arm.

According to the mother, the patient told her in the parking lot that he was having dizziness and a little bit of shortness of breath. So they came back to the pharmacy. The mother also stated that he had asthma when he was younger but that she suspected he grew out of it. He had no other symptoms of a possible allergic reaction. I gave him 10ml of Benadryl (25mg) as a precaution. They stayed 25 more minutes after Benadryl as a precaution, as the mother also contacted his physician for further directions. After that 25 minutes, the patient said he was feeling fine, and that they will be going to get something to eat.

                                                Patient was given vaccine with no initial side effects and was asked to wait for 15 minutes before leaving facility.  During that wait time patient started to develop blurred vision, and the pharmacist was alerted that the patient fell on the way to the bathroom.  Patient was then guided into the immunization room when he briefly lost consciousness. While patient was seated, pharmacist assessed for anaphylaxis reaction and contacted emergency services. Blood pressure was taken and noted to be elevated, other symptoms included blurred vision and sweating.  Patient denied itching, swelling, or trouble breathing. Patient did not receive epi-pen and was assessed by emergency services.  Patient recovered shortly after emergency services arrived, no further services were needed

                                                Exactly one week after the 2nd shot, patient was at a track meet and suddenly had a sharp pain in his chest.  It hurt when he inhaled, and he didn&#39;t compete.  He has never experienced this kind of chest pain before.  We thought it was an allergic reaction (hayfever?) because it seemed harder to breathe, so we gave him a benadryl and later went home.  He was tired and took a long nap.  Later he felt better.  But it was scary.  I think he underreported how he felt, to not alarm us parents.  He admits this now. There&#39;s not logical cause other than the vaccine ( no new foods, medications, experiences).  However, he didn&#39;t have any other notable side effects from the 1st or 2nd dose, except tiredness and arm soreness the first days.

I gave patient 50mg of diphenhydramine and observed patient for an additional 15 minutes, at the end of this time patient said numbness had resolved and the swelling was gone. I counseled both mom and patient to call 911 if patient were to experience difficulty breathing later in the day or if throat swelling/numbness returned. About 6 hours after vaccination patient complained tingling in legs and feet but no throat numbness or swelling, advised patient to go to urgent care. of Also advised patient to follow up with pcp.

Parent stated that the patient has a known allergy to peanuts but was assured that the covid19 vaccine from Pfizer does not contain any peanuts. I checked to make sure the patient didn&#39;t have any hives or swelling in any other areas of body and face. Patient was still alert and able to speak but did display some labored breathing. I had an EpiPen ready to administer but first gave him 50 mg of diphenhydramine liquid which he showed difficulty ingesting and continued to monitor while EMS was on their way. When EMS arrived they checked the patient&#39;s O2 and it was at normal levels. EMS determined patient was okay and gave the parent the option of taking the patient home or she could have him taken to the ER in an ambulance. Parent decided to take patient home.

                                                Client received the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine lot #EW0185 and expiration date 6/24/21 at 5:52PM.  Per vaccinator,  reports that client was saying, &#34;Wow that was aniclimactic&#34; after getting vaccine. Per vaccinator, she notices within 1-2 minutes client got quiet and then reported &#34;I am not feeling well.&#34;  Client received vaccine in left deltoid. RN requested PHN 1 to get gravity chair.  PHN grabbed gravity chair and asked RN to get BP cuff and pulse ox. PHN arrive to assess client and found client alert and oriented x 4 in chair at 5:53PM. Client was already drinking water given by vaccinator when PHN arrived.  Client reports he was experiencing &#34;dizziness and slight shortness of breath.&#34; PHN ask client if he thought he was steady enough to switch to gravity chair. Client stood up slowly and sat in the gravity chair. RN 1 asked client if his throat felt tight-client responds-&#34;No&#34; and coached client to take deep, slow breaths.  At 5:55PM vitals are: blood pressure: 130/90, pulse: 55 and oxygen: 98%.  At 5:57pm client reports no longer feeling shortness of breath.  Client is speaking in full sentences and able to answer all PHN questions about chest pain and headache and client reports having neither. At 6pm vitals: blood pressure:125/90, pulse:75, and oxygen:100%. PHN instruct RN to get Lead PHN  or Co-Lead. Client reports he has slight dizziness and feels lightheaded and reports that earlier he had blurred vision but now is seeing clearly.  At 6:03PM vitals are: blood pressure:160/100, client appears pale and heart rate:140, and oxygen: 100%.  Lead PHN  arrives to take over assessment and PHN starts calling 9-1-1 at 6:04PM as blood pressure is repeated by co-lead :180/90, oxygen100% and pulse 129 and upon auscultation hears clear lungs and heart palpitations.   Client is then reports shortness of breath and dizziness, no headache and no blurred vision.  Parent reports that client has a history of asthma but rarely needs inhaler so she does not have it on her and that client recently had been on antibiotics for Gastrointestinal history and a bad cough (not COVID)-all symptoms had been resolved before receiving vaccine.  At 6:07pm Vitals: blood pressure: 170/90, pulse:100%; no change in symptoms.  At 6:08pm vitals: blood pressure:170/90, pulse: 94, and oxygen: 100%, client reports experiencing tightness in chest and unable to complete breath. Client reports no chest pain. Vitals taken again by RN due to new symptom, blood pressure: 122/70, pulse:93 and oxygen: 100%.  RN auscultate again and hears palpitations have slowed and lungs clear. At 6:10PM, vitals are blood pressure:124/74 and pulse: 96. Client reports feeling &#34;shaky, tightness on chest&#34; and could not take full breaths.  Paramedics assumed care at 6:12pm. Client and parent left on stretcher with paramedics to be transported to Hospital.  Tell security that mother is leaving blue pathfinder in parking lot. Security assures he will not tow vehicle.

                                                My 15-year-old son received dose #2 of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine at 10:30am on 6/6/21. At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

In the morning pain much improved, but still with pain on deep inspiration relieved with leaning forward.  Repeat EKG shows diffuse ST elevation, consistent with presumptive diagnosis of myopericarditis. Repeat troponin at 9am of 9.3, BNP of 197.  Echo done wnl.  Scheduled for cardiac MRI with contrast per cardiology recommendation to r/o myocardial edema. Viral panel sent to r/o viral etiology despite no prior symptoms.

A 15-years-old male patient received bnt162b2, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 15 years old. Medical history included Autism and ADHD. Concomitant medication(s) included guanfacine. The patient experienced he has developed myocarditis, inflammation of the muscle in his heart that was caused by covid vaccine, chest was hurting; chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension on an unknown date, shortness of breath, tight chest  on 15May2021. Clinical course details was reported as: She thinks he has developed myocarditis. Experienced shortness of breath, went to the Emergency Department. She wishes for him to receive second dose. &#34;They did a bunch of tests&#34;. Saturday he had to rush in to the hospital because his chest was hurting, he has chest pain on Saturday that&#39;s why he went to the emergency room. The doctor said, he had inflammation of the muscle in his heart that was caused by COVID vaccine, she wants to submit that to Pfizer.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No, not exactly, he got the COVID vaccine on May 13th. He started developing shortness of breath and tight chest on Saturday night which is May 15th, I woke him up  because all night long he was complaining, I take him to the emergency room at the morning like 4:30 am, 4:30 in the morning of May 16th. The doctor told me that, he said that he didn&#39;t believe that it was a side effect of a vaccine because it was not, it didn&#39;t developed like within 1 or 4 hours to the vaccine like now when I&#39;ve seen on the news that the inflammation that is happening to some kind on the heart, he matches all the symptoms of that. So I need to know what do I need to make and what do we do for the second dose?&#34; Lab test: They did when he was in the hospital, When he was in the hospital 2 days after they did a bunch of lab test.&#34; Treatment: They did give him some medication in the hospital. The notes from the hospital they gave, they says he has tachycardia, hypertension, shortness of breath, chest pain. They gave him Ativan. Caller states she is calling about the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine and states she is thinking her son had the side effect that is being reported of myocarditis and took the 1st dose of the vaccine on 13May2021 and on 15May2021, at night he complained of shortness of breath, and a very heavy chest and moaned all night long; states at 4:00am she and her husband got up and took the patient&#39;s blood pressure and oxygen level and pulse and his blood pressure was elevated at 151/108, oxygen levels were ok at 96-97 and his pulse was 128, and his temperature was 99.7 she thinks. States they took him to the emergency room at that time because they did not know if something was going on with his blood pressure elevated. Caller states she has not reported this information to the patient&#39;s HCP and is calling to ask if she should wait or have to wait on the patient&#39;s 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine. Caller states she did previously file this report but was not given a report reference number and had to call back to ask for her questions. States the patient&#39;s 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine is scheduled for 04Jun2021. States given that they did not expect the patient to have any side effects and they do not want to be in this situation and are planning on traveling the day the patient is scheduled for his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine would they have to wait for his 2nd dose; states she wants to do things the proper way.

Pfizer is aware of the observations of myocarditis that occurred predominantly in a population of young men who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. There is no evidence at this time to conclude that myocarditis is a risk associated with the use of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Serious adverse events unrelated to, but close in timing to vaccination, are expected to occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. [for non-HCPs]: we refer you to your healthcare provider to discuss this topic. Your healthcare provider knows your medical history, can discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and can provide vaccination  recommendations to you. Pfizer is aware of the reports of myocarditis in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million people globally have now been vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. Serious adverse events unrelated to but close in timing to vaccination will likely occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. With a vast number of people vaccinated to date, the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive. If asked on the specific casesMore specific information on the specific cases or demographics are not currently available to Pfizer Medical Information. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

He was feeling a little short of breath and he had heart palpitations. We went to the ER and they did lots of testing. He had a fever and Sepsis testing. All results were normal and they gave him a Liter of fluids. He was discharged after two hours and his pulse was still high at 105-110. We monitored him and his heart rate was slowing and he started to feel better. His Endocrinologist had him take a double dose of Hydrocortisone the next day. His improvement progressed and by the fourth day the symptoms were gone.  He was able to do his normal activities but tired and worn out from the ordeal. One week later he had a slightly elevated heart rate but it resolved quickly.  He had had a local reaction in his arm with swelling and a rash after the first vaccine.

                                                Patient is a healthy 15 year old male presenting with chest pain in the setting of recent SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He was in his usual state of health until he received the second dose of the Pfizer/BNT SARS-CoV2 vaccination on Thursday 6/10. Shortly after and into the following day, he developed fatigue, chills, and a headache, which resolved within 24 hours. However, early this morning at around 2am, he awoke with sharp central chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, radiating to his left, prompting him to present to the ED.  Initially presented to Hospital ED. Vitals stable. Labs notable for troponin 0.07 and d-dimer 1.48. EKG with sinus rhythm, ST elevation in inferior leads. Given ibuprofen 600mg and contacted Cardiology, who recommended transfer to another ED for echocardiogram and further evaluation.  Here in the ED, vital stable, exam non-focal. Labs notable for troponin 0.13 and CRP 3.0; CBC, chem 10, LFTs, BNP, all within normal limits. CXR normal. Echo done which showed normal function (prelim read). Seen by ID who recommended standard workup for vaccine-induced myocarditis. He was admitted to the floor in stable condition.  Hospital Course: Due to rising troponin during hospital day 1 (peak 0.23), patient was treated with IVIG 2 g/kg (6/14) and methylprednisone 30 mg BID (6/14 - 6/15). On 6/15 a cardiac MRI was obtained that showed a small area of late gadolinium enhancement of the LV with normal function.  Troponin was trended every 12 hours and had decreased to 0.11 on 6/15 AM. He was transitioned to oral prednisone 30 mg BID to complete a total steroid course of 5 days (6/14 - 6/18). During admission he was found to be EBV PCR positive with all other viral testing including EBV serologies pending. It is still thought this is likely due to post-vaccine inflammation and not viral myocarditis but serologies should be followed up as outpatient.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  Prednisone for myocarditis  Famotidine for stomach protection while on prednisone  Discharged home with follow up tests scheduled for 6/17/21.

Rested and symptoms improved. Resting HR at the time of my call with him was in the 80s, but he reported low 100s when he was playing golf. Symptoms resolved with rest and hydration only. He did not need to go to the ER or be hospitalized.

                                                Patient felt like he was having an asthma attack on the night of the 21st when playing outside with friends (running and climbing). He has never had asthma, but said his chest was tight and it was hard to breathe. He said when he stopped and sat for a while it seemed to get better. He went to sleep at about 2am and woke me up at 5:20am crying. His chest hurt really bad and the pain was traveling down his arm. When we took his blood pressure at home it was 205/125 and his heart rate was 112. We went to the emergency room at hospital immediately. Once there they did an EKG. The doctor said there was not reason to be alarmed, but the EKG showed signs of possible pericarditis. They then took blood work, a urine sample, an xray and did an echocardiogram. The doctor told us that the blood work did not show any signs of an actual heart attack or any damage done to the heart. She said the echocardiogram showed some fluid build up in the pericardia sac surrounding his heart. She said this is considered pericardia. She mentioned that some young men are having this happen after being vaccinated. She said we seem to have caught it early. They gave him Tordal through his IV when we were there and that took his pain away. We were told to follow up with a cardiologist within 24-48 hours. We have an appointment at Hospital tomorrow at 10:45am.
