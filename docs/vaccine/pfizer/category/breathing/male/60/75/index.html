                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

Vaccinator noticed client had some trouble with balance as he was walking in so right after vaccine vaccinator was there as support to help client walk to observation area and then he seemed more off balance so she got him a chair.  Vaccinator alerted RN who walked over to observation area to get EMT.  PHN overheard client saying his &#34;throat is closing up&#34; and alerted PHN about emergency and then ran to get Ekit.  PHN got ekit from observation area and returned to client and other RN stayed to assist in observation area.  PHN called 911 at 12:40PM. Client reports having a diagnosis of lymphoma 4 months ago and being treated for fungal pneumonia 3 months ago to PHN who started to take notes.

At 12:44PM FIRE Department arrived and assumed care. Client was transported by paramedics out of the building at 12:53PM.

                                                About 1 week following first Pfizer vaccination, I began having achiness in left leg and thought this was possibly from sitting in a chair without enough cushion.  I simply could not get leg comfortable.  Over a couple days duration the leg continued to be achy and slightly swollen.  On December 23rd at night I awoke due to such discomfort in leg and could not get comfortable enough to go to sleep.   I went to ED where I was examined and found to be mildly short of breath and in pain.  Ultrasound of leg showed large upper leg DVT.  CT of chest showed submassive Pulmonary Horseshoe Embolus.   I was placed on Heparin and anticoagulated.  Hospitalized for several days while anticoagulated and observed for any clot progression or respiratory distress and discharged home on Xarelto for anticoagulation and follow up with PCP, Hematology, Pulmonary medicine.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 60-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Apr2021 (at the age of 60-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient lost motor skills, speaking and breathing issues accrued. The symptoms where coming and going. With the help of his wife, the patient managed to take one 0.5 mg clonazepam. The situation lasted for around an hour, after which the patient went to bed. The next morning, 29Apr2021, the patient still had a lot of joint and muscle pain. As soon as he tried to start some minor work around the house, the tremors started again, but this time the patient took clonazepam and rested in bed all day. Today, 30Apr2021, the patient was tired from the situation and will be resting also. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcome of seizure, &#34; tremor attack / tremors started again&#34;, joint pain, tired, weak, lost motor skills, speaking and breathing issues accrued and muscle pain was resolving.

                                                Pt was admitted on 5/10/21 c/o of rigor.  Patient complains of fatigue, weakness, intermittent fevers up to 100.8 °F.  EMS found patient to be hypotensive up to 84/52 and tachycardic up to 120s per minute. He woke up the morning of admission and then began to have shaking rigors at 10 AM and felt profoundly fatigued, dizzy and lightheaded.  Patient does have a history of COPD which is non-O2 nonsteroid dependent and has some chronic shortness of breath.  He does use inhalers and nebulizers and also continues to smoke.  He also has a history of melanoma who follows with provider.  In the ER he was found to have hypotension and was given 2 L of IV fluids.  He also had a 3 g drop in his hemoglobin over the past 5 days and there was concern for a possible upper GI bleed.  Because of the hypotension and drop in hemoglobin he was admitted to the ICU.  He was started on Protonix IV.  Chest x-ray, CT of the chest CT of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable for any acute process.  He was admitted for unspecified shock which was initially thought possibly due to sepsis but this was ultimately ruled out.  He was treated with 5 days of vancomycin and Zosyn and then antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient&#39;s troponin was elevated with an elevated delta.  He was seen In consultation by cardiology who felt that no further cardiology work-up was needed the cause for the patient&#39;s hypotension was unclear but his home lisinopril was discontinued.  he did require albumin but not pressor support.  As he was more stable he was transferred out of the ICU to the medical floor.  He was started on midodrine.  His blood pressure has improved he has remained afebrile throughout his hospital course he has remained stable off antibiotics.  At this time he is medically stable for discharge to home and will continue on midodrine for new autonomic failure/dysfunction. the cause for his fevers/rigors was not found

                                                Per triage notes on 4/21/21: Pt had his 2nd COVID vaccine today at 0800. At 0900 developed lip swelling. Took two doses of Benadryl and has now developed chest tightness and throat swelling. Per doctor&#39;s notes: Patient is a very pleasant 60-year-old gentleman who comes in for evaluation after a possible allergic reaction today, possibly related to a second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine that he got at 8 AM this morning.  About an hour later he started to feel flushed.  He felt like his face was warm and his ears were warm.  He started to feel like the inside of his mouth had filled with a rubber ball.  His tongue felt full and he started noticed progressively that he felt like he was having difficulty swallowing.  States that he never actually had any lip swelling, contrary to the triage note, just felt funny in the interior of his mouth.  Did feel like his tongue was slightly swollen, both based on the fact that it felt &#34;thick&#34; when he was talking, and on direct inspection, as well.  Took 50 mg of Benadryl around the time that his symptoms started, and lay down to nap for a little while.  When he woke up he was still feeling like he was having more difficulty swallowing.  He also felt like his face was a little bit puffy, prickly under each eye.  He also felt like he had a blotchy rash on his chest and upper back, which his wife corroborates.  He felt like his chest was a little bit tight and that something was heavy on his chest, though he was not wheezing or acutely short of breath, per se.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl at about 2:15 PM, and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation.  Currently still has a little bit of chest tightness and throat tightness.  He feels flushed.  Symptoms have not worsened, but they have not completely resolved, either.  He has had anaphylaxis in the past and has had to be admitted to the hospital.  And this was in relation to taking doxycycline, it sounds like. Patient presented again to the ED on 4/22/21 with the same symptoms. He was admitted with anaphylaxis. Per ED notes, also diagnosed with Angioedema, improved. Likely related to second covid vaccine. Cant rule out secondary to Lisinopril.

A 60-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single (patient was 60 years old at the time of vaccination) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that on an unspecified date, Friday or Saturday, the patent was complaining about breathing issues all of a sudden, he had respiratory or breathing episodes. The reported stated that that they called 911 right away, and they came and picked the patient up. The patient had trouble breathing and was complaining of pain, and he did go into cardiac arrest, but they checked, and it was not a stroke or a heart attack, none of those things, they cannot figure it out. It was reported that nothing was wrong with the lungs, and the hospital was treating the patient by currently having him sedated and treating his pain. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Blood pressure high, Cancer (Two or less years ago; In remission, Taking medication to follow through with remission period), Allergies and sinus issues, covid virus (in July). The patient reported soreness in the arm (15Jan2021), fatigue (15Jan2021) and  palpitations (16Jan2021) that he felt below the mouth and above the heart, calling it the esophagus area. He wanted to know if others had reported this same palpitation. The reporter further reported that he has a little bit of concern. He felt fine, had sore arm and fatigue that has gone away. Noticed lately, somewhere in his esophagus between his heart and mouth that he is feeling palpitations. Doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s more indigestion. Stated it could be gas. Sometimes comes and goes, feels different than what he&#39;s already experienced. Wanted to double check if this has been heard of or anything similar to it. Clarified product as first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Received last Thursday. Received COVID-19 Vaccine in left arm on 14Jan2021 between 15:00 and 16:00. Both arms are sore, but only because other arm is injured. Pain level in injection arm was around 5-6 and he wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side. Within the second day, 16Jan2021 in late afternoon soreness and fatigue was gone. Indigestion or Palpitations, feeling was happening again. They wanted to know if that is something he is experiencing from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Stated it doesn&#39;t appear to be related. It is around the esophagus. Stated it affects breathing. Stated maybe that has something to do with it. For the dose, they noticed it was a small amount of fluid in the tube that was injected into him. The outcome of the events soreness in the arm/sore arm and fatigue was recovered on 16Jan2021, while for other events was unknown. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

                                                Hospital course 1/31 ? 2/20/21 1/31 in ED pt was at home when children noticed his lips were blue, ems arrived and found him to be 50% on RA, on Non-rebreather pt got to 78%, covid on 01/26   Shortness of Breath   61-year-old male presents with EMS for evaluation of shortness of breath hypoxia.  History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

I was taken to an examination room at the vaccination clinic by their nurse director. Blood pressure was high and there was a question if I was having a stroke or heart incident. the director sent me by ambulance to Hospital as they didn&#39;t know if I was having an anaphylactic shock or cardiac incident. All this occurred within an hour if the first symptoms.

I tried to eat something and slept more. When I awoke, it felt like four huge needles piercing my lungs. I had to use my albuterol inhaler it was so bad. My symptoms are normally completely arrested by the use of Advair and Spiriva. The albuterol caused a dry heaving fit during which I expelled quite a bit of phlegm from my lungs. I felt better and the pain went away after that. Since then I&#39;ve been suffering higher levels of chest congestion than is normal for me.

                                                Difficulty breathing, like someone is choking me during inhale but no problems when exhaling.  I didn&#39;t have this problem while recovering from my covid-19 infection earlier this year. I tested positive for covid-19 on Jan 26, 2021 but eventually got better after three weeks and was back working.  I&#39;m still back working but can&#39;t do much more than sit around, I have a desk job. Advil helps but the difficulty breathing comes back after a workout, running, walking up hill, lifting weights.

The patient reported that he now has open wounds on his legs that bleed from the popped blisters. He also reported that it felt like all of his arthritis and muscles were affected.

                                                On Friday, April 23/ 2021 @4PM I began to feel pressure built up on my chest. @ 4:15 the pressure also built up on my neck. I was short of breath and I can feel the heartbeat way too high. I recall the person that gave me the first Pfizer shot to get ready for side effects after the second shot. @ 4:30pm the pressure was all over the back, the chest and the neck. Making things worse the jaw and lower teeth were also in extreme pain.  I laid down on the sofa and must have passed out. 20 minutes later I began to come around but I was way weak and the heart beat was beginning to relax. The body pressure was present till 6pm I did not know what to do at that time other than take a nap. I was not able to eat any food until Saturday 6PM.

                                                Narrative: Patient was found to be short of breath with heart rate in the 140s.  Initially he was thought to possibly be having an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  For this, he received prednisone, Benadryl and famotidine. These medications did  not improve his symptoms. He was then discovered to be in atrial flutter. He was  admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. There he remained hemodynamically  stable. He was treated with beta blockade that improved his heart rate and his  symptoms. He was discharged to home the following day.

His daughter in law text him at 0930 and he did not respond to the text (atypical) and then he missed a morning meeting.  His wife was downstairs in a meeting herself and after the meeting was over she called to him and he did not respond.  She found him with no pulse and was not breathing.  She called 911 and attempted CPR.  They did not complete an autopsy, they stated that they believe the cause of death was either an embolism, Heart attack or aneurism.   The wife stated that she does not believe the death was due to the vaccination; however, there were no tests completed to prove or disprove.

A 63-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as &#34;hypodermic needle&#34;), administered in arm left on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) at age of 62-years-old as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation from Sep2016 (Diagnosis date: Sep2016). Concomitant medications included diltiazem taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; metoprolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for blood thinner, start and stop date were not reported; pravastatin taken for blood cholesterol, start and stop date were not reported.

                                                Hospitalization, on ECMO, deteriorating lung function - now on lung transplant list, hx. sarcoidosis.  Question of whether vaccination caused worsening of lung function / sarcoidosis.  Still currently hospitalized.  Transferred to our organization for ECMO.    Hospital Course: Patient is 62y.o. male with PMH of Sarcoidosis who presented to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath. Over the past 2 weeks, patient has had worsening shortness of breath on exertion and also while talking. On 4/23, patient noted intermittent fever, TMax 102F. Patient was seen by his PCP on 4/25 and started on a zpack, and was also seen in our ED on 4/25. He was discharged home with OP pulm follow up. Since then, patient has been feeling progressively worse, He noted 4/27, that his pulse ox was in the 70s with ambulation and that the cough and shortness of breath were worsening.    In ER, patient has been placed on 6 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. He was also febrile with TMax of 101.5 F. POC COVID-19 testing was negative. WBC was slightly elevated at 10.7, Na level was noted to be 129. PCT was negative. CTA PE protocol was negative for PE, there was significant interval progression of nodular and consolidative opacities throughout both lungs when compared to 2017, compatible with interval progression of sarcoidosis. Patient was admitted for further workup and management.   Patient&#39;s oxygen requirements gradually increased. He was initially treated with IV antibiotics and antifungals. He underwent extensive testing, including urine histoplasma, cryptococcal, respiratory viral panel which will negative. TB QuantiFERON was indeterminate, along with elevated IgM mycoplasma for which he received azithromycin. Patient was also placed on IV Solu-Medrol initially, transitioned to IV Decadron. Inflammatory markers were elevated. D-dimer was noted to be greater than 10,000, he was placed on therapeutic Lovenox dosing. Patient did have Covid testing which was negative, he was also vaccinated. His oxygen requirements continue to increase, he was eventually placed on BiPAP, although due to lethargy and increased work of breathing patient was eventually intubated and sedated. He was also started on paralytics. Patient was transferred to another hospital for possible need of ECMO or lung transplantation.

A 62-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 21Jan2021 07:30  (62-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included psoriatic arthritis from 10 years (he started Cosentyx three or four weeks before reporting) and COVID virus from Nov2020. Concomitant medications included secukinumab (COSENTYX) from three or four weeks before reporting for psoriatic arthritis. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 31Dec2020 07:30 (62-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Patient states he just wanted to report; and he didn&#39;t know if this is significant. Patient reports now he has bilateral pulmonary embolism (from 04May2021) along with an upper respiratory tract something going on. Adds he never had this before. The doctor for his possible bronchitis has him on Omnicef and started Xarelto. Adds they were lucky to find the pulmonary embolism. Mentions the doctor tried a different antibiotic first, Keflex (NDC 68180 0122 02), and it was not helping. The doctor noticed his pulse oximeter (on 04May2021) reading was 92% and did a chest x ray. The chest x ray (on 04May2021) showed left lower lobe atelectasis. The doctor said that would not account for the low pulse oximeter of 92%. She sent him for a D Dimer (on 04May2021) that was positive, reading 1.95; and then had a chest CT at 1:00PM on Tuesday (04May2021), that showed the bilateral pulmonary embolism. Adverse events required a visit to physician office (received outpatient tests). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event possible bronchitis and included Omnicef and Xarelto. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Apparently the patient received his initial dose of COVID vaccine on 03/31/2021 and subsequently developed loss of taste and smell.  He was tested for COVID-19 at local Pharmacy and received notification that his result was positive. He subsequently had improvement in his symptoms and was retested 2 weeks subsequent with negative results.  On for 01/20/2021 he received his 2nd COVID 19 vaccination and subsequently developed recurrence of feeling ill 2 days afterwards. He progressively had feeling of shortness of breath along with nonproductive cough.  The patient then developed complaints of chest pain and rib discomfort.   He presented to the emergency department where he was found to be hypoxic along with abnormal labs including a creatinine of 1.84 BNP of 12,699, elevated transaminase levels, hemoglobin of 8.9.  Chest x-ray showed patchy airspace disease to the right lung consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.  At time of admission he was given IV Lasix and started on Rocephin and Azithromycin.   The use of steroids as well as any antiviral treatment was withheld because of presumptive symptoms related to bacterial pneumonia (secondary to COVID 19.) He also did not require oxygen supplementation during his stay.

Shortness of breath, tiredness and interference with my daily interactions. I would get tired about 30 minutes of anything. Whatever the medical term is for when you get tired easily, shortness of breath etc. Just basic AFIB symptoms. The Dr gave me Solital 2x per day and as soon as he did that, within two days the AFIB went away. He took away my blood pressure medication and gave me the Solital. But I still get tired easier than I did before.

After a few seconds caller&#39;s throat opened back up. States it was freaky. Never had that happen before. Throat opened back up, but scared patient real good.

                                                He got his vaccine, immediately had dizziness.  Within 30 minutes could not move real good due to the Parkinson&#39;s.  He got more confused, more dizzy, and worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s.   He was very thirsty and drank a lot of water (4 liters of bottled water).  He was then urinating and sweating a lot as a way of his body trying to get rid of something in his body.  He was urinating more than he normally does.  He started getting harder for him to breath.  He noticed he had a bad taste in his mouth similar to when he had the COVID virus.  He got a horrible splitting headache/migraine type that kept coming and going.  He still has the taste in his mouth, and it affected the taste of food.  These were all symptoms similar to when he had COVID.  The headache was worse than when he had the virus.  No appetite still, but still continuing to drink the water and not urinating like you did the first day and a half.  He is not having to drink as much as he did before and not feeling like he was dehydrating.  Does have the soreness from the vaccine or any rashes. He did have chills and low grade fever of about 100-101, which have resolved.  He also had a sore throat which he still has.   He had a very bad case of the COVID virus 3/1/21, which lasted for a week or two.  He still has some residual symptoms from the virus with balancing/dizziness or worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s disease.  His neurologist told him that he would recover from the cognitive effects from the COVID with his Parkinson&#39;s, but his motor skills may not return.

A 63-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6203), intramuscular in left arm on 09Mar2021 15:00 (at the age of 63-year-old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes from two years before the present report (2019), weakness in legs from three and half years before the present report (2017) and asthma from 2005 and ongoing (patient mentioned he had been sick with asthma for 16 years (2005), it was work related). No family history was provided. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included prednisone 10 mg, oral from unspecified date in 2005 at 20 mg and ongoing, daily (reported as two daily), benralizumab (FASENRA, lot number mm0071 and expiration date Mar2022) 30 mg/ml injection, parenteral from unspecified date at 30 mg cyclic (reported as one ml by injection once every two months), both for asthma. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks as well as no additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer vaccine were administered. Patient stated that the literature stated not to take any other injections of any kind. He was on FASENRA for his severe asthma. It is a blocker of eosinophils. He was due to have it once every 2 months, but it was on the same time as the Pfizer shot so he didn&#39;t take it. His asthma was getting worse. He was gasping and short of breath. He had been on prednisone for 16 years from the time of this report (2005). He was on 20 mg he could boost to 35 mg so he could deal with his asthma (and not get the FASENRA shot). He was 15 days overdue for his FASENRA shot. He needed to wait 3 weeks after his first dose to get the 2nd dose and wait more week to get his FASENRA shot. Patient asked if he could get up on prednisone and why it did state not to take any injections during and after the vaccine. At this point the vaccine was more important. He also asked what the reason was and if it was stressing on the injections. That was his main conflict. Patient also asked if having not had side effects did it mean that the vaccine had not work. As per response provided it was stated that there was no information in the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine prescribing information about a potential interaction or administration with FASENRA. Patient read not to take any injections because it might interfere with the vaccine. However, every two months he gets a FASENRA injection for severe asthma. He had it in his refrigerator for someone to administer to him at his house because he was afraid to go to the doctor or the hospital because of COVID. Reported his asthma started getting worse last week (Mar2021), he was unsure what day. He added he was on prednisone 20 mg and was still gasping for breath when he had to go up stairs. He added they also said there was concern about prednisone. He stated he might be able to stabilize if he went up on the prednisone. He added he was supposed to take his FASENRA injection about the same time as the vaccine and at the time of this report he was overdue for the injection. He added maybe he should just take it in a different arm. He was scheduled to receive the next dose of the vaccine on 30Mar2021. He added the FASENRA blocks eosinophils and he thought not having the FASENRA was contributing to his problem. He was asking what the prednisone did in relation to the vaccine because they asked him to wait longer and if he could take his FASENRA injection. He also asked if there were any medications he was not supposed to take with the vaccine. The event did not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the event was not resolved.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Bloodwork done, EKG showed irregular rythm, referred to cardiologist. Feeling better at time of visit, all additional tests ok. Weeks of extreme fatigue and lightheadness occur for periords lasting 6-24 hours at average. Any major activity would cause debilitating weakeness the next day. Felt so badly one night, thought he was dying, didn&#39;t go to ER (was affraid of expense). Another day again we drove to ER, but started feeling better during wait time and decided not to stay.  Was going to return if not feeling good, but felt better for 3 days, longest period to date.

Doctor visit on 6-5-21 and lab tests showed elevated D-Dimer results, indicating presence of a blood clot, where CT scan showed presence of &#34;extensive&#34; clotting, primarily in lower lobes.  Was prescribed blood thinner medication (Xarelto).  Remained in E.D. overnight under observation.  Results over the past four days are that breathing is getting better.

Patient was speaking in full sentences and states it was because he just took his inhaler medication. Patient states he is positive for chills onset Sunday. Patient did have his first dose of COVID vaccine on Thursday. Denies difficulty breathing on Thursday, and per patient could have started Saturday night. DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition:   1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation (HCC)  Patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on p.r.n. albuterol at home as well as nightly Spiriva, coming to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 days with associated tightness with his breathing.  On arrival to the emergency department, patient is sitting forward, tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse expiratory wheezing.  He is saturating low 90s on room air.  He is placed on 2 L nasal cannula for comfort.  He received 2 DuoNeb treatments with EMS as well as Solu-Medrol.  I am going to treated with a continuous nebulizer treatment and obtained laboratory workup as well as chest x-ray.  Vital sign show tachycardia which is likely from his albuterol treatment, he is mildly tachypneic, otherwise stable.   Patient&#39;s laboratory workup is reassuring, troponin is negative.  Chest x-ray does not show any consolidation.  Patient does have some improvement in his symptoms after his continuous nebulizer treatment.  His VBG is repeated after treatment and shows that his pCO2 is going down however he is still slightly acidotic with the pH of 7.28.  Patient reports that he still tight in his chest, improved however uncomfortable going home.  He is still significantly wheezing on my exam, given this I did discuss this case with emergency department observation who agreed to accept for admission.  COVID testing is negative.  Patient is admitted in stable condition. Pulmonary:     Comments: Patient is sitting forward in the stretcher, he is tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with expiratory wheezing in all lung fields.

                                                1- Mild cough became severe associated with  shortness of breath starting from second day. Since the symptoms were progressively worsening, on doctors advice took one course of Z Pack (Azythromycin) starting from Wednesday04/14. 2- Still having  mild cough. 3- Having dry upper respiratory passages leading to choking sporadically (once or  twice on some days  day). 4- Vision getting poor noticeable  with watery eyes,  started to feel 3 to 4 days after getting first doze COVID19 vaccination.  Consulted an eye specialist on 04/24, who believes the vision issue is due to cataract  getting progressively worse. As far as I know, cataract does not gets worse over period of 3 to 4 days, so there is likely hood of  some adverse effect of the COVID vaccination.

                                                On 04/22/2021, a patient was determined to have pericarditis, possibly secondary to COVID-19 vaccination. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer) on 2/27/2021. The patient reported feeling poorly and presented to ER on 03/02/2021 with chest pain and dyspnea. He states the chest pain he is experienced this week is similar to the 2 episodes of chest pain he had after each of the two-step Pfizer COVID vaccination that he received in February 02/27/2021 and March 03/15/2021. He underwent a stress test on 03/11/2021 which did not show any reversible perfusion defects. Of note, the patient had COVID-19 back in October 2020 which manifested with night sweats, malaise for a few days and then cleared completely without any &#34;long hauler&#34; symptoms. The patient was treated with ibuprofen and colchicine.  I did not find any evidence suggesting a relationship between pericarditis and covid-19 vaccination. In clinical trials, pericarditis was not statistically significantly different between treatment arms. Other potential causes of pericarditis include atrial fibrillation.

                                                My husband who is 64 years old, was a previously in good health. Only history was mild cardiomyopathy diagnosed 12 years ago. And elevated blood pressure, which was normal with medications. He was very active, maintained a demanding full time job and was a great husband of 2 children. He received his 2nd dose of Pfizer on approximately 4/1/21. He didn?t complain of any side effect. However, on the morning of 4/27/21 he woke me up saying that he could not breath. We started driving to the hospital, however he got worse and we stopped at the fire station. They gave his oxygen and rushed him to the hospital. We came to hospital and when the fire truck was pulling in, I was told that my husband went into pulseless electrical activity. CPR was started and after approximately 5 minutes he regained pulse. He was taken to the ICU and therapeutic hypothetic protocol was completed. Since then, he is still requiring mechanical ventilation. He opens his eyes spontaneously, at times appears to obey small commands and is bedridden.

VS remained stable throughout. some improvement now with prednisone. unclear if related to his vaccine but pt feels it was.

A 64-years-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; ), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 02Apr2021 (at the age of 64 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8733) as 1st SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe sleep apnea from 18Mar2021 (received a machine not long after),  gout (diagnosed about four years ago) , ex-tobacco user from an unknown date to an unknown date (two pack a day smoker over thirty years). Concomitant medication included colchicine (COLCHICINE) 0.6 mg, 1x/day taken for gout, start date was not reported to Apr2021. The patient experienced blood clots in his lungs (hospitalization, medically significant) on 02Apr2021 (also reported as 02May2021). , fainted, fell and hit his head, felt lightheaded/dizziness  on 02Apr2021, The patient was hospitalized from  2Apr2021 to 4Apr202.  It was reported the patient experienced hypoacusis and has a new hearing aid on an unspecified date. Caller says her husband has new hearing aids, which is why he is not doing the report himself.  Patient has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring  on an unspecified date.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: results unavailable on an unspecified date , &#39;they did a couple tests&#39; (details not provided)  results unavailable on 02Apr2021, urine analysis: results unavailable on an unspecified date.

The clinical course was reported as follows on April 2nd her husband received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately  an hour later they went to the market and he felt lightheaded, so instead of getting out of the car they sat there 20 minutes. He started to get out again then halfway out the door he fainted and fell down on the ground. She says he was out for, 5-10 minutes, clarified to not even a minute. Since he hit his head she called an ambulance, and they took him to PRIVACY in PRIVACY. They  did a couple tests and said since it was so soon after getting the vaccine that they did not think the vaccine had to do with his blood clots. Caller also stated he fainted because that was one of the side effects of the vaccine, but they were glad he got there since he had several blood clots in his lungs. On the same day (02Apr2021) he had a thrombectomy to remove the blood clots and put him on a blood thinner. Patient was admitted to the hospital April 2nd and was discharged April 4th. He  is doing better, he is on a blood thinner now. She says there were a few doctors that had to weigh in on whether he should get the second dose, they decided it wouldn&#39;t affect it since the vaccine goes into his muscle.  No  other vaccinations on the same days as his Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinations or during the four weeks prior.  Once they placed him on a blood thinner, they took him off Colchicine 0.6mg.  He stopped taking Colchicine because they said the blood thinner doesn&#39;t work with that particular medication.  It was also reported The patient is to schedule an appointment with a  rheumatologist and a hematologist, they did blood work and a urine test and said he has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring.

                                                shortness of breath which is been ongoing for the last several days.  His symptoms have progressively worsened over that time.  He was seen here in the ED 5 days ago and had a neb treatment for COPD, he had a positive D-dimer and negative CT angiogram of the chest for PE.  He was discharged home on Azithromycin and prednisone for AECOPD.  His symptoms unfortunately continued to worsen with increased cough and shortness of breath no fever, chills, sore throat, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  He came back to the ED today for evaluation since he was feeling worse.  Patient has a history of lung cancer on the right status post pneumonectomy in 2013.  On initial eval in the ED he was noted to have  bilateral rhonchi on the left greater than right and received neb treatments and Solu-Medrol 125 IV push.  His symptoms did improve somewhat.  ED staff checked a COVID 19, despite confirming his second Pfizer vaccine was received on 3/21/2021, and it came back positive.  Procalcitonin was negative.  He clearly has an exacerbation of his COPD but with the COVID 19 positivity, the ED staff was concerned with his comorbidities that his prognosis is poor in the face of progression of symptoms.  I was contacted and agreed to admit him for Remdesivir therapy, supplemental O2, dexamethasone and supportive care.

                                                Shortness of Breath for few days after vaccine #1; after vaccine #2 shortness of breath increased along 10 day period, so I contacted PCP. Clinical exam, chest xray, blood work resulted D-Dimer level increase, so CT scan ordered. Result was lungs full of PE. Placed on Eliquis and referred to hematologist. Hematologist ordered deeper dive in blood work as well as echocardiogram, which displayed a widening in aortic root and ascending aorta, but no ventricular or valve damage. Dr. will continue to monitor and refer me to cardiologist. Other symptoms include unprovoked fatigue, some shortness of breath, a strange smell of burning plastic and cramping of the upper part of my feet, only at night. Never tested posit  positive for COVID with wife and son both had &#34;undocumented&#34; COVID in January and March 2020. They both have antibodies (confirmed with blood testing) and I did not have antibodies. Our physician would not authorize a test for COVID at the time of their symptoms as tests were so coveted and not authorized widely at the times of their illnesses. I really want someone to come forward and confirm the causation and correlation of my symptoms to the vaccine, because I am otherwise an extremely health and active 64 year old with no preexisting or predisposed conditions to widespread PE...not just a clot or two...it is wide spread throughout all lobes of my lungs!

I am a right side sleeper and I couldn&#39;t sleep on that right side. I went back to the surgeon who removed my gallbladder. No treatment was given because no cause of the pain could be found. I started feeling less pain while breathing while I was in the waiting room. Over the next 3 days, the pain got gradually less to a point where it was not hurting at all.

                                                Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia; Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia; Couldn&#39;t breathe; Pneumonia due to MRSA/Ground glass pneumonia; weak; lost 20 pounds; fever; Cough; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient himself). A 64-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EN6208, Exp 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 16Apr2021 11:00AM (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included heart disease ongoing from 1997 (this happened in 1997 and the patient had been living with it for a little while), heart attack, pacemaker defibrillator because of cardiac arrest (in 2011), atrial fibrillation (diagnosed a little while, he was not sure and had been in and out of the hospital and to heart doctor quite a bit) and hypertension. The patient was administered with first shot of BNT162b2 (Lot number EW0153) in left shoulder on 16Mar2021 11:00AM (at the age of 64-year-old). Concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Apr2021 after the second dose, the patient was fine. There were no reactions after the first dose, but the second dose two days after he started developing a cough and fever. He thought it was a side effect but then ended up in the ER with pneumonia. They gave him antibiotics and sent him home. He went through the antibiotics and went back because he was still sick and not responding. They gave him more antibiotics and sent him home. He went through that batch and ended up really bad so he had to call an ambulance a few weeks later. He was diagnosed with MRSA Pneumonia and stayed in the hospital for 5 days. Then, he was discharged. He went back to the ER again a few days later because he did not seem to be improving.  He was coughing and was weak. He was given another batch of antibiotics. He did not know if it was from the shot or what - he was healthy until then. The patient added that she lost 20 pounds and confirmed that it was following the vaccine. Two days after the vaccine, maybe it was 19Apr2021, he had a fever and it was now gone (exact dates were unknown). Cough happened at the same time of the fever but it was not as bad, and then progressively got worse. His lungs started filling up. They thought it was COVID. by the x-rays it looked like COVID lung but they took a sample and it was MRSA (exact dates were unknown). His admission was 18May2021 and was for acute respiratory failure with hypoxia. Discharge paperwork said acute chronic combined systolic diastolic congestive heart failure but he has had that for many years.  It also stated primary hypertension but he has had that. The paperwork sayid pneumonia due to MRSA and pneumonia due to unspecified organism. He was hospitalized 18May2021 through 23May2021 with pneumonia and the reason he was hospitalized was because he could not breathe. Lost 20 pounds: after he started getting sick from the beginning of it all, he was coughing and losing weight and all that.  It may not be quite 20 pounds, maybe 17, but he just knew that he was down quite a bit. He was 160s now, he was high 170s before (as reported). Treatment included Lasix and all kinds of different antibiotics. They were giving him, he did not know what it was, at first. Then, they narrowed it down and once they found out it was MRSA they gave him Clindamycin he believes. Investigations: they did CT scans, chest X-rays, and labs but he does not know any information. Each time they did a chest x-ray, when he went to get a chest x-ray, each one was worse all the way up to when he was admitted. When he went, they did a bronchial scope or whatever, he was not sure, and they saw lots of swelling and infiltrate. He did not know what this meant, stuff was infiltrating into the tissue and it was not just in the airways. He added it looked like ground glass pneumonia is what they said. The patient added that he was usually pretty active and cannot do anything anymore. He had three or four Covid tests, all negative, no additional details provided. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

I was walking flight of steps when i felt i was not getting enough air, i went to sat down and was unable to recover and went to the therapy office to sit down, where a coworker said i didn&#39;t look good, my BP 148/92. I felt sleepy, global weakness throughout my body. they took me to the ER where i had an EKG, CBC, thyroid test, angiogap glucose test. The EKG was normal and I stayed about 6hrs in the ER but went home. As the day passed my BP was 122/88 when i got home.  I wore a holter monitor for 5 days but don&#39;t have results yet. I felt fine for the next 6 days. SECOND EPISODE 01-21-21; i  woke up at 5am feeling so sad with despair and feelings of loneliness. I went to  work 11:45am, felt fine, sat down to do some work on my computer and I could feel it come up again, went to nurse station and checked my BP 144/90, i could feel my heart pounding and went to the ER again. I felt super foggy and unable to process things. They did a CTA of my neck and chest and a CT with perfusion which was normal. They did lab work and all was normal.  THIRD EPISODE 01-25-2021, i was at home happened around 9am, felt fine all morning and then i felt another episode come again. Same symptoms just not as dense as before and texted my wife. I had body aches, felt like I had the flu.     I saw my PCP 01-25-2021 (same day as my third episode)and set up an appointment  with a neurologist.

                                                Full body flush, head to toe.  A bit light headed.  A slight wheeze.  The clinic was completely unprepared.  They showed up with an infant bp cuff.  30 minutes later they showed up with a bp cuff that did not have batteries.  I was fine, not particularly concerned but they seemed completely unprepared.  That night felt a bit drained.  Slept 12 hours .  Feel fine this AM.

Used Albuterol inhaler twice, 5 minutes apart, and took Prednisone 20 mg orally.  Within 60-90 minutes, symptoms completely resolved and did not reoccur.  He did not seek medical attention at the time of this reaction, but called this office on 3/11/2021 so that the reaction could be documented.  That prompted today&#39;s office visit and the completion of this VAERS form.  Patient does have monthly allergy injections, but last injection was on 2/23/2021.

A 65-year-old male patient received a first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 (Lot Number: EK9231) as single dose for prevention. Medical history included pulmonary fibrosis and dyslexia. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported &#34;excruciating joint pain after receiving 1st dose Pfizer vaccine. Second dose was scheduled for 04Feb2021. Patient stated that three days after receiving the first dose he had arthritic pain, on thumb - like he broke his thumb (he put on aspercreme and took Advil) but night it went away. The next day my left foot (he put on aspercreme and took Advil), then moved up to his right wrist. same thing. excruciating joint pain and it would move around, it started on his thumb one his right side, then went to toes on left side, it was his whole body, both elbows, now he can&#39;t lift his left arm (injection arm) for 4 days. There is pain in his shoulder, he can move his shoulder, but to do the chicken wing with his arm, he cannot do it. Got the shot on 14Jan2021, this started 3 days later. To switch positions, from his toes to his knee joints, and it is both sides of his body. His little joints are there one day and gone, he puts Aspercreme on and took Advil, and by night time the pain was gone, but the next day it was somewhere else. The smaller joints, like in his toes and knuckles on his hands, lasted one day, but his knees, bigger joints, was 2 days, his wrists were a day, it even went up to his jawbone, he couldn&#39;t suck soup, so it&#39;s pretty bad when you can&#39;t drink soup. His left arm had been going on for 4 days. He went to his rheumatologist, and the doctor he took 9 vials of blood, because caller&#39;s next shot is supposed to be on 04Feb2021, and he was up in the air about getting it with all the pain going on, so the doctor took a look, did 9 vials of blood, and said right now he would not advise getting it until he looked at the bloodwork to see if there was compatible, and the doctor said he would be in touch by the 4thFeb2021. Patient stated he was dyslexic. He also stated he had a hard time getting around with oxygen. Patient stated that he sees a lung specialist for the last 5 years, he has pulmonary fibrosis. Seriousness of the event was reported as non-serious. The patient underwent lab test that includes bloodwork: unknown results on an unspecified date. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                hypoxic; shortness of breath; opacity in the mid and lower L lung; tachypnoea; tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 29Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER8734) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization but reported to have had DOE for the past 3-4 days, has felt fatigued for the past week and his taste seems different over the past couple of days. It was reported that during the 15-minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience shortness of breath as he was walking out to the front. He reports no issues with the vaccine as he was waiting. He denied rash, hives, welts, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, throat tightness, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. The patient complaints of shortness of breath. There was no treatment therapy provided. Follow up response to treatment was excellent (also reported as no treatment provided). The patient was discharged as stable to go home and follow up with PCP (primary care physician). He completed his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (29Mar2021). He presented to respiratory clinic earlier today (30Mar2021) and was noted to be hypoxic and was sent to ED. He reported DOE (dyspnea on exertion) for the past 3-4 days and has felt fatigued for the past week. He notes that his taste seems different over the past couple of days. CXR (chest x-ray) on an unspecified date in 2021 shows opacity in the mid and lower left lung. He is tachypnea, tachycardia, high normal WBC and afebrile on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray showed opacity in the mid and lower L lung and white blood cell count was high normal on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further Information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of hypoxic cannot be excluded.

He had a possible bacterial superinfection.  His procalcitonin was elevated.  We therefore treated him with antibiotics for the bacterial superinfection, and treated him with convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his Covid infection.  Patient is doing much better now.  He is breathing well on room air and feels ready to go home.  Physical and Occupational Therapy saw him and they recommended home health at discharge.  We are talking to the patient about whether he prefers to go to a inpatient rehabilitation facility versus home with home health.  That is still up in the air at this moment we will follow whenever pathway is most appropriate.   The patient did have some elevated liver function test on admission but these are better at the time of discharge.  He also has continuous narcotic dependence and is getting frequent opioids.  This is keeping his chronic back pain under control.   On the day of discharge the patient is feeling very good and is eager for discharge.

I also experienced a slight metallic taste in my mouth. I also sensed a somewhat increased heart rate and some slight dizziness. I did NOT experience any breathing difficulties but maybe had a very slight wheeze sensation. These reactions lasted only about 8 to 10 minutes then started easing away. I was monitored a full 30 minutes and then released after reporting I felt ok then.

Patient stated they were also having breathing difficulties. Immediately tested patients bloods pressure. Tested twice and came to 220/120 with heart rate 80. Was an emergent situation. Informed patient I was contacting 911 to have them take him to the hospital as this is an emergency situation. Went and made phone call. Had staff bring patient into waiting area so that we could monitor him if something worsened. 911 advised to just monitor the patient. If he began vomiting or passed out to have him on his side, so he doesn&#39;t choke from vomit. We monitored patient until ambulance arrived. They asked for current medications we knew of (listed in report) and that he had received Pfizer Covid vaccine 0.3ml resulting in emergency BP readings of 220/120 after receiving.  Ambulance took patient to Hospital. Current condition unknown or if anything even occurred after that point. Whole event lasted about 1 hour before patient left with medical personnel.

They felt he could have had a TIA, or extension of a prior CVA (nothing new on MRI, has small vessel ischemic disease), or a COVID vaccine reaction. Symptoms have mostly resolved, he is not always cooperative so subtle weakness is difficult to detect. He was hospitalizaed, started on ASA &amp; increased BP meds, and returned to his home, where he has resided for several years.

                                                I was going up and down a ladder while painting the eves. I bent over trying to catch my breath with my hands on my knees.My wife who is a nurse said that&#39;snot normal and we need to go to the hospital. While driving there I felt a tingling in my entire body and thought I was going to pass out. We got to the hospital and they hooked me up to a monitor.  My heart beats were super low and jumping all over the place throwing PVC&#39;s. It showed my rate going down to 28 beats and then back up to 60 and down again.It was all over the board. They decided to keep me overnight for observation and tests. Saturday night they drew blood twice to run tests and took urine samples.  Here is the list of tests, doctor and dates:  NM STRESS TEST 1/2 (RADIOLOGY) , MD Apr 12, 2021 Imaging NM STRESS TEST 2/2 (CARDIOLOGY) , MD Apr 12, 2021 Imaging ECHOCARDIOGRAM 2D COMPLETE W OR WO CONTRAST PRN , DO Apr 11, 2021 The result is abnormalLab LIPID PANEL , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab CBC , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab MAGNESIUM , DO Apr 11, 2021 The result is abnormalLab BASIC METABOLIC PANEL , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab TROPONIN I , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab TSH , DO Apr 11, 2021 The result is abnormalLab HEPATIC FUNCTION PANEL , DO Apr 10, 2021 Lab URINALYSIS AUTO ONLY , DO Apr 10, 2021 Lab URINALYSIS REFLEX TO MICROSCOPIC-INPATIENT , DO Apr 10, 2021 The result is abnormal Lab D-DIMER,QUANTITATIVE , MD Apr 10, 2021 Imaging XR CHEST 1 VIEW AP PORTABLE , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab CBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL , MD Apr 10, 2021 The result is abnormalLab BASIC METABOLIC PANEL , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab TROPONIN I , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab MAGNESIUM , MD Apr 10, 2021 The result is abnormalLab BNP PRO , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab CBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL REFLEX MANUAL DIFF , MD Apr 10, 2021 Other type of result ECG 12-LEAD , MD Apr 10, 2021  Results are that they did not find anything really out of whack to cause the symptoms.My heart beats jumped up to 190 and they put me on beta blockers for now.

She reports premedicating herself before the vaccination with 1 Pepcid and 2 Benadryl.  However unfortunately within 13 minutes of receiving the vaccine she started to experience a and irritation of the tongue/throat with tingling sensation followed by throat hoarseness, a cough and a red face.  She was experiencing a little bit of chest tightness in addition to a little bit of shortness of breath and therefore used her albuterol inhaler.  Shortly thereafter her red face improved.  EMS was called to the scene however by the time they arrived she was improving and was sent home.  She took a Benadryl at home later in the evening and the following day on Friday she started Pepcid daily since that time. She states since the vaccine she has felt poorly describing exhaustion and feeling achy all over with continued raw throat.  She has not warranted use of her albuterol inhaler since last Thursday and ran out of Benadryl Thursday evening only utilizing Pepcid daily and continues on her other medications. She reports a history of allergies to petroleum products including polyethylene glycol which is suspected to be the cause of her allergic reaction

                                                Resident was vaccinated on 12/31/20. Then on 1/14/21 he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine surveillance PCR testing.  Another resident on the same hall was COVID positive on 1/11/21.  Results of the PCR test were obtained on 1/16/21.  He appeared asymptomatic at that time. Given his COVID positive status, all aerosol generating procedures had to be stopped. Overnight on 1/16/21 into 1/17/21, he had the onset of acute respiratory failure and was transported to the hospital. Per notes, he was put on BiPAP for several hours, but his CO2 level did not improve. Per prior advance directives completed with the resident and his two brothers, he had DNR/DNI orders.  The hospital physician spoke with his brother and the decision was made to  move to comfort care. He was discharged to inpatient hospice and died around 4pm on 1/18/21. This outcome does not appear to be vaccine-related, but death from COVID-19 infection is listed as a reportable event following COVID-19 vaccination.

Symptoms increased the next night, increasing each day to peak on day 8 (02/19/2021. Symptoms gradually decreased thereafter until 02/26/2021 at the time of this note. Symptoms are now very minor residual intranasal congestion and slightly more significant chest congestion. Symptom trajectory started as rhinorrehia and pronounced nasal congestion that partially responded to decongestants and improved more with nasal fluticasone. Bronchial congestion began after on day 3 to 4, with shortness of breath experienced overnight (never before experienced). Remarkable, intense aerobic exercise was done with no difficulty during the day, with some moderation taken on 02/19/2021. Fatigue did affect daily activities, but not dramatically. That this was a vaccine side effect signal is clear to me.

                                                Trouble breathing  Narrative:  Patient presented to the ED 2 days after first dose of COVID vaccine  with a pruritic rash as well as trouble breathing. He reported the rash which was  urticarial and quite pruritic was generalized, ranging from his face over his neck  and back. Initially he had little relief from diphenhydramine, but after a second  dose the rash was largerly resolved. Patient denied chest tightness, wheezing,  tongue or lip swelling. He did not report any GI symptoms, fevers, mild myalgias  but only with a slight headache. No loss of taste or spelled sensation. The rash  most prominent on the right forehead raised a suspicion of herpes zoster which  could also cause a headache, but ED provider ruled this out because patient had  received his herpes zoster vaccination. The rash was also not painful although  bilateral and asymmetric. ED physician concluded it to be a mild reaction to the  vaccine. Patient was discharged on H1 and H2 blockers (diphenhydramine and  famotidine)

Patient received the covid19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 2/9/2021, vaccine was administered without complications. No prior positive for covid19. After patient received his covid19 vaccine, he was seen at same day access for increased SOB/DOE, worsened orthopnea. Per progress notes, at this last appt, patient had expressed a number of medications which he was not willing to take, attributing his worsened health to their effects. Pt has continued spironolactone despite being advised to stop it by his medical provider. At the time of visit, provider noted that this kidney function was declining (patient does have CKD). Provider discussed the importance of medication adherence and patient was started on torsemide. Hctz was discontinued, minoxidil was increased due to patient preference. Prior to this same day access/express care visit, patient was hospitalized from 1/26 through 1/28/2021 for hypertensive urgency (211/105) and that at that time, pt already had orthopnea, SOB, and dyspnea. Patient was also admitted from 1/7 to 1/8 and left AMA. While inpatient, his MRI revealed a pontine lacunar infarct that was found to be chronic. It was recommended that patient be treated with aspirin/plavix for 21 days then aspirin alone but patient declined.

                                                Two days after shot woke up with sunburn like rash on face and back.  Was short of breath and dizzy. The rash looked like little blisters on top of bumps on my face, with red rash looking spots on back, legs, and chest. The skin on my face started pealing on my face and it burned and itched. Went to see my Pulmonary Doctor first, than Infectious Disease Doctor than Primary Care. I was treated with steroids, creams and inhalers.  Symptoms would get better than repeat for the first month. Still not feeling like I am ok.  Have two more doctors appts. coming up.

A 67-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 67 years). Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]); lisinopril; insulin taken for diabetes mellitus. The patient experienced thrombocytopenia, he had clot in the legs and in the lungs and have a low platelet count on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CBC: unknown result on 08Apr2021, Heparin associate antibody: unknown result, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP): unknown result and platelet count: low on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of thrombosis included Heparin drip and Argatroban. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are considered unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather intercurrent occurrences. Clots in the legs and in the lungs were likely favored by the mentioned diabetes and by a possible hyperlipidemia (the patient was taking  atorvastatin) in a setting of possible arterial hypertension (the patient was taking lisinopril).  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                He got his vaccine, he sat down for 20 minutes, he felt OK, went to his car and sat in his car and started feeling dizzy headed.  He felt like a panic attack, and felt uneasy driving.  He got home and sat for a while and noticed that his body was getting sore, and felt like he had the COVID virus and felt fatigued, joint pain that was worsening.  He did not have a fever and then had diarrhea and vomiting that lasted for a week.  He called an center after he talked to his doctor the first time, and they told him that he had to hang in there as 20-25% of their patient&#39;s were from the vaccine and that it would go away in a couple of weeks or so.   He possibly was exposed to COVID from somebody working in his house.   He took Ibuprofen for pain and soreness.  He is still having the fatigue and brain fog and sometimes can&#39;t get his words together.  He works part-time and is not able to do so at this point as a substitute teacher.    The symptoms are getting better, but he is still not back to his normal self.    He has lost a lot of coordination at this time, was an athlete and gets out of breathe walking 50 yards to his mailbox.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                Three days post-vaccine, I began to experience chest pressure and slight pain in my chest--directly under each of my armpits. After 3 hours I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and they suggested I call 911 and go to the Emergency Department to be sure I was not having a heart attack. Multiple EKGs, a chest xray, and blood tests revealed that my heart was in good shape. I have continued  to have very slight pressure in that area, but it is occasional and is almost gone. Even after 5 days since the vaccination, I am experiencing side effects although they have reduced in severity. Fatigue, occasional slight dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, occasional slight pain in various parts of my body.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

                                                Shortly after 1st dose (within 1 week), I developed shortness of breath. At first, it was intermittent, then as time progressed it became more &#34;permenant&#34;. I received the 2nd dose on february 23rd while still experiencing daily shortness of breath. Occasionally experienced loss of taste but that went away. I went to my doctor &amp; he took chest X-Ray. Showed partial &#34;collapse&#34; (right lung not functioning properly) of right lung. My doctor suggested &#34;deep breathing excersizes&#34; to re-expand portion of lung affected by side effect. I need to have additional X-Ray in 2 weeks (March 19th, 2021).

He was having leg pain, so he probably had a blood clot then; really, really sleeping; really bad leg pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient&#39;s wife). A 68-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8729, initially reported as FR8729 then stated it is an E) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Apr2021 around 10:00 or 11:00 am (68-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure (also reported as family medical history), ongoing eurofibromatosis (Has had all of his life), varicose veins, overweight, rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications included ongoing etanercept (ENBREL) for rheumatoid arthritis (Has been on a few years but does not remember how long exactly). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration at arm on 13Mar2021 (68-year-old at time of vaccination) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received flu vaccines in Oct2021 (67-year-old at time of vaccination). There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The wife states her husband (patient) got 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The middle of last month, he was complaining of really bad leg pain (from middle of May2021). He does have varicose veins and is on Enbrel and is overweight. He was really, really sleeping. She told him that he really needed to go see a doctor. The wife states she is in a rehab facility and is a pharmacist who worked at the hospital for over 34 years, mentions licenses in (states name). The wife stated she sent him to urgent care and they said he had varicose veins but had no problems with his leg. They did diagnose him with pneumonia. They sent him home on an antibiotic, Doxycycline 100mg, she didn&#39;t actually see the prescription, it was either for 7 or 10 days. He was down to one dose the day before yesterday. While he was at home, she heard him coughing (from 03Jun2021) and he couldn&#39;t stop coughing for about 5 minutes. She asked him when his follow up was and he told her not until Friday. She said he needed to see somebody so yesterday, he went to urgent care again. Three hours later they transferred him by ambulance to the hospital, he had blood clots in his lungs (from 03Jun2021). She is highly suspect of the Covid vaccine because he has never had problems like blood clots before. He was just admitted on the day before reporting (hospitalization for coughing and blood clots in the lungs from 03Jun2021 and ongoing). The wife is thinking maybe they misdiagnosed him approximately 10 days ago. She thinks that he had a blood clot in his leg that travelled. He was having leg pain, so he probably had a blood clot then, and they misdiagnosed him as pneumonia. The wife does not remember exact date but that it was in middle of May. His first trip to urgent care was 10 days before going to the hospital. Coughing started the same night, she asked him to go to the doctor Thursday morning and they sent him from urgent care to the hospital. He was admitted to the hospital and is still there now. Adverse events did not result in physician office visit; coughing and blood clots in the lungs resulted in emergency room visits; patient went to urgent care twice, second time was sent to emergency room via ambulance. Tests: They have been doing tests on him all day. They did an echocardiogram on the day of reporting (on 04Jun2021) and they are doing blood work on him. The wife does not know the results, she is a rehab facility a half a mile away. Treatment: They gave him some kind of shot. He doesn&#39;t give medication to himself. She has no idea, maybe something like Lovenox or something like that but she just doesn&#39;t know. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event coughing and blood clots in the lungs and included some kind of shot; therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event pneumonia and included antibiotic, Doxycycline. The outcome of the events was unknown. Causality assessment: The pharmacist (patient&#39;s wife) states she was highly suspect, as soon as they told him it was a blood clot in his lungs. Relatedness was assessed as related for all events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported serious events cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Some shortness of breath.  Patient saw me a few days later feeling like he was dying.  He was treated with steroids and vitamin C along with glutathione IV treatment.

My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

He sat in his car a few more minutes with his wife not feeling as if he was completely well.  He returned to the clinic reporting tightness in his neck and throat area.  His blood pressure was taken 189/99.  He did not have difficulty breathing or any other signs of anaphylaxis but was given 50mg of benadryl as a precaution.  We continued to monitor blood pressure for 30 minutes and did not resolve.  He has a history of high blood pressure but reports that it is controlled by taking Metoprolol and Amlodipine daily.  Physician was consulted and felt it was best to be seen in the ER.  The patient was transported to ER by his wife and seen.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                On Monday night, after the vaccination on Friday, about 10:00 I began to feel pain in my neck, both shoulders, and across my chest. Sleep was fitful and finally impossible, with every breath being painful. We went to ER about 6:00 A.M., thinking it was either a heart attack or COVID. I was checked very well, with good results. EKG was fine, Oxygen at 97%, chest x-ray looked good, white blood count was good, but platelets were low. A subsequent flu test and COVID test both came back negative. My symptoms were constant for several hours then diminished, increased, and diminished until Friday when I felt largely symptom free.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Patient received the vaccine around 10 am on 3-10-21. He mentioned to the vaccinator that he had a large anxiety of needles. After receiving the vaccine the patient went to the recovery area for the required 15 minutes. About 10 minutes later his breathing rapidly increased - eventually turning to large gasps of air. The patient then briefly passed out but then quickly woke up. He then started vomiting for the next 10 minutes. Eventually he recovered enough to walk with the help of his wife. The wife stated that he has had episodes like this from other vaccines and blood draws. He has never vomited from the episodes, however.

However, no one could explain after 70 years of no serious (flu) sickness that something suddenly caused my system to fail.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP7533), intramuscular administered in the right arm, on 06Apr2021 12:00, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a clinic. Medical history included dementia (frontotemporal dementia, behavior variant) from Jun2010 and ongoing, could not speak, hypothyroidism, prostate and urinary problems, and COVID-19 in Dec2020. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism from 2020 and ongoing; and morniflumate (FLOMAX tablet 4 mg) taken for prostate and urinary problems from an unspecified date (reported as 5 or more years) and ongoing. The patient did not have prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 06Apr2021 at 17:00, 5 hours after the vaccination, the patient experienced fever (103.2 degrees), lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair, needed help getting him in and out of bed, conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space, chills, and was so cold that his fingertips were blue. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. The reporter further explained that the patient experienced chills, fever, lost the lability to walk and needed a wheelchair, and needed help getting help in and out of bed. She stated he was unresponsive but clarified that he was conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space. The chills lasted for less than an hour. She put a heating blanket on him. She added that he was so cold that his fingertips were blue. The chills ended and he ran into a fever which lasted for 10 hours. She mentioned that if his fever would have been greater than 105 degrees, she would have sent him to the emergency room. The highest it reached was 103.2 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and cold compresses which brought his temperature down to 101. He was comfortable. Initially, on an unspecified date, his breathing, color and blood pressure were all good. While he had a fever, she observed that to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. From a cardiovascular view he is healthy. The local paramedics come and check on him periodically and the reporter monitors his glucose and blood pressure (unknown results). She stated that all of these were complicated by him having dementia. The reporter stated that he was getting better. She was not panicked and was not complaining. She wanted the officials to know that she thinks people who have had Covid should be tested to see the level of antibodies present or a titer test before having the vaccine and that maybe they not need the vaccine. The events did not require visits to emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The reporter assessed the events &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34;, &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34;, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34;, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; as serious (medically significant).

So fast forward to 8:30 am her husband was having difficulty breathing, and she called again and this time they had 7 paramedics come out to the house. She states that all of them were very nice. An EKG was performed because patient reported that he had a soft pain in his left side of his chest. She states that everything was cool with that, except his pulse rate was high. She states that he also had low blood oxygen level. She states that they strapped in her husband in and drove him to the hospital to the ER. At the ER they discovered that potassium level increased and she said that he had some extra fluid in his body. He was a dialyses patient so they gave him dialysis on Sunday evening. He had calmed down at that point and they were constantly taking blood from him. She found out about the COVID vaccine had potassium and phosphate as active ingredients and her husband shouldn&#39;t have that. She also informed that they had to give him a tranquilizer because he was having a panic attack during this whole episode. She says that they gave him alprazolam. Patient doesn&#39;t know exactly when the side effects went away because he didn&#39;t have a clock or a phone. Patient&#39;s wife also clarified that he vomited twice before going to the hospital but then he felt like he had to vomit afterwards but he did not. She stated that his breathing problems didn&#39;t stop when paramedics came and gave him oxygen. They made it to their house by 8:40 am, and he still had low oxygen level, they were still giving oxygen the whole time he was in the hospital. The patient was discharged on 13Apr2021. At the time of the reporting event outcome was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), at the age of 71 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breathlessness (which has been a bit of an issue for 6-8 months), subclinical airway disease, and inflammation in the airway; all are ongoing. The patient stopped smoking years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had the first dose of BNT162B2 on 14Feb2021 for COVID-19 Immunisation. The physician stated that he was a lung specialist and had a friend (patient) who got the Pfizer vaccine. The patient had the first dose on 14Feb2021 and the second dose on 01Mar2021. Shortly after the second dose, the patient had breathlessness, which has been a bit of an issue for 6-8 months he hadn&#39;t seen him with the pandemic, he got worse breathlessness on Mar2021. Stated that they both got vaccinated and he went to his house and the patient said to let himself in as he (patient) had shortness of breath and can&#39;t go up and down the stairs. The physician stated that he (physician) was his student but he was also the patient&#39;s lung specialist and he was treating him. The patient was then initially treated with Breo which was a combo drug that was good with airway disease. It was a product from GSK that was an inhaled steroid and long acting. It worked 72-96 hours and he was really trapping a lot of air and feeling it in his back musculature. Stated that the patient stopped taking it and mentioned that the patient was a guy and guys are sort of born stupid and he never called him and found out he was plateauing and not better. The patient was then started on Anoro which was 2 drugs in one an anticholinergic and a long acting sympathicsomatic and he was considerably better. The patient was still plagued with a cough, some from his upper airway and some from his lower airway in Mar2021. The physician said that he had to be careful with inhaled steroids because the patient does not want to weaken his vocal cords. The physician then stated what he thought happened was the vaccine changed the cellular airway phenotype and that happened since the patient was vaccinated with the second dose. Stated that the inflammation in the airway before the vaccine had changes qualitatively or quantitatively or both and what the vaccine does was recruit all sorts of inflammation and sorts and distributes it through the body. The physician was asking to get guidance with regards to pharmacology and even more complicated think beta 2 receptors polymorphism which means unlike him (the physician), who was asthmatic can reach for his rescue inhaler and get better if he needed to and the patient can&#39;t do that, he had to be on a category of medication reserved for emphysema or chronic bronchitis which he does not have. Stated he will formulate a question on what was the airway phenotype before the vaccine going on with it, in retrospect brewing for away and some tipping point was reached and something happened with the vaccine, which he felt was excellent in clinical. The physician stated that the immune response in the airway was a large response, stating that there were 1000 cell types and a million chemicals in that &#34;soup&#34;. The physician stated that he would like a call next week and talk to a Pfizer pulmonologist and get guidance and a little instruction the patient does not want to damage his airway. Stated 8/10 times the airway issue resolves with Breo and 2/10 times it doesn&#39;t. Stated that this situation got worse after vaccinated and paradoxically they got together after 6-8 months to see each other. Stated that the medication was Breo 100 and what was happening was the patient was trapping a lot of air and he measured his total lung volume and his chest was horribly over expanded. Stated that the patient&#39;s total lung volume on 18Mar2021 was 160% the predicted and that it was the equivalent of taking the normal lung volume, 4L and putting in another 2.5L and walking around with a chest that was hyperinflated and when the patient reaches to take a breath there was no room. The physician stated he has taken care of him and the patient &#34;plateaued&#34; and he needed to do something. The outcome of cough was not recovered, while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 71-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: PFIZER EL3248) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jan2021 at 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure and cervical spondylitis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient&#39;s allergies were not known. Patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: PFIZER 3756) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 01Jan2021 at 11:00. On 29Jan2021, at night (after seven days of vaccine), the patient experienced frequent nasal congestion and breathing problem and it was still continuing even after three weeks of vaccination. On 17Feb2021, the patient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 Semi-Quant Total Ab; test results showed SARS-CoV-2 Semi-Quant Total Ab greater than 250.00 Abnormal i.e. antibody level was abnormally very high (normal less than 0.8 U/ml). Patient wanted to know if patient&#39;s nasal congestion and breathing problem was due to abnormally very high level of antibody, developed after Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination and if so, how long it would continue and what measures/precaution/remedies patient could take to reduce side effects. On 17Feb2021, patient also mentioned that oxygen level in oximeter and chest ray were ok. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

COVID-19 Unknown, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Yes, Palliative care encounter Not Applicable, Declining functional status No. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY; Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission, Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was fine and nothing happened until after the vaccine. The patient took the 1st dose on 24Apr2021 and the next day he got very sick, they thought it was just a reaction from the vaccine, then he was swelling said he was not feeling well. The day after the vaccine, the patient was rushed to the emergency room and confined to the ICU. He felt unwell and it got worse and worse, we took his oxygen level and it was at 80%, he had swelling, difficulty breathing and tachycardia. The reporter thought it was an allergic reaction but this morning the patient tested positive for covid, he didn&#39;t go out the only time he went out was to get the vaccine. The reporter asked If he didn&#39;t know he had covid and got the vaccine, will he get more sick. In the report they found blood clots and the doctors thought it was from the vaccine. He was diagnosed with blood clots and difficulty breathing and he tested Covid-19 positive. Events seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                A few days after the second Covid shot I started having chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness after just  just walking or mild exercise . This persisted  fir a couple days until I went to a heart doctor  had PET test , went to heart hospital for angiogram and had a stint placed into LAD heart artery on March 29.  I am still having chest pains and shortness of breath. But not as severe as before the stint was put in artery.   Before I had the second Covid shot I could exercise hard with no ill effects.  After Covid shot I could barley  walk 50 yards without severe chest pains etc.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/ Lot number: On CDC vaccine record card reporter thinks Lot is EN6206, pretty sure but could be EV6206) (pending for clarification), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (reported as Monday) (at the age of 71-year-old) at around13:00-13:30, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in clinic. Patient had a history of COVID-19 virus around onset about the last day of Sep2020 or Oct2020.Down and out for about 14 days before totally turned it around (when he had COVID-19 virus they turned him away from his normal doctor and told him to go get tested on his own so the whole process was handled through emergency urgent care testing) and had a blood disorder, does get blood clotting. The patient had no relevant concomitant products or other medical conditions. Nothing relevant; he has just been taking the medicines he has always taken; mostly a lot of vitamins and stuff and he takes a full acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). Patient had his last blood work and testing done in Oct2020 when they gave him clearance, told him he was no longer positive for COVID-19 virus, no bloodwork taken since then. Patient had undergone height measurement and resulted as 5 feet, 9 inches, probably 5 feet, 8 inches because he shrunk getting older but thinks 5 feet, 9 inches. Patient had no exposure that he was aware of other than his own history of COVID-19. He went and asked if he should get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and was told yes because it was over 90 days since he was cleared of COVID-19. On 15Mar2021, patient had some issues with first shot. After his vaccine by the end of the day he felt like he was back having the COVID-19 virus all over again and had all the symptoms he had before, like weakness, shortness of breath and everything. He stated he was really got effected at the end of the evening but did not know until the following morning when he woke up and was soaking wet sweating and had a fever of 101. He slept the whole day and by the end of the second day he felt much better but still had a fever. He sweat that evening and the next morning felt good again. This all lasted a total of maybe 24 hours until he felt good again. He had something different after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that he did not have when he had COVID-19 virus which was his urine was a bright yellow color from 16Mar2021 to 17Mar2021. His urine looks normal again today (18Mar2021), but he did not have urine symptom when he had COVID-19 virus previously. Patient reported that he had the flu on an unspecified date. He asked because he is slated for the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 08Apr2021, he stated he knows the first shot was supposed to give him 50 percent immunity, he does not think he should go do it again, it makes him real nervous about the results he had from the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; asked if he should or should not get the second dose relative to these events. Everyone else said it was a piece of cake, but it wasn&#39;t for him. He was ok all day after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered 15Mar2021, felt pretty decent the rest of the day and evening. On 16Mar2021 his whole world changed, felt like he was back having the COVID-19 virus all over again starting 16Mar2021 he had exactly all the same things, feeling like he had before, that he experienced when he had COVID-19. He woke in the middle of the night with sweats, really hot-his wife took his body temperature, and his body temperature was 101; he slept most of the day on 16Mar2021. He had tiredness; headaches; chills; joints; fevers; the whole thing for about a 24 hour period until event finally subsided, clarified as improved the patient was started feeling a little better 16Mar2021, but he sweat like crazy that evening so that must have broken the fever. It was not until morning of 17Mar2021 that he felt functional. He still once in a while gets a little headache but that is minor. The only thing was on the second day after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered, after events onset, patient received a couple of Aspirin because his lower back was hurting, probably from sitting so long. The reporter assessed the events as non serious. The outcome of the events urine was a bright yellow color was recovered on 18Mar2021, lower back was hurting was unknown and the rest of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

At 3 o&#39;clock, he started throwing up, he had the dry hives for about 3 hours along with diarrhea. And then he had a temperature. He laid down and woke up just heavy sweat on the break down he meant big time.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

This continue for 3 - 4 days. No interruption of daily activities-- just that quiet ache. Heavier breathing upon exertion, but not interrupting routine. Though the aching is over, my breathing never fully recovered. I&#39;m not a medical professional-- but estimating I lost 15% ish of my breathing/capacity. This doesn&#39;t interfere with daily activities, but is &#34;present&#34; with me all the time. Even walking the dog requires a brief  slow down.

                                                Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor&#39;s meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer&#39;s reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided. The outcome was recovered on 04Feb2021 for the event &#34;sore left arm at injection site&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;shortness of breath&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;blood clot in right lung&#34;.

                                                Beginning the day after the inoculation, my husband began feeling worse in terms of his difficulty in breathing.  He used the  Albuterol inhaler more than usual.  It progressively got worse over the next 2 weeks, ending with my husband?s sudden collapse and death exactly 2 weeks later on April 5, 2021.  The inoculation may or may not have been directly linked to his unexpected death, but I feel it may have exasperated his condition, which led to his death.   And I feel it is important to report this to you.  I later heard that he should not have been using his Albuterol inhaler one week prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine.  I don?t know if that is true, but that information was never told to my husband, if it is.

A 72-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 04Feb2021 at 14:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hospitalized for pneumonia in Sep2020 and treated with &#34;mega-doses&#34; of prednisone, antibiotics (unspecified) and oxygen wherein he recovered, came off oxygen for 1.5 months, but then after Christmas 2020, went back on the oxygen, from 07Jan2021 through 12Jan2021 the patient was hospitalized again and CT scans and cultures were performed on his lungs which returned a diagnosis of MAC complex.  The patient is awaiting treatment for this after lung cultures mature. The patient also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing diagnosed 20 years ago, congestive heart failure (CHF), stomach issues, rash also on a portion of his face and eye sensitivity all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient also had a heart attack and a triple bypass in May2020 and ongoing diverticulitis that has been going on forever since an unknown date. The patient is taking &#34;a lot of other meds&#34; (unspecified) for heart, lungs and digestive things. The patient previously got a regular flu shot (unspecified) and got feverish, chills, achy and his arm hurts. After the patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021, that day and night he had no symptoms. On 05Feb2021, the patient developed an itchy, burning, rash everywhere but legs and feet that &#34;almost felt like shingles&#34;, which escalated over 5 days, tapered off a little on Wednesday, Thursday it was receding, by Friday 12Feb2021 it was basically gone.  The patient went to a dermatologist office and they did not know about the rash. He called his pulmonologist and they told him not to get the second dose due to his underlying conditions. He was in the hospital back in Jan2021 and they found something on his lung and he is now working with infectious disease people, they told him to see an allergist, he cancelled his appointment for the second dose. The patient wants to know if this rash is being reported and was hoping that maybe someone would have seen or heard of something like this. The patient also reported that he has a lessened sense of taste that started on an unspecified date, around Tuesday, and he has had some difficulty breathing during all of this as well, unsure if it is related to the vaccine or his underlying condition. The outcome of difficulty breathing and lesser sense of taste was not recovered. The outcome of the event almost felt like shingles was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                His body was beginning to shake; his whole body was aching, his back, everywhere, from his legs to his toes.  It was maybe in his muscles; Shortness of breath; Headache; Little fever; Whole body from his neck, back, toes, and arms went to aching all the way down; Nervous; Tired feeling; could not sleep from the pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This is a 72-years-old male consumer (patient) reported that he received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0164; expiry date 31Aug2021) on 17Apr2021 0920 for COVID-19 Immunization. He took an arm out of his sleeve and they asked him which arm. He said his right arm and they gave it in the muscle section. They did a couple taps and said he might feel a little pinch. Medical history included COVID-19 from 30Dec2020 (tested positive on 30Dec2020, It shuts the whole body down. He could not even get his bowels to move. His doctor said it was because Covid affects the whole body system.) and Covid pneumonia (it attacked his lungs. He was in the hospital for 2 days. He came out of it and the CDC guidelines said to wait 90 days before he got his first shot of the Covid vaccine), blood pressure, cyst, stomach problem, allergic to penicillin (He had a penicillin shot years ago and he broke out all over. His mom said not to take it. He had rashes all over his body.), glaucoma. Family history included diabetic. Before his mom and dad passed they were healthy. His dad was 92 and his mom was 90. Everything was good. His mom was diabetic, and his dad was perfectly healthy. Other medical condition included with his lungs he has something they call psychodosis or something like that. He is going through a lot of problems with his stomach. They did tests and X-rays and different things to see what was going on inside his stomach and chest. It has been years, he has had the lung problems for awhile. He has shortness of breath and something with his thyroid or lymph nodes. That has been for a while.  He had X-rays and a CT back in January when he was in the hospital. Those were on the 12th and were of his chest. They took the X-rays on the 13th. He had 2 to 3 chest x-rays and one CT. The last chest X-ray he had was in February to see how the pneumonia was doing. His doctor said it was looking better and to just move slower and take things easy. Past drugs included blood pressure pills (propazol or something like that). All of this started with whatever happened to his body after he had Covid-lung problems and everything. He was told to keep taking whatever medications he was on. He was not on any antibiotics or anything. They gave him antibiotics for a cyst he had, but he did not take those. They were too strong, and he stopped those about 2 to 3 weeks before he had the shot. He only took 3. The patient had tried feeling, headache, little fever, nervous, shortness of breath, Whole body from neck, back, toes, and arms went to aching all the way down on 17Apr2021. The shortness of breath started between 1300 and 1330. The pain was before everything else starting between 1600 and 1700. The headaches and stuff got him up at 0200 to 0300 and then he could not sleep from the pain. Everything else comes and goes but the pain was the longest. He sat for close to 40 minutes after the shot because he did not want to leave early. He was tired because he had to do the Covid test walk. He had the Covid test which was negative. Then he had to do a walk at about 1330 to determine if he should still be on oxygen. He had been on oxygen for about 2 to 3 months as he previously had Covid pneumonia. He had dropped his level to 91 when they put him in the hospital. Everything was better now. It was a little better once he came back home. It was because he had to do a 6 minute walk. He had a tired feeling because 6 minutes after the shot they had to determine if he still needed oxygen or not.  He told the tech he just had the shot and asked if he should do the test. They said he had to do it.  They sat him down and were checking his heart rate and oxygen level.  He also had a headache and a little fever. Later that afternoon he came home at about 1600 to 1700. He was okay all that day and ate a little and got ready for bed. Once he laid in bed his whole body from his neck, back, toes, and arms went to aching all the way down. He thought it had to be this shot. He took Tylenol and tried to lay down. 0300 that morning he thought he might have to go to emergency. The paper said those are some of the side effects that he would probably experience. He got up and got nervous like he was getting ready to shake a bit and started walking. The pain was still there in his body. He tried to be calm and not panic. He took another Tylenol. He could not lay flat. He had to push his bed up to the wall and put a pillow on his back and the back of his neck to sleep straight up. Sunday morning things got a little better and he went out. He came back in at about 1200. Between 1400 to 1500 his symptoms came back. He thought he should go to emergency, but he did not go and waited. He took another Tylenol. It was between 1500 and 1600 that it all cleared up. It had to be from the shot. He did not get any pain when they gave him the shot, he had no pain in his arm. Then something broke loose and his whole body was aching, his back, everywhere, from his legs to his toes.  It was maybe in his muscles. He talked to a lot of people and his neighbors who had it and they felt nothing. Another lady said after she had it she only had one hour of sleep and could not sleep from it either. The same thing happened to him. The headache did not last long. He took Tylenol for it. The only thing that lasted long was the body aches. He held off going to the emergency and it cleared up. He was going to go to the emergency Monday morning. The aches were gone now. The only pain now was one that he had all the time before that. This was altogether different because his body ached all the way down his back, arms, hands, legs, feet, toes, everything. The fever went away the same day. Only the pain lasted long. Even the nervousness went away. His body was beginning to shake. All of this was probably created from the vaccine. They said if he experienced pain to take Tylenol. He was taking these before he had the shot. All he can see on the bottle is 30047112. His kids brought this to him back in February of this year when he had Covid. Lot: SLA065, expiration date: Aug2024. They are 500mg, 100 count. The seals were not broken or anything, he always checks that out before he takes it. He checks everything out to see if anything is damaged. Outcome of the events tired, headache, fever, nervous was recovered on 17Apr2021, event whole body aching was recovered on 18Apr2021. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

He started to have intermittent intermittent fevers,  shortness of breath and labored breathing. Wife reported he would  &#34;get sweaty and hot &#34; and therefore she would give him tylenol. He saw his pcp 2 days later  on 4/7/21 for these symptoms. In addition she noticed him to present with decline in his cognition and hemibody weakness and swelling.   His pcp was also concerned about diastolic dysfunction. He received an outpatient ECHO.  He was placed on lasix and referred to cardiology. On 4/19 He saw cardiology who ordered EKG and reviewed his echo. Felt that his afib was likely contributing to his shortness of breath. His echo and recent blood work revealed preserved EF. He had occasional scattered wheezes on exam and therefore inhaler and cxr was ordered.      On 4/22 he presented to the Emergency room for breakthrough seizure.  Breakthrough seizure lasted longer than usual (20 minutes), so ED performed a CT head, which showed an age indeterminant lacunar infarct in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. ( new from MRI 2 months earlierI) .

Medical history included hypertension, tachycardia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 02May2021, the patient was complaining of feeling unwell since receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. Caller states father has been having flu-like symptoms. His oxygen saturation was low and he was having difficulty breathing. He was experiencing a rapid heart rate and currently was being tested for Covid 19, he was having chest ray done, and blood work. his heart rate was like 140 and then his oxygen would go down to 80. Caller states she didn&#39;t know if Pfizer has ever heard of symptoms like that. Caller states she just wanted to know what was going on, he&#39;s in the hospital now. The patient had tachycardia, fast heart beat. Caller states he is 72 years old, he was just laying down and felt his heart really bad, they used a monitor and his heart rate was 140, it was super elevated. Caller states they used the oxygen thing that they put on his finger and the oxygen levels were 80 so it was really low. Caller states he was completely fine, he never went out of the house, he was completely fine, normal. Caller states he does have hypertension though and he drinks medicine for that but she doesn&#39;t know which medicine it is. Caller states the first day they applied the vaccine, he felt good.

Caller verifies it was an injection in his arm, but doesn&#39;t know which arm. Caller also unsure of dosage given. Caller states they were like no only Pfizer, so he waited so long for Pfizer and finally when he applied to Pfizer and got it, he was so happy and so now he&#39;s so sad because he feels bad. Caller requesting to be transferred to the medical staff at this time. Caller states she doesn&#39;t have time to finish the report for her father or herself because her lunch break is almost over.

A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 16Apr2021 10:00 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot years ago, ongoing leukemia (in remission), coma, gout (he takes a gout medicine), neuropathic pain, pain, high blood pressure, thyroid (disorder), varicose veins and uses rollator (his wheelchair with a seat). Concomitant medications included metoprolol taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (THYROXINE) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; hydrocodone taken for pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; imatinib taken for leukemia in remission from an unspecified start date and ongoing; gabapentin taken for neuropathic pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; folic acid (FOLATE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and ongoing unspecified gout medicine. The patient previously took morphine; he had a shot of morphine in the emergency room sometime before his COVID vaccine. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 25Mar2021 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility was PRIVACY she thinks. Prior vaccination (4 weeks prior) were none. The patient&#39;s sister reported that they both had their second dose and she forgot to tell the other woman she spoke to about herself because the caller&#39;s focus was on her elderly brother who was 72-years-old. They both received their COVID vaccines in the morning of 16Apr2021, a Friday, and within hours her brother felt very bad. She went downstairs and saw her brother vomiting in the trash can and he just said that he hurt and that he felt nauseated. This continued for a few days, in fact it continued for 4 days. He was beginning to feel better on Monday, but he was still not up to par. Then Tuesday she guesses her brother was feeling better. On Wednesday night she went downstairs and heard him around 2300 to midnight talking to the dogs and then the next morning she found him unresponsive (22Apr2021). Her first thought was that maybe her brother had a stroke so she called 911. In the emergency room he had a CAT (computerized tomography) scan and at first they said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. But something very unusual was that her brother had a rapid heartbeat and his normal was around 60 but in the emergency room his heartrate was upwards to 120 to 130 to 140. He was then transferred to another hospital where they said the next evening that in fact he did have a stroke even though that first doctor said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. The doctor didn&#39;t find any further information until 2 days later when the doctor thought her brother already had some blood clots that were thrown into the frontal, temporal and parietal region in his brain. She was a biologist so she can&#39;t say that the COVID vaccine caused this but she thought that Pfizer should be aware of his situation and then she was so focused on her brother that she forgot to tell the other woman the really bizarre things. She had asked certain questions to the doctor based on what her sister was telling her to ask. The caller asked the doctor if her brother was going to be seen by a neurologist and the doctor gave a rambling evasive answer and then turned on his heels and walked out and kicked her out of the hospital. They both had their COVID vaccines in the morning around 1000 or so and she doesn&#39;t know if he was vomiting still the next day or not but her brother felt really bad. He has chronic conditions and he generally just felt bad and he had thought that something was wrong with him. He felt malaise, fatigue, his head hurt and he was nauseated. He ate one bowl of soup that the caller had made for him but he wasn&#39;t really eating. That lasted for about 4 days and then he started to feel better on Tuesday, confirmed to 20Apr2021, and then he felt even better on Wednesday, confirmed to 21Apr2021, because the caller did take him on some trips. He doesn&#39;t drive. Her brother said that he felt feverish and the caller says that he felt feverish to the touch as well but the thermometer said that he didn&#39;t have a fever because it had an error sign when she took his temperature. Unresponsive: Her brother was fine Wednesday night around 2300, maybe midnight, she had heard him downstairs talking to the dogs and she knew that he was okay. Then the next morning, 22Apr2021, she found him slumped into his rollator (his wheelchair with a seat) and he was slumped over and had stuff that looked like had came out of his mouth and he had vomit on legs. He was unresponsive so she called 911 and said that she thought her brother had a stroke. The operator said to lay him flat and the caller was finally able to get him up and then his arm got hung up and the operator said again to get her brother on the floor and get him flat. She understands that this was important and she was able to do it but they all fell down, her brother, her and the rollator. Shortly after this the ambulance had shown up. The ambulance took her brother to the emergency room in town and they said that her brother&#39;s heartrate was fast. She gave them all of the relevant information but she didn&#39;t think to tell them about the COVID vaccine. They said that her brother&#39;s heart was acting eradicate and it was very fast. Again, his normal heartrate is in the 60s and it was going from 110 to 140s and it wasn&#39;t coming down. She told them that when he was unresponsive that she thought he was having agonal breathing. In the emergency room, her brother&#39;s breathing was still not very good and she heard the doctor say that her brother had stopped breathing but then he came back so that&#39;s when he was intubated in the emergency room. They did a CAT scan of his head and his neck and the doctor comes back and said that her brother didn&#39;t have a stroke. But that was not the case according to a different doctor&#39;s later assessment. Approximately around 1430 to 1445 on that Thursday, 22Apr2021, they transferred him to PRIVACY,  where he was in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). His heartrate conditioned to being very fast. He went from the emergency room to the ICU. Thursday when he got transferred to the ICU they didn&#39;t do any diagnostic tests that day, he was still intubated and his heartrate was still up into the next day, Friday, 23Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t until late in the afternoon that a doctor came in and said that her brother did have a stroke he has even had prior strokes too. They had done an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) on Friday of his brain, which was not what they did in the first emergency room, that showed that he had a stroke in his temporal, frontal and parietal regions of his brain. At first caller states that on Saturday, he opened his eyes but he was still unresponsive essentially but then she says that this statement was wrong because he actually didn&#39;t respond that quickly. He has gone into a coma once before and when he had came out of it a very unpleasant thing happened that was very personal so she was not going to tell it. On Saturday and Sunday the doctor didn&#39;t want to answer the callers questions, this was a different doctor than the first ICU doctor and this one didn&#39;t have good bedside manner. Finally on Monday, 26Apr2021, her brother started responding. He was moving his legs with purpose, he had tried to kick the nurse, and he had made some words. The day before this, on Sunday the caller had brought the priest in to bless her brother and he sort of nodded and he seemed to make movements but he was still not able to talk. Monday he said what sounded like words and then Tuesday he made, what seemed to her like, meaningful statements. She was told that he had an ultrasound of his neck to see if he had any clogged arteries or veins and the nurse said that the test results came back good that their were no clogs. But this was where the whole story just becomes awful. Caller discusses how there were issues with a cousin having power of attorney from 2015 that was supposedly no longer valid according to the caller and she had spoke with administration and then she got kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday because of a question she had asked the doctor about her brother seeing a neurologist. The doctor said that the neurologist makes his own schedule and it might be 10 days or more if he even decided he wanted to see her brother. When the doctor asked the caller how would she like her brother&#39;s care to be she mentioned that he was in a coma before and was being treated for similar circumstances from PRIVACY and that he was seen by a neurologist and she said that maybe her brother should be seen by PRIVACY and the doctor walked out and within minutes she was being escorted out of the hospital for belittling the doctor and calling administration. Now they won&#39;t even let flowers be delivered to her brother. Unfortunately the person who has been involved with him the most, the caller, was now barred from him. She was not saying that this was all due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why were they saying that she has a blood clot too. She has had headaches but they may be due to stress. She didn&#39;t feel sick like her brother. She has a question and she was really scared about the answer. She was just now reading that if you&#39;re on immunosuppressant drugs then you&#39;re not supposed to have the COVID vaccine. She asked was that true. Well her brother was in remission for leukemia and he was on a cancer medication called imatinib. Caller declined to speak to medical information about this and says it was already too late because he was already taking it and she doesn&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t stop them. Her brother&#39;s friends have tried to call and they were all getting the same statement, which she believes the hospital was stone walling, but the hospital says that they don&#39;t have a patient by his name and they have even told the florist the same thing. So caller was unsure if her brother has been discharged or not. He didn&#39;t seem to be in the shape to be shipped to a care facility but she doesn&#39;t know. It was hard for her to piece it all together. The hospital wasn&#39;t feeding her brother enough before she left so for all she knows they could be starving him to death and holding nutrition from him. History/ Investigations: His medications were ones that he has been taking for years and she doesn&#39;t know exact start dates for any and if she needs to she can get the dosage information from the pharmacy. Her brother has hid his pills before and he puts them in different bottles, it was a nightmare. He takes a gout medicine and she doesn&#39;t know the name of it. Those were the main ones that he takes other than the cancer medicine she said earlier. And he also takes gabapentin for some of his neuropathic pain and he takes something at night and a few others she thinks. For medical conditions the only thing that she knows was that many years ago he had a blood clot but she can&#39;t really say what year it was. She does know that her brother wasn&#39;t on any blood thinners to he knowledge and not long ago he had an ultrasound of his legs to determine if he had a blood clot but she was not 100 % sure if he had that but she thinks he did. Her brother told her that years ago he had blood clots that were due to weight lifting causing varicose veins and later they collateralized and they found out that the other secondary vessels took over for pumping his blood so it wasn&#39;t a problem. Her concern was can someone from Pfizer talk to her about what&#39;s going on with her brother, she knows Pfizer doesn&#39;t have his records but how will Pfizer be able to determine if this was from the COVID vaccine. She guesses that she was curious about what may of caused the blood clots. She mentioned the COVID vaccine to one doctor and he didn&#39;t seem like she respected her knowledge. She asked was there anything that can be done to help her brother if it was a blood clot. She was upset that the hospital and her wanting her brother to see a neurologist and beginning with a claim that he didn&#39;t have a stroke and then a claim that he did. She thinks that they were not doing enough for her brother and they were just saying oh well, it was all due to a fast heart rate which can happen as a result of the COVID vaccine. She was going to be honest, she was exhausted and she can&#39;t keep talking for a long time. She asked if she can call medical information back later when she was more refreshed. Consumer further stated that her brother had complaints of feeling ill, feverish and having no appetite. Caller stated that the next Thursday she found her brother unconscious, heart rate was elevated 120 to140 beats per minute and that her brother had a stroke. The outcome was recovered on 21Apr2021 for the events Malaise, Nauseated, Fatigue, Headache and Appetite absent; recovering for the event Vomiting; and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. About 8 days after the first dose in Jan2021, the patient started noticing gradually being short of breath. He would walk for 50 yards and he would be huffing and puffing which is unusual because he can walk a lot.  It gradually got worse. Outcome of the event was not recovered. Patient received his second dose on 10Feb2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

A 72-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection), via an unspecified route on 23Mar2021 at 12:30, last night or 1:00 (age at vaccination: 72-year-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, allergic to iodine and had covid in Feb2019. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Past drug history included inhaler (antihistaminic) for 3 times a day for 4 days, when he had Covid in 2019. He said it seems like it was on the cuff of being a threat to his life. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection), via an unspecified route on 02Mar2021 as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. On 23Mar2021, patient experienced an allergic reaction after getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine. He mentioned that he experienced extreme difficulty breathing and he had chills, headache and really started aching but he couldn&#39;t breathe. He was wondering if he was going to die but he does not panic when he can&#39;t breathe because he has asthma but last night he was concerned. He had to take slow deep breaths through nose to survive it, but it wasn&#39;t working, and he wasn&#39;t getting enough air, but he fell asleep, and he got through it. He said the pharmacist said that people that who have had Covid have a harder reaction to the shot. He was struggling last night, and it was hard to breathe. He mentioned that his daughter, who is 47, and her family all got Covid infection, and she is having trouble breathing still, she can&#39;t even finish a sentence. He was wondering if this was something that ran in the family. He stated he is supposed to keep Benadryl with him, but it knocks him out and he was afraid if he went to sleep, he wouldn&#39;t wake up. He asked if this reaction was normal or if it was an allergic reaction. Therapeutic treatment taken as a result of the events included two antihistamines (ChlorTab 4 mg each), two Advil, and 2 shots of his albuterol inhaler and started coming around. The clinical outcome of aches and headache were not as bad and breathing is okay now, outcome of chills and allergic reaction was unknown.   Follow-up (24Mar2021): New information received from a contactable consumer included: dates of 1st and 2nd dose of vaccination added, events added, therapeutic medications updated and medical history updated.  No follow-up attempts are possible; Information about lot/batch number cannot been obtained.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Feb2021 (about 9:20AM-9:30AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unspecified date at 73-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had his second COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday, 21Feb2021 and had a significant reaction. Last night (21Feb2021), about 12 hours later, he started getting a headache, he was breathing really fast, and shivering. He tried to calm himself down and went to bed. This morning (22Feb2021) he got up around 7AM and still wasn&#39;t feeling too well. His temperature was slightly elevated at 98.9 on 22Feb2021. His normal temperature is 97.1. He knows his own body and was pretty convinced his reaction was from a slightly elevated temperature and everything that comes with that. He went back to bed this morning and slept until 11:30AM. He got up and felt good. He took his temperature a few minutes ago and it was back to 97.1. The outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and safety profile of the product, the contributory role of the suspect product  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), to reported events cannot totally be excluded.

                                                Fluid overload; shortness of breath; Graft clotted off; This is a spontaneous report from the Pfizer sponsored program. A contactable Nurse reported that a 73-year-old male patient (husband) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration, on Right Arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes, ongoing Vascular problems, ongoing Congestive heart failure; all (At least 15 years ago), blood thinners, dialysis from Sep2020 (husband has been on Dialysis since Sep2020. last time he was dialyzed was 11Feb2021) and Allergic to seafood and nuts. Concomitant medication(s) included clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) for blood thinner and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) for blood thinner. The patient experienced fluid overload and shortness of breath on an unspecified date, graft clotted off on 13Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized for fluid overload from 16Feb2021 to an unknown date. She stated that her husband is on dialysis in the hospital and is going to miss the second dose appointment for the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. She wanted to know what to do about the second dose. She wanted to know how long a person has to be off steroids before getting the vaccine and if she can reschedule the second dose appointment as he was hospitalized. Her husband is allergic to seafood and nuts. His appointment is at 10:30 (On 17Feb2021). She reported that he is on dialysis and his graft clotted and he has not had any dialysis in about a week. Her husband had fluid overload and shortness of breath. She said that he had to have an emergency port put in and they dialyzed him in the ER. He typically goes Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday. She said that he had not been dialyzed in over a week and he was getting fluid overload. She said that the last time he was dialyzed was 11Feb2021. She clarified that her husband has been on Dialysis since Sep2020. She said that when he got his Covid vaccine they checked that he was on Plavix and Aspirin. She said that they are supposed to hold the site because he has the tendency to bleed more while on blood thinners, but she does not know if that was the reason. She said that she knows what it was and he had to be dialyzed because of the fluid, but she was not told that her husband had fluid overload by the physician. She said that her husband has congestive heart failure as well. The patient was hospitalized due to Fluid overload from 16Feb2021 to ongoing. Outcome of all events was unknown and for remaining event Graft clotted off was not recovered. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal assosciation between the suspect, BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the events, fluid overload, graft clotted, shortness of breath is unrelated. The impact of this report on benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

He spoke with his PCP and was told to quarantine and report any worsening symptoms. Wednesday or Thursday he began with vomiting and unable to hold down any fluids. His cough was nonproductive. On Saturday 4/17/21 he reported to Hospital ER with SOB, cough, vomiting &amp; diarrhea. He was diagnosed with COVID PNA. He passed away 5/7/21 of COVID PNA, respiratory failure. He tested positive the week of 5/7/21 again of COVID 19. I feel this needs to be reported as he had both PFIZER vaccines in January &amp; February and still ended up intubated and deceased from COVID 19.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

Beginning on the evening of 1/29/21 I began experiencing Chills, a slight fever of 100.3 and extreme fatigue. These conditions continued for a period of 3 days.  At that point I also began to experience shortness of breath and my O2 level dropped to 78%.  I began using a nebulizer, spirometer,  flutter valve and exercises at that point and over the next several days.  Please note that I am a COPD patient and had completed a 16 day course of Prednisone on 1/25/21.  On approximately 2/6/21 my breathing and O2 levels began to return towards normal, although even today I&#39;m still not quite back to what&#39;s normal for me.  I am continuing to use the nebulizer, spirometer and flutter value in preparation for shot #2 scheduled for 2/18/21.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                My father complained of heartburn the evening he received his vaccine.  He told my mother he need to sit  down and relax.  My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

A 74-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration at right shoulder on 27Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.   The patient concomitant medications includes, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN CR 12.5mg) still ongoing for insomnia, taking it from years as patient comes from family of insomniacs &amp; high-pressure jobs; triazolam (HALCION) (0.25mg) still ongoing for sleep, rivaroxaban (XARELTO) (20mg) started taking in 2012 for pulmonary embolism &amp; has been on blood thinners, aspirin acetylsalicylic acid (low dose aspirin of 65mg) for supplemental blood thinner still ongoing. Patient has history of seasonal allergies and its prime time right now so its compounding. Relevant medical history includes, both knee replacement, pulmonary embolism, bad blood pressure problems maybe 5 years ago all on an unspecified date. The patient historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EN6198), at Right shoulder on 06Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  On 27Mar2021, When the patient got home from his shot, he had no problems at all and he went to bed. Being an old guy, he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and he lost his balance and took a nasty fall, so has a bummed up knee and stuff too, so that is what aggravates it. He clarifies he has a bum knee and nose after having the fall. Since he took the fall and has the bum knee, it is kind of a chore going up and down stairs.  On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced general sense of weakness , general tiredness. It has been over a week and he wants to know if that is unusual. Patient adds there was kind of a brain fog thing From: 28 Mar 2021  going on. The brain fog concerns him because he has to get his taxes done. He was still having trouble with the nose bleeds, which sort of compounds his misery, but he is getting better. It seems the side effects are getting incrementally better every day, but its not like he wakes up and its completely gone. It&#39;s like some prolonged illness. His side effects are getting marginally better. He is fairly clear headed today and he even had the nerve to take a short drive to the supermarket and stuff, although he wouldn&#39;t want to drive cross country in terms of being able to concentrate. But doing his taxes, will take a little work. Patient stated in the beginning he had muscle aches and chills from: 28Mar2021, but that went away after a day or two. Patient stated he had muscle aches/chills for a couple of days. He feels he has recovered completely as far as he knows. He never had nausea. On an Unspecified date patient mentions feeling a little short of breath, but states that could be more of the asthma thing. He does not recall having injection site pain at all. The tiredness is definitely ongoing, but has improved. He clarifies it has probably improved incrementally but doesn&#39;t really want to classify it as improvement because it might be temporary. He did not have a headache until he was waiting on the phone to speak to this call handler. On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced muscle pain for a few days and that sort of cleared up. This was the same with joint pain. After the big bang, clarified as the fall, everything proceeded. He still feels the muscle and joint pain, only in his knee, but its starting to fade. His knee was really a beautiful shade of purple, but it seems to be fading and hurting less so that is recovering, too. This pain is secondary. The side effect was the dizziness, stiffness, and inability to keep his balance. Caller states he was stiff as a board and he just couldn&#39;t move fast enough to get one foot in front of the other, and he landed on his knee, so the pain in his knee was not directly caused by shot. He felt fine at the center where he took the shot. He had to wait 15-20 minutes after the shot. He felt fine, drove home, went to bed, and in the middle of the night, it all started. He still feels a little dizzy and unsure and has been using a cane. He got both knees replaced and is worried that he damaged the actual replacement joint as opposed to just the muscle tissue. He just doesn&#39;t trust himself without the cane. He hasn&#39;t fallen over and hasn&#39;t passed out. He feels stiff all over but that could be from not getting to the gym and working out and not doing his regular work outs. Patient stated that the lethargy might be slightly better. He was making himself do more but he still gets really tired and it was really hard for him to get motivated, like to get out of the chair and go downstairs. He went to the supermarket and had to unload his car in stages- he took the perishables out and rested for a while and then went back out and got another couple of bags and then rested again. He just could not work straight through like he normally does. States he is in pretty good shape normally. He does not feel particularly great and that is the reason that he called to find out if this should last this long. Patient stated that he does have high blood pressure and heart problems. In fact at the end of the month, he will be going in for a catherization with Dr. (Name) so that was another reason he wants to have this stuff cleared up and out of the way. He still has dizziness and weakness. Patient stated that last night was the first night of decent sleep he had got. He has insomnia actually and he takes two sleep medications, but even taking those and washing it down with a glass of wine, he could not sleep for a whole week. He clarifies even with the Halcion and Ambien CR, it didn&#39;t work for a whole week- he could not sleep which adds to the brain fog. Typically, he goes to sleep, wakes up after a couple of hours, and then he is awake so he reads for a few hours and then takes the second medication and then sleep the rest of the night. He ends up getting a full 8-9 hours of sleep normally and he did that last night.   On 08Apr2021 he developed a pounding headache but it was probably independent of the shot. He took Tylenol and he is okay now, but he just thought it was ironic that he had one while waiting to talk to Pfizer when he hadn&#39;t had one before. Outcome of the events muscle pain and joint pain, dizziness and stiffness, Feeling unwell were ongoing and those of other events were unspecified.  No further information was provided or obtained

                                                problems breathing; allergic reaction; rash on the left ankle; hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened; hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened; his vision since the shots was compromised/vision in the lower section had shrunk even more/gotten worse; he moved things, but couldn&#39;t remember where he moved them; residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right upper arm on 04Mar2021 at 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6199) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at the military facility. He previously received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number: EN9581) on 11Feb2021 at 2-3 pm (at the age of 74 years old) in the right upper arm and experienced a bout of diarrhea, but he took loperamide (IMODIUM) and it went away; he expected the first shot and last only about a day. Relevant medical history included ongoing legally blind, wherein his central vision was screwed up and this was something going on before the shots and with his peripheral vision, there were areas he could see clearly, and also had eye pain; his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, which was ongoing; and residual neuropathy in feet; all from an unknown date prior the vaccine. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient previously took clonazepam (KLONOPIN) from an unspecified date in 2009; further reported that the patient had no information on this medication other than it was Klonopin that caused him to stop breathing and put in coma in 2009 and that he was given intravenous (IV) antibiotics, because he had 3 major infections and this was when the issue with his vision started. The patient previously received and stopped getting the flu shot years prior reporting when he got sick for 6 weeks. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) other than the first dose. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). The patient reported that he got the second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and within 5 minutes, he had a severe reaction. He was in an observation area at the facility and less than 5 minutes after getting the shot, he had problems breathing on 04Mar2021, it was painful to breath; however, it was further reported that &#34;painful&#34; was not the word for the problems breathing. The triage team gave him shots and he went to the emergency room (ER) and ended up spending the night in the hospital. It was further reported that they gave him an epinephrine (EpiPen) and some other shot in the left arm and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) in the right arm and put on oxygen on him. He was admitted to the hospital and released the next day. He was given the option to leave the next day and so he did. The doctor explained, they were concerned it was cardiac related, but did blood work and told them he was fine on an unspecified date in 2021. The doctor also told him they saw a rash on the left ankle on 04Mar2021 and therefore knew it was an allergic reaction. The rash on ankle was barely visible the next day, it had resolved though, but was not sure of the exact date. He couldn&#39;t have seen it anyway. There had also been other issues since then. He remarked that he moved things, but couldn&#39;t remember where he moved them on an unspecified date in 2021. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened. Regarding the patient&#39;s hearing, he explained that while in church, they were playing music and it was pure pain. He went to the clinic and saw an otolaryngologist, who told him that his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, not all though. He stated he had this before, but never with music at the church or like this. He was in the car and a car beside him with heavy base playing was giving him issues; the same kind of the pain, but on the opposite end with base. This was something new and not like he had before. It was ongoing and he had not gone back to church, so as not to experience this again. This started within a week or 2 after the second shot. Since the shots on an unspecified date in Mar2021, his vision was compromised. There were upper and lower areas, &#34;sweet spots,&#34; he could see. With his last check up, the vision in the lower section had shrunk even more; where he could see from about the 3:30 to 8:30 area before, currently it was from 5:00 to 7:00. He explained this was like on a clock. Also he was able to see the big E at the top of a vision chart, but in Mar2021 after the second shot, he noticed within days, he could no longer see the large E. He had a regularly schedule appointment a couple weeks after the second shot and this was noticed. It had gotten worse. Additionally, he would stand in front of the eye chart and as part of the eye exam, they would hold out fingers to see if he could see them. Last year at 6 feet (ft), he could see them, but currently, he couldn&#39;t see them until 2 ft away. If he was in bright light, he had severe eye pain, to the point of crying. He had to leave and get out of that situation, it was so bad. Even going outside with a hat and sunglass without looking at bright light, it still impacted him. The lighting in his bathroom bothered him; he had to have the blinds closed and was home bound. His closet was the only way to get relief. This was all new since the Covid shot. On an unspecified date in 2021, the residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened. He had this previously, but currently had hypersensitive in his feet in those areas. The patient found some essential oils that help so he could get to sleep and keep it from itching in his feet. The patient was deducting that for whatever reason, it was impacting nerve areas that had issues previously. It was causing them to get worse. He could only find this commonality; the optic, auditory, and residual neuropathy, the shot was aggravating these things that he already had problems with previously. It was added that he had also noticed his eyes had a throbbing pain, like a feeling of wanting to explode. He has had this in the past, but not too often and currently, it was daily and it was getting worse. It started about 3 weeks after, but it didn&#39;t happen often at first. Currently, it was almost daily. The doctor told him that there was not a way this could happen, there was no evidence this could happen. There had been no treatment, nothing had been done. He said with his DNA, if something could go wrong even just 1% then it would happen to him. The AE &#34;problems breathing&#34; did require an ER visit. The patient was hospitalized for the event problems breathing from 04Mar2021 to 05Mar2021. The patient underwent further lab tests and procedures, which included hearing test with unknown results on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of problems breathing, allergic reaction, and rash on the left ankle. The patient recovered from the event &#34;problems breathing&#34; on 04Mar2021; he recovered from the events &#34;allergic reaction and rash on the left ankle&#34; on an unspecified date in 2021; he was not recovered from the events &#34;residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened, hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened, and his vision since the shots was compromised/vision in the lower section had shrunk even more/gotten worse,&#34; while the outcome of the other event was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:10 AM  (at the age of 75 years), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney transplant. Concomitant medication included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MYCOPHENOLATE), prednisone. Historical vaccine included Dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982), on 14Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization). On 05Feb2021 at around 18:00 PM, the patient had what he believed was an anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest (he clarified that upper chest as where the neck meets the chest. It may have been a little lower, but not that far down that he would have worried. It was the upper chest where the neck meets the chest. Not in the chest to the left or right). It lasted intermittently for 4 days. He reported that it was not continuous, it would come for 2-3 hours dissipate and then come again. It wasn&#39;t all day and all night. He reported &#34;I&#39;m better now&#34;. The clinical outcome of anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest  was recovered on 10Feb2021.

                                                I had sudden malaise, lost consciousness and my wife says was not breathing briefly. I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.

                                                Patient was a healthy 75 year old male when he got the shot.  Within  5 hours, he began to feel TIRED, which was an expected side effect. He felt tired for several days. Nine days later he went to Memorial Hermann ER in Kingwood, and they said he had pneumonia. They also said he had a &#34;small mass&#34; at the bottom of his lung and might want to get it checked out. On March 20, he developed a cough. On March 21 we went to a different ER and a CT scan showed he had plureal effusion.  On the next day he was short winded. He went back to the ER and they admitted him and transferred him to hospital by ambulance.  On March 23, 1.7 liters of fluid was drained from his lung and sent to be tested. On March 26 he was diagnosed with malignant plureal effusion. He passed out at the doctor office and tranferred to to another facility by ambulance. He remained there for 4 days for tests, and a port was put in to drain the fluid. On March 29 he was transferred .  They repeated many tests and did a bronchoscopy.  On April 1 they told him he had squamous cell carcinoma.  He came home on April 2. The doctor called and said they made a mistake he had small cell carcinoma.  He remained home until April 11, when he was taken back to  by ambulance.  He had gone from a healthy appearing individual on March 17 to a critically ill individual and he died on April 15.  Doctors had never seen cancer overtake a man in 28 days. 28 days!!!!  On March 22, he had a small mass at the bottom of his lung, and one week later, it was a mass so large, his lung could not be seen and his lung had collapsed.  Doctors assumed that the cancer was dormant and that the vaccine did something to wake it. It attacked my husband with a vengeance.  He never smoked.

This 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EM9810) at single dose in left arm on 19Feb2021 11:00 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 28Jan2021 (Lot#: EL9261) at noon in left arm. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect was no. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. Ongoing medical history included controlled high blood pressure diagnosed around 2000; heart beat irregularities, diagnosed in his 20s, in 1971, he had his first EKG at that time. Concomitant medication was not reported. On 10Apr2021, patient experienced chest pain, shoulder pain, shortness of breath and ended up in the hospital. Temperature was 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit on 10Apr2021. It took a while to find out what was wrong, it was pericarditis, an inflammation and probably a viral infection of the pericardium. Patient was hospitalized on 10Apr2021, in the evening and discharged in the middle of the afternoon the next day, 11Apr22021, less than one day. The chest pain ended on 12Apr2021, but he had a relapse, and it was ongoing and persisting. Shoulder pain basically lasted for 24 hours. He was put on medicine and it got better, but he had a relapse last week and it was persisting. Shortness of breath had a relapse last week. When he was put on medicine, he felt better, but when he got off the medicine, he relapsed and he didn&#39;t know if it was persisting or getting better. Pericarditis was diagnosed on 11Apr2021 and it was ongoing and improving. Temperature was resolved the next day, the 11Apr2021 with the medicine. Patient was put on medication when he went to the Emergency Room. The medication was provided to deal with the inflammation. Ibuprofen was taken 600 mg by mouth, 3 times daily for inflammation, he took it from 11Apr2021 to 18Apr2021. The dose was lowered to 1200 mg per day, then 600 mg per day. When he went off of it, the symptoms came back. Caller was taking 200 mg tabs by mouth 6 times a day. Caller had a prescription dose that was higher before, the big ones, but that&#39;s over with now. Patient was taking colchicine at 0.6 mg by mouth once a day. It was an anti-inflammatory. The ibuprofen was stopped and after 3 weeks, his symptoms came back and he was put back on the ibuprofen. The colchicine was a 30-day prescription. He would run out this week and would renew it for a 30-day supply. Patient added these medications tear up the stomach, so they put him on pantoprazole at 40 mg once per day. The ibuprofen was 600 mg tabs, NDC: 65162-0465-50, quantity 21 tabs, no refills, Rx: 6330005, it was just in a bottle, not a shrink-wrapped thing. The diagnosis he had was acute pericarditis, peritonitis and the cause was unknown, but was being treated as a viral infection. He was asked if he had a cold or upset stomach, which would then indicate the type of infection he had but he didn&#39;t have anything. These would help determine which type of virus it was. In his case it was unknown and unknowable. When the caller was weaned off the ibuprofen his symptoms came back with in a couple days. His temperature went up, he experienced shoulder pain and was short of breath. He was put back on the ibuprofen at that time. He was anticipating many more weeks of symptoms based of the way he was being treated by the doctor. The patient added the symptoms that presented were almost the same as a heart attack and he was concerned when he started to experience those symptoms. There was no clear evidence of what has caused his symptoms, he did not know if it was by Covid-19 or the Covid-19 vaccine but it was possibility. Patient hoped it was not the vaccine. All the adverse events required a visit to emergency room and physician office. Therapeutic measures were taken for all the adverse events. The outcome of event body temperature increased was recovered on 11Apr2021, the outcome of event pericarditis was recovering, the outcome of events shortness of breath and peritonitis was unknown. The outcome of rest events was not recovered.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He gets routine cancer check ups every 6 months, on 5/19/21 he had his usual CT scan of his chest, which showed a new pleural effusion and a new pericardial effusion.  Then there was a growth between his pericardial fat 2 cm x 2 cm that is not cancer as he had a PET scan afterwards that was negative for any highlighted areas.  His Houndsfield Units for the mass was 6.2 cm is 35-36 HU.  He then saw his results online and they want to do biopsies to see what is in the growth and in the effusion.    They have not figured out what to do yet for these symptoms. so he is going to be undergoing additional testing.    He did not have any of these symptoms or problems on his previous 6 month check up and is concerned that it is due to the vaccine itself.  He is in good health and exercises on a continual basis, does not smoke and never had, but does have a couple of drinks a day, but nothing to excess.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 75y.o. year old  male with a known history of metastatic colon carcinoma currently receiving chemotherapy, presenting to the hospital with complaints of odynophagia and dysphagia with both liquids and solids over the past 2-3 days. Additional complaints included intermittent shortness of breath related to &#34;asthma&#34; - unchanged in character or severity from previously.. He denies any cough, chest pain, fever, chills, sweats. At presentation he was afebrile with stable vital signs and was maintaining an O2 sat of 100% breathing room air. Laboratory revealed a WBC of 40.4 with a predominance of neutrophils on the differential as well as toxic granulation (patient had just recently received Neulasta on 6/17), mild elevation of his alkaline phosphatase of 199 with a normal bilirubin, and normal renal function. CXR was negative for any acute pathology. For reasons that are unclear, testing for SARS CoV 2 by NAA was performed and was positive. The patient has a history of having had Covid in November 2020, and also received vaccination for Covid with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in April of this year. His any recent contact with anyone with Covid 19, and states that he has severely limited travel outside of his apartment to avoid social contact during the pandemic. ID is consulted regarding the above presentation. Significance unclear. This patient has little in the way of symptomatology to support a diagnosis of Covid 19. He had symptomatic infection with SARS CoV 2 in November 2020. Prolonged positive testing for SARS CoV 2 by NAA as been noted for months following Covid 19. In addition, prolonged shedding has been noted in patient&#39;s who are immunocompromised, although I would doubt that is the situation here as he is asymptomatic for Covid 19 (intermittent shortness of breath likely related to his underlying asthma as she is maintaining an excellent O2 sat breathing room air at this time and has a negative CXR). I do not think any therapy for Covid 19 is indicated at this time. Would doubt he is shedding infectious virus, but will continue isolation for now
