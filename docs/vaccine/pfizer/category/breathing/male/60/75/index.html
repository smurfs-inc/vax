                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

                                                This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Blood pressure high, Cancer (Two or less years ago; In remission, Taking medication to follow through with remission period), Allergies and sinus issues, covid virus (in July). The patient reported soreness in the arm (15Jan2021), fatigue (15Jan2021) and  palpitations (16Jan2021) that he felt below the mouth and above the heart, calling it the esophagus area. He wanted to know if others had reported this same palpitation. The reporter further reported that he has a little bit of concern. He felt fine, had sore arm and fatigue that has gone away. Noticed lately, somewhere in his esophagus between his heart and mouth that he is feeling palpitations. Doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s more indigestion. Stated it could be gas. Sometimes comes and goes, feels different than what he&#39;s already experienced. Wanted to double check if this has been heard of or anything similar to it. Clarified product as first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Received last Thursday. Received COVID-19 Vaccine in left arm on 14Jan2021 between 15:00 and 16:00. Both arms are sore, but only because other arm is injured. Pain level in injection arm was around 5-6 and he wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side. Within the second day, 16Jan2021 in late afternoon soreness and fatigue was gone. Indigestion or Palpitations, feeling was happening again. They wanted to know if that is something he is experiencing from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Stated it doesn&#39;t appear to be related. It is around the esophagus. Stated it affects breathing. Stated maybe that has something to do with it. For the dose, they noticed it was a small amount of fluid in the tube that was injected into him. The outcome of the events soreness in the arm/sore arm and fatigue was recovered on 16Jan2021, while for other events was unknown. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

The wife stated that she does not believe the death was due to the vaccination; however, there were no tests completed to prove or disprove.

He then required intubation, and had struggled with hypoxia, even on increasing PEEP. CODE BLUE called in the ED for PEA. He was medicated for such (please see the code run sheet for details), and he came in and out of the code 5 times. After 95 minutes, with the wife at the bedside, and family conference by phone, the code was called, and he was pronounced at 18:20. He received in total 8 me of Epi, 3 shots of Atropine, 3 amps bicarb. He got lasix 40 mg, lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous once. He had a CVC into the right internal jugular, and levophed was started, then Epinephrine drip was started.  Prior to the code he got steroids (solumedrol 125 mg, then later decadron 6 mg iv), benadryl iv, antibiotics (ceftraixone / zithromax), and lasix 40 mg. All this time while in the ED, the Rt was at the bedside, and lots of secretions from the lungs were aspirated, bloody color.   Code was the result of PEA secondary to hypoxia (&lt;/= 85%), despite being on the vent, with PEEP 12, FiO2 of 100%, with acidosis.   After 95 minutes of active resuscitation, the patient was found not responsive to painful stimuli. There was no palpable pulse. No spontaneous respirations. No heart or breath sounds by auscultation. Absence of pupillary light reflex.

He states he is taking his ProAIr inhaler every hour and it helps for the hour, but after that his breathing gets worse. Patient states he gets SOB with lying down and walking. Patient was speaking in full sentences and states it was because he just took his inhaler medication. Patient states he is positive for chills onset Sunday. Patient did have his first dose of COVID vaccine on Thursday. Denies difficulty breathing on Thursday, and per patient could have started Saturday night. DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition:   1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation (HCC)  Patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on p.r.n. albuterol at home as well as nightly Spiriva, coming to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 days with associated tightness with his breathing.  On arrival to the emergency department, patient is sitting forward, tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse expiratory wheezing.  He is saturating low 90s on room air.  He is placed on 2 L nasal cannula for comfort.  He received 2 DuoNeb treatments with EMS as well as Solu-Medrol.  I am going to treated with a continuous nebulizer treatment and obtained laboratory workup as well as chest x-ray.  Vital sign show tachycardia which is likely from his albuterol treatment, he is mildly tachypneic, otherwise stable.   Patient&#39;s laboratory workup is reassuring, troponin is negative.  Chest x-ray does not show any consolidation.  Patient does have some improvement in his symptoms after his continuous nebulizer treatment.  His VBG is repeated after treatment and shows that his pCO2 is going down however he is still slightly acidotic with the pH of 7.28.  Patient reports that he still tight in his chest, improved however uncomfortable going home.  He is still significantly wheezing on my exam, given this I did discuss this case with emergency department observation who agreed to accept for admission.  COVID testing is negative.

                                                1ST EPISODE, 01-15-21 10AM, it happened at the hospital where I work. I was walking flight of steps when i felt i was not getting enough air, i went to sat down and was unable to recover and went to the therapy office to sit down, where a coworker said i didn&#39;t look good, my BP 148/92. I felt sleepy, global weakness throughout my body. they took me to the ER where i had an EKG, CBC, thyroid test, angiogap glucose test. The EKG was normal and I stayed about 6hrs in the ER but went home. As the day passed my BP was 122/88 when i got home.  I wore a holter monitor for 5 days but don&#39;t have results yet. I felt fine for the next 6 days. SECOND EPISODE 01-21-21; i  woke up at 5am feeling so sad with despair and feelings of loneliness. I went to  work 11:45am, felt fine, sat down to do some work on my computer and I could feel it come up again, went to nurse station and checked my BP 144/90, i could feel my heart pounding and went to the ER again. I felt super foggy and unable to process things. They did a CTA of my neck and chest and a CT with perfusion which was normal. They did lab work and all was normal.  THIRD EPISODE 01-25-2021, i was at home happened around 9am, felt fine all morning and then i felt another episode come again. Same symptoms just not as dense as before and texted my wife. I had body aches, felt like I had the flu.     I saw my PCP 01-25-2021 (same day as my third episode)and set up an appointment  with a neurologist.

Used Albuterol inhaler twice, 5 minutes apart, and took Prednisone 20 mg orally.  Within 60-90 minutes, symptoms completely resolved and did not reoccur.  He did not seek medical attention at the time of this reaction, but called this office on 3/11/2021 so that the reaction could be documented.  That prompted today&#39;s office visit and the completion of this VAERS form.  Patient does have monthly allergy injections, but last injection was on 2/23/2021.

On the day pt was vaccinated, his sister picked him up for the appointment and pt refused a wheelchair. Pt walked into the clinic on his own and recevied his vaccine. Sister reported pt walked to the car after his vaccine and was winded. She dropped him off at his house and called him later to check up on him. Pt stated he was feeling fine but his arm was sore. Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied. Pt coded in parking lot of Doctor&#39;s Office and passed away at 4:31 p.m.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 29Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER8734) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization but reported to have had DOE for the past 3-4 days, has felt fatigued for the past week and his taste seems different over the past couple of days. It was reported that during the 15-minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience shortness of breath as he was walking out to the front. He reports no issues with the vaccine as he was waiting. He denied rash, hives, welts, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, throat tightness, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. The patient complaints of shortness of breath. There was no treatment therapy provided. Follow up response to treatment was excellent (also reported as no treatment provided). The patient was discharged as stable to go home and follow up with PCP (primary care physician). He completed his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (29Mar2021). He presented to respiratory clinic earlier today (30Mar2021) and was noted to be hypoxic and was sent to ED. He reported DOE (dyspnea on exertion) for the past 3-4 days and has felt fatigued for the past week. He notes that his taste seems different over the past couple of days. CXR (chest x-ray) on an unspecified date in 2021 shows opacity in the mid and lower left lung. He is tachypnea, tachycardia, high normal WBC and afebrile on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray showed opacity in the mid and lower L lung and white blood cell count was high normal on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further Information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of hypoxic cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after injection, I was awakened with heart pounding in my chest and it felt fast but I did not check it. Watch did not show higher than 84 through the night but I could not sleep much due to the heart pounding. Arose for work at 6:15 and felt tired but the palpitations did not bother while standing. Temperature 98.8. about 90 minutes later, while at work, HR was 130-148, I was breathing deeply, otherwise okay. Chills started about 17 hours post-injection and temperature rose as high as 102.4 in the next 3 hours. HR lowered to about 110 about 16 hours post injection and did not get below 100 for another 12 hours. some coughing throughout this time, not productive. Heavy night sweats around 34 hours post injection. I had mild chills about 48 hours post injection, and fine since then. The palpitations were very uncomfortable but stopped once the HR lowered to about 110

I also experienced a slight metallic taste in my mouth. I also sensed a somewhat increased heart rate and some slight dizziness. I did NOT experience any breathing difficulties but maybe had a very slight wheeze sensation. These reactions lasted only about 8 to 10 minutes then started easing away. I was monitored a full 30 minutes and then released after reporting I felt ok then.

Patient stated they were also having breathing difficulties. Immediately tested patients bloods pressure. Tested twice and came to 220/120 with heart rate 80. Was an emergent situation. Informed patient I was contacting 911 to have them take him to the hospital as this is an emergency situation. Went and made phone call. Had staff bring patient into waiting area so that we could monitor him if something worsened. 911 advised to just monitor the patient. If he began vomiting or passed out to have him on his side, so he doesn&#39;t choke from vomit. We monitored patient until ambulance arrived. They asked for current medications we knew of (listed in report) and that he had received Pfizer Covid vaccine 0.3ml resulting in emergency BP readings of 220/120 after receiving.  Ambulance took patient to Hospital. Current condition unknown or if anything even occurred after that point. Whole event lasted about 1 hour before patient left with medical personnel.

They felt he could have had a TIA, or extension of a prior CVA (nothing new on MRI, has small vessel ischemic disease), or a COVID vaccine reaction. Symptoms have mostly resolved, he is not always cooperative so subtle weakness is difficult to detect. He was hospitalizaed, started on ASA &amp; increased BP meds, and returned to his home, where he has resided for several years.

                                                Resident was vaccinated on 12/31/20. Then on 1/14/21 he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine surveillance PCR testing.  Another resident on the same hall was COVID positive on 1/11/21.  Results of the PCR test were obtained on 1/16/21.  He appeared asymptomatic at that time. Given his COVID positive status, all aerosol generating procedures had to be stopped. Overnight on 1/16/21 into 1/17/21, he had the onset of acute respiratory failure and was transported to the hospital. Per notes, he was put on BiPAP for several hours, but his CO2 level did not improve. Per prior advance directives completed with the resident and his two brothers, he had DNR/DNI orders.  The hospital physician spoke with his brother and the decision was made to  move to comfort care. He was discharged to inpatient hospice and died around 4pm on 1/18/21. This outcome does not appear to be vaccine-related, but death from COVID-19 infection is listed as a reportable event following COVID-19 vaccination.

Symptoms increased the next night, increasing each day to peak on day 8 (02/19/2021. Symptoms gradually decreased thereafter until 02/26/2021 at the time of this note. Symptoms are now very minor residual intranasal congestion and slightly more significant chest congestion. Symptom trajectory started as rhinorrehia and pronounced nasal congestion that partially responded to decongestants and improved more with nasal fluticasone. Bronchial congestion began after on day 3 to 4, with shortness of breath experienced overnight (never before experienced). Remarkable, intense aerobic exercise was done with no difficulty during the day, with some moderation taken on 02/19/2021. Fatigue did affect daily activities, but not dramatically. That this was a vaccine side effect signal is clear to me.

Patient received the covid19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 2/9/2021, vaccine was administered without complications. No prior positive for covid19. After patient received his covid19 vaccine, he was seen at same day access for increased SOB/DOE, worsened orthopnea. Per progress notes, at this last appt, patient had expressed a number of medications which he was not willing to take, attributing his worsened health to their effects. Pt has continued spironolactone despite being advised to stop it by his medical provider. At the time of visit, provider noted that this kidney function was declining (patient does have CKD). Provider discussed the importance of medication adherence and patient was started on torsemide. Hctz was discontinued, minoxidil was increased due to patient preference. Prior to this same day access/express care visit, patient was hospitalized from 1/26 through 1/28/2021 for hypertensive urgency (211/105) and that at that time, pt already had orthopnea, SOB, and dyspnea.

A 67-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 67 years). Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]); lisinopril; insulin taken for diabetes mellitus. The patient experienced thrombocytopenia, he had clot in the legs and in the lungs and have a low platelet count on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CBC: unknown result on 08Apr2021, Heparin associate antibody: unknown result, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP): unknown result and platelet count: low on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of thrombosis included Heparin drip and Argatroban. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are considered unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather intercurrent occurrences. Clots in the legs and in the lungs were likely favored by the mentioned diabetes and by a possible hyperlipidemia (the patient was taking  atorvastatin) in a setting of possible arterial hypertension (the patient was taking lisinopril).  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                Three days post-vaccine, I began to experience chest pressure and slight pain in my chest--directly under each of my armpits. After 3 hours I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and they suggested I call 911 and go to the Emergency Department to be sure I was not having a heart attack. Multiple EKGs, a chest xray, and blood tests revealed that my heart was in good shape. I have continued  to have very slight pressure in that area, but it is occasional and is almost gone. Even after 5 days since the vaccination, I am experiencing side effects although they have reduced in severity. Fatigue, occasional slight dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, occasional slight pain in various parts of my body.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

At first, it was intermittent, then as time progressed it became more &#34;permenant&#34;. I received the 2nd dose on february 23rd while still experiencing daily shortness of breath. Occasionally experienced loss of taste but that went away. I went to my doctor &amp; he took chest X-Ray. Showed partial &#34;collapse&#34; (right lung not functioning properly) of right lung. My doctor suggested &#34;deep breathing excersizes&#34; to re-expand portion of lung affected by side effect. I need to have additional X-Ray in 2 weeks (March 19th, 2021).

We gave him 2 Benadryl and checked on him about 8 times (roughly every 10 minutes or so) and he said he felt like normal. We checked on him a couple more times and he said he felt fine. We left him 2 more Benadryl just in case he needed it and we alerted the facility

Some shortness of breath.  Patient saw me a few days later feeling like he was dying.  He was treated with steroids and vitamin C along with glutathione IV treatment.  Started to feel better the next day.  A week later, felt nearly back to normal.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

He sat in his car a few more minutes with his wife not feeling as if he was completely well.  He returned to the clinic reporting tightness in his neck and throat area.  His blood pressure was taken 189/99.  He did not have difficulty breathing or any other signs of anaphylaxis but was given 50mg of benadryl as a precaution.

Physician was consulted and felt it was best to be seen in the ER.  The patient was transported to ER by his wife and seen.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                death Narrative:  70 yo male received COVID19 vaccine on 2/16/2021 (first dose) without complications. Patient was admitted to the facility on 3/12/2021 and transferred out to a hospital on 3/15/2021. Patient died on 3/24/2021 due to acute respiratory failure at a medical center. This report is being written because patient received Pfizer covid19 vaccine, Facility requires we report to VAERS if death occurs within 42 days of vaccination. Prior to his hospital admission, his previous one was 5/11/2020-5/14/2020. Please see below for hospital course at the Facility: 70 yo male with PMHx of COPD, CHFrEF 20%, CAD s/p MI and CABG in 1999, HLD, HTN, DM2, GERD, Anxiety and Depression who presented with increased shortness of breath to facility. Transfered on 3/13 to the facility. Noted increased SOB without CP, palpitations, cough, orthopnea or PND. No history of home O2 use but required 2-3L O2 during this hospital stay. Was noted on admit to Facility to have troponin elevation with unchanged EKG. Was started on NSTEMI protocol with heparin ggt, ASA, BB, and statin. Initially received one dose ceftriaxone/azithro for possible PNA. On admission, primary team held home BB. On arrival to Facility, troponin at 3.998 trended to 4.442 and then trended down. underwent CTA to evaluate for PE that was negative. CXR and CT showed pulmonary edema consistent with HF exacerbation and a proBNP 8613. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix x2. RRT was called twice, once for BP 80/50 treated with 500ml IVF, and second for CP that resolved with NTG and tramadol. Cardiology was consulted with goal to cath patient, however some concern for medication adherence going forward so they will reevaluate. Patient began to have tachycardia with rates in the 150s sustained and hypotension. EKG showed likely sinus tachycardia with wide QRS similar to prior EKGs. Patient has ICD in place that was interrogated and showed good function. IV metoprolol 5mg given x3 with rated decrease to upper 120s. Patient remained asymptomatic, awake, and alert. Per discussion with wife after transfer, patient BP has been in the 50s systolic at home for the last month. Cardiac cath was performed showing 99% stenosis of LCX. Did not tolerate procedure with nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. RRT was called after cath procedure. He is nauseous, diaphoretic. He complained of chest pressure. STAT EKG obtained. Noted ST depressions in the septal leads significant from before. Cardiology concerned pt was having an inferior MI. STEMI call was activated and hospital cath lab was called and report given to the cardiologist on call. Pt was then transported to the Facility and he passed away on 3/24/2021.

Presented to Hospital on 4/7 complaining of shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting  with elevated troponin and NSTEMI. Low suspicion that the vaccine caused this man?s heart attack as his hear cath showed severe multi-vessel disease. Pt gave inconsistent history in previous COVID infection: he told some he did have it and others that he did not .    CT surgery was consulted, and patient was not felt to have viable targets for CABG.  Cardiology discussed risks and benefits of an attempt at a high risk PCI to the LAD, and patient and family opted for medical management. Patiet discharge home on 4/10/21 with medical management for his coronary artery disease and new onset systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, including aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Coreg, furosemide, Entresto.

Allergy consulted due to anaphylactic reaction several hours after procedure. Patient was stable on RA at time of presentation and vitals were normal and stable during the procedure from 8-9 AM. Procedure log reviewed. He received fentanyl, versed, heparin, omnipaque, and xylocaine during the procedure. No immediate reactions noted and no change in vitals during procedure. He tolerated procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac recovery room on RA with normal vitals.   At 1217, patient received percocet and at 1 PM, desaturations noted on flowsheets (84% from RA). Noted pain level of 10/10. HR increased to 130s-150s and BP did drop as low as 99/87. Per notes, he developed shortness of breath, rash, and itching with this. Given albuterol, racemic epinephrine, diphenhydramine IV, famotidine IV, and solumedrol. After developing nausea, he was given IM epinephrine at 2:10 pm. Then, symptoms rapidly improved and he was transferred to CVICU. He was shortly weaned from BIPAP (briefly hypercarbic) to nasal cannula and eventually 1-2L NC.

                                                The patient started having right sided chest pain/rib pain minutes after receiving the 2nd dose of Covid 19 vaccine. When he presented to the medical treatment area he was c/o this right sided chest pain that was worsened by inspiration. The pain was non-radiating and was also associated w/ shortness of breath. He has been experiencing shortness of breath intermittently over the past couple of weeks. The patient denied associated dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, vision changes. He noted that he has a prior history of DVT and PE, but is not on any anticoagulation medications.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

After receiving the vaccine the patient went to the recovery area for the required 15 minutes. About 10 minutes later his breathing rapidly increased - eventually turning to large gasps of air. The patient then briefly passed out but then quickly woke up. He then started vomiting for the next 10 minutes. Eventually he recovered enough to walk with the help of his wife. The wife stated that he has had episodes like this from other vaccines and blood draws. He has never vomited from the episodes, however.

She put a heating blanket on him. She added that he was so cold that his fingertips were blue. The chills ended and he ran into a fever which lasted for 10 hours. She mentioned that if his fever would have been greater than 105 degrees, she would have sent him to the emergency room. The highest it reached was 103.2 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and cold compresses which brought his temperature down to 101. He was comfortable. Initially, on an unspecified date, his breathing, color and blood pressure were all good. While he had a fever, she observed that to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. From a cardiovascular view he is healthy. The local paramedics come and check on him periodically and the reporter monitors his glucose and blood pressure (unknown results). She stated that all of these were complicated by him having dementia. The reporter stated that he was getting better. She was not panicked and was not complaining. She wanted the officials to know that she thinks people who have had Covid should be tested to see the level of antibodies present or a titer test before having the vaccine and that maybe they not need the vaccine.

It was informed that patient had vaccination on right arm because he had a dialysis fistula in his left arm. Relevant medical history included also ongoing End stage renal disease, dialysis on 13Apr2021. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP6955) and experienced arm pain and headache. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 11Apr2021 the patient experienced shivering and quaking and chills, nauseous and vomiting, panic attack, &#39;was freaking out&#39;, soft pain in left side of chest, fast pulse , all provided as non serious. On the same day 11Apr2021 the patient also experienced difficulty breathing, low oxygen blood level,  potassium level increased and extra fluid in his body which led to the emergency room and admission to the hospital. Clinical course was described as follows: everything was going good until Sunday at 3:29 am. Her husband woke up shivering, quaking, and he was freaking out repeating oh my god, so she called emergency number.  When her husband found out that she couldn&#39;t get into the ambulance with her husband and ride to the hospital, so her husband refused to go to the hospital. She states that her husband also felt nauseous and vomited in this period of time. She stated that he had no fever, though. So fast forward to 8:30 am her husband was having difficulty breathing, and she called again and this time they had 7 paramedics come out to the house. She states that all of them were very nice. An EKG was performed because patient reported that he had a soft pain in his left side of his chest. She states that everything was cool with that, except his pulse rate was high. She states that he also had low blood oxygen level. She states that they strapped in her husband in and drove him to the hospital to the ER. At the ER they discovered that potassium level increased and she said that he had some extra fluid in his body. He was a dialyses patient so they gave him dialysis on Sunday evening. He had calmed down at that point and they were constantly taking blood from him. She found out about the COVID vaccine had potassium and phosphate as active ingredients and her husband shouldn&#39;t have that. She also informed that they had to give him a tranquilizer because he was having a panic attack during this whole episode. She says that they gave him alprazolam. Patient doesn&#39;t know exactly when the side effects went away because he didn&#39;t have a clock or a phone. Patient&#39;s wife also clarified that he vomited twice before going to the hospital but then he felt like he had to vomit afterwards but he did not. She stated that his breathing problems didn&#39;t stop when paramedics came and gave him oxygen. They made it to their house by 8:40 am, and he still had low oxygen level, they were still giving oxygen the whole time he was in the hospital. The patient was discharged on 13Apr2021. At the time of the reporting event outcome was unknown.

Medical history included Histoplasmosis (it&#39;s a lung fungus), Hepatitis B, and meningitis. Concomitant medications included unspecified blood thinner. The patient got the first Pfizer COVID shot Friday morning. He experienced feeling lousy. And about 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon on 29Jan2021, he started feeling kind of &#39;wheezy&#39; as by 1 o&#39;clock and his stomach (incomplete sentence). At 3 o&#39;clock, he started throwing up, he had the dry hives for about 3 hours along with diarrhea. And then he had a temperature. He laid down and woke up just heavy sweat on the break down he meant big time. At 2 in the morning (30Jan2021) he couldn&#39;t breathe, little short breath and that lasted about 3 hours that was Friday night. On Saturday (30Jan2021), his stomach was still upset with diarrhea, still had the headache and really tired on Saturday and today Sunday. No treatment received for the events.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

                                                Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor&#39;s meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer&#39;s reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided. The outcome was recovered on 04Feb2021 for the event &#34;sore left arm at injection site&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;shortness of breath&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;blood clot in right lung&#34;.

                                                Beginning the day after the inoculation, my husband began feeling worse in terms of his difficulty in breathing.  He used the  Albuterol inhaler more than usual.  It progressively got worse over the next 2 weeks, ending with my husband?s sudden collapse and death exactly 2 weeks later on April 5, 2021.  The inoculation may or may not have been directly linked to his unexpected death, but I feel it may have exasperated his condition, which led to his death.   And I feel it is important to report this to you.  I later heard that he should not have been using his Albuterol inhaler one week prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine.  I don?t know if that is true, but that information was never told to my husband, if it is.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Feb2021 (about 9:20AM-9:30AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unspecified date at 73-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had his second COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday, 21Feb2021 and had a significant reaction. Last night (21Feb2021), about 12 hours later, he started getting a headache, he was breathing really fast, and shivering. He tried to calm himself down and went to bed. This morning (22Feb2021) he got up around 7AM and still wasn&#39;t feeling too well. His temperature was slightly elevated at 98.9 on 22Feb2021. His normal temperature is 97.1. He knows his own body and was pretty convinced his reaction was from a slightly elevated temperature and everything that comes with that. He went back to bed this morning and slept until 11:30AM. He got up and felt good. He took his temperature a few minutes ago and it was back to 97.1. The outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and safety profile of the product, the contributory role of the suspect product  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), to reported events cannot totally be excluded.

                                                Fluid overload; shortness of breath; Graft clotted off; This is a spontaneous report from the Pfizer sponsored program. A contactable Nurse reported that a 73-year-old male patient (husband) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration, on Right Arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes, ongoing Vascular problems, ongoing Congestive heart failure; all (At least 15 years ago), blood thinners, dialysis from Sep2020 (husband has been on Dialysis since Sep2020. last time he was dialyzed was 11Feb2021) and Allergic to seafood and nuts. Concomitant medication(s) included clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) for blood thinner and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) for blood thinner. The patient experienced fluid overload and shortness of breath on an unspecified date, graft clotted off on 13Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized for fluid overload from 16Feb2021 to an unknown date. She stated that her husband is on dialysis in the hospital and is going to miss the second dose appointment for the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. She wanted to know what to do about the second dose. She wanted to know how long a person has to be off steroids before getting the vaccine and if she can reschedule the second dose appointment as he was hospitalized. Her husband is allergic to seafood and nuts. His appointment is at 10:30 (On 17Feb2021). She reported that he is on dialysis and his graft clotted and he has not had any dialysis in about a week. Her husband had fluid overload and shortness of breath. She said that he had to have an emergency port put in and they dialyzed him in the ER. He typically goes Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday. She said that he had not been dialyzed in over a week and he was getting fluid overload. She said that the last time he was dialyzed was 11Feb2021. She clarified that her husband has been on Dialysis since Sep2020. She said that when he got his Covid vaccine they checked that he was on Plavix and Aspirin. She said that they are supposed to hold the site because he has the tendency to bleed more while on blood thinners, but she does not know if that was the reason. She said that she knows what it was and he had to be dialyzed because of the fluid, but she was not told that her husband had fluid overload by the physician. She said that her husband has congestive heart failure as well. The patient was hospitalized due to Fluid overload from 16Feb2021 to ongoing. Outcome of all events was unknown and for remaining event Graft clotted off was not recovered. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal assosciation between the suspect, BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the events, fluid overload, graft clotted, shortness of breath is unrelated. The impact of this report on benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 14Feb2021 at 15:45 (Lot Number: EL3247) (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, family history, or concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: E10142 (as reported)), in the right arm, on 24Jan2021 at 15:45 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung in Feb2021, which required hospitalization from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated he did not know what date the blood clots occurred and can&#39;t tell when that happened, but it was maybe a few weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. He stated that one blood clot is in the right leg near the calves and the blood clot broke and split some and went up into the side of his lung as it was detected in a doppler on 27Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The doppler was performed as soon as he went into the emergency room and they went through a series of tests with unknown results on 27Feb2021 and 28Feb2021. The patient stated that the right leg is bigger than the other leg and they told him it might stay that size and may not go down. The patient is now on apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg for the rest of his life. In the beginning, they gave him an unspecified shot in his stomach, then after that he began taking apixaban at two pills in the morning and two pills at night, then they cut him down to 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening, and he started it right when he went into the hospital immediately. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung was unknown.

Reporter was reporting for both her husband and herself. This is the second case of two cases.  A 73-year-old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, lot number: EL9265) via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 04Feb2021 at single dose and second dose via an unspecified route of administration in arm (lot number: EN6202) on 25Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Reporter stated, &#34;they were calling about a specific batch of the Pfizer vaccine. Her husband and she received. They were vaccinated at the February 25th and we both have tested positive.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;they got both shots.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;04Feb2021 and 25Feb2021.&#34; When probed for whether husband and wife got the Covid Vaccine shots on same dates: Reporter stated, &#34;Yes, together.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;For him it was 31Mar2021, for her it was 01Apr2021. He got tested would be 31Mar2021. Reporter stated, &#34;I have you mean because of the testing positive, the symptoms. they don&#39;t have medical condition.&#34; Medical condition for husband, Reporter stated, &#34;Well right now he was, he was in the hospital on oxygen because he tested positive on 30Mar2021.&#34; Date of hospitalization for husband, Reporter stated, &#34;He entered the hospital same day he was tested, 31Mar2021. 30Mar2021 he went in.&#34; When probed if he was still in the hospital, Reporter stated, &#34;He was still in the hospital.&#34; Reason for hospitalization, Reporter stated, &#34;Because he was having breathing difficulty and some of the Covid symptoms on 30Mar2021. patients who took the Covid vaccine from Pfizer and have tested positive for month or two later.&#34; Outcome of events was not recovered.

He  was given 0.3 mls of the vaccine IM in the left deltoid.at 2:40 pm.  He pulled around to the observation area and at 3:12 pm.   He reported that he was experiencing tightness in his chest, dizziness and SOB.  Sp02 was 97% on RA.  HR was 57.  Oxygen applied via non-rebreather mask at 6L .  Sp02 went up to 100%.  At 3:05 patient reports that his chest tightness was feeling better and reported that it was easier to breathe.  He denies any numbness or dizziness.  Sp02 was 98% at this time.  BP was 138/84.  At 3:12 patient reports that the tightness in his chest has subsided and that he was &#34;feeling better&#34;.  Sp02 was turned off.  After observing patient for several minutes she was found to be in stable condition to leave the observation unit.  He was agreeable to this plan.  He will notify her PCP with any further symptoms.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

Had to go to bed sitting up with three pillows on my back. The next morning went to doctor who ordered blood test and chest X-Ray. Chest X-Ray indicated Pulmonary Embolism. Doctor started me on Eliquis blood thinner to hopefully desolve the blood clot on my lung. Doctor suggested I report Pulmonary Embolism occuring same day as my first vaccine shot. Do not know if shot caused Pulmonary Embolism or just a coinsidence. In addition doctor found blood in my urine and a CT of Bladder has been ordered

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

He was having some difficulty breathing so reached for his BREO &amp; his legs wouldn&#39;t hold him up.  He collapsed to the floor.  His wife got him to bed where he stayed for a few minutes.  He got up again &amp; walked a few steps to the master bathroom, started brushing his teeth &amp; his legs collapsed again where his wife caught him &amp; helped with controlled descent.  He could not remember some of the first collapse &amp; none of the second collapse.   He crawled to bed &amp; stayed for 1/2 hour.  Got up &amp; felt fine the rest of the day &amp; since then.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:10 AM  (at the age of 75 years), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney transplant. Concomitant medication included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MYCOPHENOLATE), prednisone. Historical vaccine included Dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982), on 14Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization). On 05Feb2021 at around 18:00 PM, the patient had what he believed was an anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest (he clarified that upper chest as where the neck meets the chest. It may have been a little lower, but not that far down that he would have worried. It was the upper chest where the neck meets the chest. Not in the chest to the left or right). It lasted intermittently for 4 days. He reported that it was not continuous, it would come for 2-3 hours dissipate and then come again. It wasn&#39;t all day and all night. He reported &#34;I&#39;m better now&#34;. The clinical outcome of anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest  was recovered on 10Feb2021.

I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.

                                                Patient was a healthy 75 year old male when he got the shot.  Within  5 hours, he began to feel TIRED, which was an expected side effect. He felt tired for several days. Nine days later he went to Memorial Hermann ER in Kingwood, and they said he had pneumonia. They also said he had a &#34;small mass&#34; at the bottom of his lung and might want to get it checked out. On March 20, he developed a cough. On March 21 we went to a different ER and a CT scan showed he had plureal effusion.  On the next day he was short winded. He went back to the ER and they admitted him and transferred him to hospital by ambulance.  On March 23, 1.7 liters of fluid was drained from his lung and sent to be tested. On March 26 he was diagnosed with malignant plureal effusion. He passed out at the doctor office and tranferred to to another facility by ambulance. He remained there for 4 days for tests, and a port was put in to drain the fluid. On March 29 he was transferred .  They repeated many tests and did a bronchoscopy.  On April 1 they told him he had squamous cell carcinoma.  He came home on April 2. The doctor called and said they made a mistake he had small cell carcinoma.  He remained home until April 11, when he was taken back to  by ambulance.  He had gone from a healthy appearing individual on March 17 to a critically ill individual and he died on April 15.  Doctors had never seen cancer overtake a man in 28 days. 28 days!!!!  On March 22, he had a small mass at the bottom of his lung, and one week later, it was a mass so large, his lung could not be seen and his lung had collapsed.  Doctors assumed that the cancer was dormant and that the vaccine did something to wake it. It attacked my husband with a vengeance.  He never smoked.
