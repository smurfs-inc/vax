                                                About half an hour after receiving 2nd dose, I started to feel a little nauseous and my throat felt like it was tightening a bit. It was nothing too major, but I did call paramedics to monitor me. The episode subsided about a half hour after that.  However, I did have a more severe episode a few days later on March 5th, in which I had to receive urgent care. It was shortly after lunch which included a spicy hot sauce I had a little bit of.  I started having a similar reaction as earlier described, which eventually subsided once at the doctors office for a bit. However, it did lead to a panic attack, which is something I had never had before.  Overall, I had never reacted like this before. I am wondering if one the side effects of the vaccine may be causing it.

It&#39;s hard to breathe without coughing and pain. And the nausea came I had body aches too. But everything else went away except for the nausea which has been haunting me and the difficulty breathing which has limited the amount of work i do at work and has had an impact on my sleeping as well.

Heart rate increased a bit. Slightly labored breathing. Started feeling overall strange throughout body, general malaise. Didn&#39;t advance beyond this. Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

                                                Around 7 pm I started feeling really anxious. I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package.

                                                When I woke up on Sunday, April 11th, 2021 at around 9am, I have felt like my muscles have been ripped apart, I was sweating, I had labored breathing, and I could not get up for the day. I slept all day, feeling like I had the flu, and was sleeping until 7pm that day. I called out of work when I woke up because I knew on Monday I would not be able to make it, as I felt like I was very tired, lethargic, and sore. This feeling was throughout every inch of my body. I also went to take a shower that day and I had a hard time breathing in the shower, to the point where I had to sit on the edge of the tub, just to make sure I would not pass out from lack of oxygen. This was the scariest sickness I have ever had in my entire life. I literally thought I was going to die. Monday came around and I felt even worse, my muscles were sore, I felt extremely tired, I could not do anything, and I was in bed all day. Today is Tuesday, and I have felt a little bit better, but I have missed two days of work because of the effects this vaccine has had on my body. I made a virtual appointment with a doctor on the app on phone and met with Doctor who basically told me that the only thing I could do for myself is take Ibuprofen every 8 hours for the pain and swelling that might occur and drink plenty of gatorade. It is Tuesday, April 13th, 2021 at 11:29pm at night and I still feel the same as Monday, very weak, tired, and sore all over my body. I have never had this with a vaccine before, until I got the COVID-19 one. I have taken the Flu Vaccine, Hep A, Tantnius, Chicken Pox and never felt like I was so tired I could not get out of bed from these vaccines.

I then got itchy eyes, had some wheezing, and sneezed/got a runny nose. About a half hour after getting these symptoms, I took 10mg of children?s Benadryl (Diphenhydramine). I then found two hives/itchy bumps. One on my right arm near my elbow and one on the left side of my abdomen. About 20 minutes after taking the Benadryl, the symptoms mostly went away and I felt very tired. I still have some wheezing.

                                                After first Pfizer dose, I was just feeling really tired. After the second dose, around that afternoon/evening I started feeling my mouth feeling weird. The next day I saw blisters filled with yellow/whiteish puss in my tongue. I went to the ER later i felt a lump under left shoulder while showering. On 28 MAY 3 AM I suddenly felt my face feeling numb and tingly along with my legs. Mind you I have been in the field emplacing howizters for the past few days in a field exercise. I also jammed my finger on an 80 lb metal bar on 26 MAY and got my finger poked with a hot device that also drained the blood after getting an xray. I called medical ER  at 242 and spoke to Dr.(?) Doctor did not give me his name spelling after I asked for the spelling and he told me that I could always come in to the ER. I told him whether the finger pricking and blooding draining could cause the left facial numbness and legs tingleness. He said no so i am now assuming it is an adverse side effect. I am a smart guy have bachelors in journalism but right now I cannot concentrate and filling out htis form hastily just i case the effects get worse and I have to go to hospital er. Talking to the Dr. (?) was harder than normal and he asked if my breathing was normal, I said i am breathing heavily, which I did not have much control over. He said breathe normally and I will be better from the tingliness. I can write well I am a journalism major but this is hard to write for me . I am also feeling chills and I am also not feeling well. I was able to get this link from my local online meeting and I am glad I can contribute to the research and science in general. I wish the doctor had tested me for possible problems when I had an adverse effect from the first vaccine but the doctor told me to come back if the &#34;viral infection&#34; gets worse after I breathe normal. I did take a PT test and my 2 mile run time increased and it was much harder to run than the 2 mile run. Time went up by at least 3 minutes.

On Tuesday 5.18.21 started to develop chest tightness and pressure (like someone was pushing against the center of my chest). Also experienced some shortness of breath. Went to Emergency Room Fri 5.21.21, all tests came back fine. Went to cardiologist in early June 2021 and in early June a cardiac MRI found everything to be normal. Cardiologist has me taking advil and prilosec at the moment. Have experienced these symptoms since 5.18.21 and has not gone away.

I also felt that I was breathing heavier than normal while doing normal activities, such as walking or going up stairs. I also feel as if when my heart does get elevated my heart is thumping and beating much harder than normal. This is unusual for me as I am young and in very good shape. This also came with frequent panic attacks.

                                                On days 1 and 2, I experienced normal symptoms from receiving the vaccine, fatigue, joint and head aches that lasted through the weekend and up to day 5. On day 5, I noticed unilateral lymphedema of my tonsils. On day 7, I went to an Urgent Care but didn&#39;t get much treatment. My condition worsened, I was fatigued, no appetite and thirsty. On day 8, I popped a fever of 103. On day 9, it worsened to the point that it was hard to breathe. I went to the ER on 10 and had a full array of tests. I was treated with dexamethasone and a bolus saline IV. My symptoms went away after treatment around day 14, but the lymphedema lingered for awhile longer.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient had started to clear his throat more often.  Continued to monitor patients symptoms and did not have any worsening of symptoms and after approximately 5 minutes, he stated he felt better. EMS arrived and discussed with patient and he elected to refuse transport to the hospital. He has a buddy in the parking lot who drove him here.

All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

A 30-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant drug. The patient experienced recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid on 04Jan2021 00:30, mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage on 31Dec2020, loss of smell on 02Jan2021, exhaustion/feeling tired on 03Jan2021, felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe, he still has his sense of taste, but it is dulled on an unspecified date. He was a pharmacist. He received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on Thursday 31Dec2020 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he got the typical side effects of the vaccine that are posted. Then 2.5 days letter he no longer had a sense of smell. Everything he read said that he probably came in contact with COVID prior to administration. His questions was since he test positive for COVID, should he still get the second shot. He got it at a clinic. He did experience mild congestion which started by 6 o&#39;clock. He started to notice slight congestion that kind of went away. Then, on Friday, about 24 hours later, he really noticed he had congestion. He took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). Then his sense of smell diminished with the congestion and felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe. On Saturday, he decided to not take medication. That was when he noticed he could not smell anything. He had full blown congestion. It probably took two days when he started to lose his sense of smell. He received the shot on Thursday. On Saturday, he lost his sense of smell. He still has his sense of taste, but it was dulled. Sunday, he was just exhausted and feeling tired. These were all listed as typical side effects except for the loss of smell. Saturday was the worst. The congestion went into full nasal drainage. On Sunday he had no sinus issues. He still hasn&#39;t gained his sense of smell back. The exhaustion set in Sunday 03Jan2020. He doesn&#39;t feel like any of the side effects are serious. The exhaustion has started to let up some so it is improving. He was pretty much back to normal. He just couldn&#39;t figure out why he had a loss of smell. He had a COVID rapid test on 04Jan2021 at 8:30 am (as reported). He received an alert and hour later that it was positive. He was wondering whether the loss of smell could be from the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 rapid POC test: positive on 04Jan2021. The outcome of events for mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage was resolved on 03Jan2021, for loss of smell was not resolved, for exhaustion/feeling tired was resolving, for other events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported event &#34;recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid&#34; is considered possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known drug safety profile.

I had him sit down in the counseling room. 911 was called and ems was dispatched. in the mean time store management brought him water. I asked the patient again if he was having difficulty breathing and he said no, but he felt dizzy and his heart rate was elevated. I asked him if he had any difficulty swallowing, or any swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth or throat - pt denied all symptoms. patient also denied a rash or any itching when asked. I also asked the patient if he had any nausea, which he stated he did. he continued to deny all symptoms except dizziness, and nausea when asked, and in talking to him while waiting for emt he never displayed any symptoms that would lead me to believe he was having difficulty breathing, or a true allergic reaction. when emt arrived and examined him his pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation was normal, and the patient stated he felt better and had a history of anxiety. patient declined to go to the hospital, waited in the pharmacy for a while longer, and had a friend come pick him up

                                                severe dyspnea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). This  30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Jan2021 (Lot Number: EK9231) at the age of 30 years, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 in Mar2020. The patient had no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in right arm, on 20Dec2020, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 26Jan2021 the patient experienced severe dyspnea, seriousness criteria reported as disability.  The clinical course was reported as follows:  Patient with history of COVID-19 infection in Mar2020 developed severe dyspnea approximately 2 weeks after vaccination. Refractory to treatment with bronchodilators. Only responsive to high-dose steroids. Of note, patients symptoms from COVID-19 had completely resolved months prior to vaccination and patient had no other medical history. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe dyspnea and included Breztri, albuterol, prednisone. The clinical outcome of the severe dyspnea event was not recovered. . It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had tested for COVID-19: Sars-cov-2 test: negative on 04Feb2021 with nasal swab.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dyspnea cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

Woke up at 1:00 am with severe chills.  Lasted 2 hours.  -Threw on sweats and another blanket, went back to sleep. 3. Woke up at 6:30 am with intense body and head pain.  &#34;was a cant get comfortable in any position type of pulsing pain&#34; Something im accustomed to when i get the Flu.  I rolled around in pain for 4 hours while trying to go back to sleep; it even hurt to breathe deeply. - took Tylenol at 11am and the symptoms never came back.  *Note.  I think i suffered so much pain in the 4 hours that it lasted with me until even now as i write this.  Hard to describe, but my entire body has had this tiny ache that has not gone away.  Not a big deal to me, but just wanted it documented.  I am selecting recovered even with that tiny ache still apparent because physical pain usually takes time to heal.  Assuming that&#39;s all it is.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  I got the vaccine on Friday, and on Saturday night I developed phantosmia. Until now, basically 55h hours after the first shot, I feel cigarette smell very frequently. Sometimes is weak, sometimes is strong, but there are rare moments that I don&#39;t feel it at all - usually noticed when I start to feel it again. In the beginning, I thought that it could be caused by a roommate, but when I talked with them no one was smoking or feeling the smoke smell. When I came to lab, a clean space, I felt it again and noticed that it was really abnormal and that I should report. Additional info: I had a positive test for COVID-19 on January 16th and recovered really well after having only a mild fever for one day and a sore throat for 4 days. I am sure I also had COVID-19 in January of 2020 after a trip, when I had very bad symptoms including heavy lungs, pain in the lungs, yellow mucus, coughing, sore throat, headaches, and fever - and also a negative test for Flu at my health center.  At that time, mainly because of the negative test, doctors described it as a strong cold. It lasted for two weeks. We didn&#39;t think it could be COVID at that time, though. I realized that later when we learned more about the symptoms.

                                                Roughly two weeks after injection, I started noticing inflammation in my neck and throat as well as a post-nasal drip.  I had difficulty swallowing and felt pressure on my windpipe.  This has diminished a bit, but has now become shortness of breath and pressure on my chest.

                                                On 4/19 he received the first dose of Pfizer vaccine oh 4 PM.  Administration of vaccine was uneventful.  The next day he noticed sore shoulder at 3 PM on 4/20 he noted he had upper wrist pain that progressed to his right thumb as well as redness with a shiny quality that was consistent with previous gout flares so he took 2 doses of colchicine and 2 doses of Advil which did not relieve his symptoms.  A couple hours later he noted hand numbness and tingling as well as feet numbness and tingling bilaterally.  The numbness progressed to his extremities with the left arm more affected than the right arm (he received vaccine in his left arm).  He had accompanied pain of his extremities and wrists that was described as 10 out of 10.  He then felt 2 episodes of chest tightness and difficulty breathing prompting him to present to the strong ED.  In the ED his exam was notable for hypertension (240/90), tachycardia, wrist flexion in distress and yelling in pain.  His exam also showed bilateral hyperflexion of bilateral wrist with mild swelling and diminished sensation and motor function throughout.  He was administered IV hydromorphone, and Benadryl with dramatic improvement in his symptoms.  His labs are notable for abnormal electrolytes including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and he was repleted with magnesium potassium and phosphorus.  He is admitted to ED OBS. overall felt his symptoms were most likely due to gout flare and hyperventilation, not likely related to vaccine.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt very tired and winded as if I was working out for hours on no food. I did eat that day. I felt dizzy and saw black dots in my vision and felt the need to sit down. I never made it to sit, rather fell flat on my face and passed out for a few moments before my cousin came and picked me up asking what happened. It was very embarrassing and I believe the fall on my face caused an infection in my jawline on the left side and a sinus infection. I was throwing up and blowing my nose from blood. Very scary sight to see.

Heart rate normalized after half hour of rest. b) Acid reflux three days after vaccination. Took Omeprozole &amp; Sucralfate tabs and recovered within 3 weeks. c). Tachycardia &amp; palpitation occurred on 4/12/2021. Hard to fall asleep at night. Visited ER, no treatment (blood test, chest X-ray and EKG all normal).   d).  Excessive fatigue following just a few steps of walk, or speaking just a brief moment. Began to be sensitive to screen light and sound from loudspeakers. e). Hospitalized on 4/16/2021, b/c of breathing problem, numbness (hands &amp; feet) and muscle cramps. Called 911 for ambulance to hospital. Discharged on 4/18/2021 after testing normal for chest X-ray, EKG, echocardiogram. Prescribed Bisoprolol Fumarate tabs.  f). After discharge from hospital, I had to remain on bed b/c of breathing difficulty upon standing up or slight movement. Excessive sweat during sleep or after meals. g). Subsequently I felt a little better and began to do minor exercises (walking in the yard) May 14-19.  While lying on the bed on the night of May 19, I felt short of breath and worsening of breathing patterns (i.e. shallow breathing). h) On May 23, I began to feel shortness of breath when I walk or after a meal. i) Staring May 24th, I felt very weak breathing when lying on bed. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume. j) Staring May 27th, I felt shallow breathing when I was at rest during the day. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume.

                                                throat itchy and scratchy; hard to breathe; fever; fatigue; arm pain; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer, the patient. A 31-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA vaccine; Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 16Mar2021 at 12:00 pm (at the age of 31 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 17Mar2021 at 1:15pm the patient developed itchy throat and scratchy, found hard to breathe (difficulty breathing), fever, fatigue and arm pain. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of itchy throat, difficulty breathing, fever, fatigue and arm pain was not resolved.   Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

                                                I was sitting down at work when out of the blue I experienced heart palpitations, lightheadedness, weakness and shortness of breath that lasted for about an hour. I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

Clinic staff notified me and I immediately administered 0.3 mg of epinephrine via an auto-injector. 911 was called and Pt. was able to sit back up while he waited for EMS.

He was in his usual state of health and doing well until he received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 0740 this morning.  Around 10 minutes following the vaccine, patient became short of breath, lightheaded and had his vision gray out before losing consciousness for few seconds.  Patient was sitting in a chair at that time and did not fall or hit his head.  He was then given juice and was able to ambulate and felt better.  Patient was directed to the emergency department for evaluation.  He states that he now feels back to his baseline with no lightheadedness or difficulty breathing.  Patient states that he has passed out following blood draws in the past and usually lies down afterward. Patient&#39;s presentation is overall most consistent with vasovagal syncope, especially given his history of similar events following blood draws.   Patient was observed in the emergency department for nearly an hour and remained asymptomatic so he was discharged home with return precautions

Pt. states that he was walking to his car after his thirty minutes was up and started to feel the reaction.  After Pt. came back in he was instructed to sit down, and it was determined that Pt. throat was swelling. Pt. took 50mg of his own benadryl orally. Pt states the benadryl is not helping and its getting increasingly difficult to swallow. Pt. was brought into the back room where he walked without difficulty.  Pt. was given 0.3 of Epi in his left arm.  Pt. stated that his throat was starting to improve five minutes after injection.  Pt. care was transferred to Ambulance without incident.

                                                Swelling in the neck started a few days after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine.  Its not known if the swelling is related to the vaccine.  Medical exam by primary said my thyroid is a bit full.  Some post nasal drip as well.  Discomfort from the swelling became gradually more significant over several days.  Some tightness when swallowing food.   At this time of year I typically get allergy symptoms of hay fever (sneezing, itch/watery eyes, etc.) but neck swelling has never been a symptom for me.  Started taking Claritin once a day as I usually do this time of year as well.

Night shower at appr. 9 p.m. caused a feeling of spinal nerve pinch followed by acute pain during certain movements and breathing. Following day (Wednesday) spent in bed taking Ibuprophene thinking is just a nerve pinch. Called virtual appointment tele doctor who prescribed Katorolac which I took from Wednesday night to Thursday morning per prescription with no effects. On Thursday evening called tele doctor again and got Ibuprophene 800 mg prescription. It helped for 20-30 min only. Same evening coughed some blood. On Friday kept taking Ibuprophene for very temporary relieve. On Saturday April 10 was admitted to hospital and was hospitalized with blood cloth diagnosis for 4 days.

Within 24 hours severe shortness of breath and severe chest pains. Went to 2 urgent cares. Was prescribed Prednisone and a Inhaler. Both did nothing. Symptoms got worse. went to my primary doctor who ordered a chest X ray which came back good. and a EKG which came back with a slight issue and referred me to a cardiologist next month. Was sent home to recover. Pain and shortness of breath got worse. Within a week after that i got severe headaches and the left side of my head arm and leg began to get numb and tingle sensation  which lasted about 48 hours. About 2 weeks after vaccine i began to improve. Chest pain started to go away and my shortness of breath as well. As of today 4-18-2021 no chest pain, and shortness of breath still comes and goes but nothing compared to weeks before.

Patient agreed to sign AMA and was picked up from the facility (Regency Mall) by family member.

A 33-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6204; Expiration date was not reported) on the right arm on 26Mar2021 (18:45) as a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. On 31Mar2021, the patient had blood clot in the right lung. The event resulted into doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinical visit and emergency room/department or urgent care, and the patient was hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 for two days due to the event. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The outcome of the event, &#39;blood clot in the right lung&#39;, was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 with lasting effects. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had tested negative for COVID-19 nasal swab test on 01Apr2021.

Experienced a peak again around noon on 4/30/2021, but is milder again as I submit this.

                                                Patient post-vaccination (Pfizer/0.3ml/1st dose administered @10:23a) appeared to be seizing in his chair during observation @ 10:26a.  I rushed to him, requesting aid from his colleagues to help lay him on the ground and elevate his feet. He was unresponsive and disoriented, with shallow breathing and weak pulse, so I activated EMS @ 10:26a.  He appeared to seize again so I instructed two men to help roll him onto his side, at which time, an RN managing the vaccines, took over monitoring while I talked to 911.  EMS was on scene @ 10:29a. RN reports he&#39;d had a vagal response, most likely due to witnessed severe anxiety during IM injection (name /right deltoid @ 10:23a). RN gave him Gatorade and he quickly became AOx3.  When EMS arrived, he was able to stand up, with assist, and be placed on the gurney.  EMS monitored him for ~ 20min onsite, at which time he became hypotensive, resulting in transport to the nearest ER with O2 and IV management.  Per HR representative for a business patient was discharged @ ~2p the same day, with diagnosis of severe dehydration and hypokalemia, his reaction most likely a vagal event.  Unknown if medications were given outpatient.

                                                I had no side effects immediately after receiving either my first or second Pfizer shot. However, in both cases, a little over three weeks after I received the shot, I experienced a one day illness that started with nausea in the morning with no vomiting, followed by roughly 3/4 of the rest of the day experiencing extreme fatigue, some coughing and inability to take a full breath without coughing in the morning (this cleared by the afternoon). A lack of appetite was also observed.  I don?t know if this is a side effect, or just an evenly spaced illness coincidence. However, the fact that two identical illnesses that essentially cleared in a day and mirrored some COVID symptoms affected me after receiving the vaccines makes me wonder. I?ve never had an illness like this that comes on so strong, but then clears so quickly.

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

Other symptoms: lightheadedness and fatigue continuing from 1 day after vaccination. Chest pain continued; going to a clinic was advised by multiple sources. At 9:00 AM, went to a clinic and got a CKG. The CKG was normal. I concluded that the problem was chest wall inflammation, and took ibuprofen. With ibuprofen, the chest pain was mostly gone by 8:00 PM.

I was very stressed about it and it had been six days since the shot, so I just assumed I was either having a heart attack or a really bad panic attack. I did a meditation and chewed a couple aspirin just in case.  There was extreme tightness in my chest. Breathing was difficult. The dizziness, nausea, and inability to control my body temperature went away within a couple hours and I managed to sleep. But the chest tightness and difficulty breathing persisted for about 3 or 4 days.  I also noticed it hurt more whenever I was sitting upright or forward, and it hurt almost zero when I leaned back or laid down.

This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 reports.   A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Caller stated that his close friend who was ER physician (front line worker) and within 24 hours after receiving the COVID vaccine, developed COVID or symptoms of COVID. Patient received the COVID vaccine on 18Dec2020 and the same night patient started with a low grade fever, body aches, chills, muscle pain, shortness of breath, cough, O2 saturation of 80% (hypoxia) and was in the intensive care unit now. Patient swore this was related to the vaccine. This patient tested positive for COVID. He had a CT (computerised tomogram) scan which showed extensive infiltration in the lungs in Dec2020. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 24Dec2020 and then was moved to the ICU 2 days later, on 26Dec2020. Caller thought patient had a positive COVID test at another hospital. Caller did know that tested positive at the current hospital on 26Dec2020 which was done to confirm the previous positive test. Caller thought patient had his first positive COVID test either the same day or the next day after receiving the vaccine. Event of O2 Saturation of 80% / hypoxia was reported as hospitalization from 24Dec2020 and life threatening; infiltration in the lungs and shortness of breath caused hospitalization from 24Dec2020, muscle pain, chills and positive COVID test was reported as medically significant; and other events were reported as non-serious.  Outcome of O2 saturation of 80% / hypoxia and shortness of breath was not recovered, outcome of cough was recovering; and outcome of other events were unknown.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

A 35-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL0140, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021, 9:00AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergies to Amoxicillin, Quinolones, and Sulfa drugs, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12); patient received these medications with two weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12Jan2021, 19:00, just after evening, patient&#39;s throat started feeling itchy and had pins and needles feeling. Gradually the symptoms increased in intensity and in the night of 12Jan2021 (time unspecified), he felt like his throat was swollen. It was also reported that patient woke up today, 13Jan2021 with the same feeling and there is pain on swallowing in the throat. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological association, causality between events odynophagia, pharyngeal swelling and throat irritation and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)  cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pt. walked to a chair outside about 20 feet outside of the injection room after receiving his shot.  He sat down in the chair and within 1-2 minutes the patient fell face down on the floor.  A customer yelled for help and pharmacy staff and the nurse practitioner responded to help. Pt. was passed out but breathing heavily.  We rolled patient to his back and he came to and tried to get up.  We told him to stay flat and assured him he was being taken care of.  The nurse practitioner stated it was a vagal nerve response.  The patient sat up and talked with us and stated this has happened before.   The ambulance response was called and checked patient out and he was released about 30 minutes later.  His blood pressure was normal and patient stated he felt fine.

Common side effects such as chills, headache and severe drowsiness lasted 2 maybe 3 days but the anxious feeling in my chest is still there. Heart palpitations is what I am having and it?s constant. There have been times at work that I can feel my heart beat in my pant legs, temples, wrists and forehead from ordinary stress that I?ve have no issues handling in the past 4 years. Every 30-60 seconds I have to take a deep breath to catch my breath regardless of what I am doing. Suddenly severe drowsiness. I?m sure there?s more that I?m forgetting.

Also developed constant sub-sternal chest pain.  Worse with movement or deep inspiration.  No clear positional component.   CP persisted until he came to the ED today.  Initial ECG showed concave ST elevations lateral leads.  Given his history this was felt to be most consistent with pericarditis.  He received toradol, morphine and SL NTG with near complete relief of the pain.  Repeat ECG showed resolution ST elevations.  Troponin was elevated, peak 9.08 ng/ml.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8734), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26May2021 at 04:10 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol from Dec2020, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from Dec2020 (not related to lifestyle or diet), and ongoing heartburn from Nov2020 (received omeprazole for couple of months, two weeks before vaccination for heartburn or acid reflux, for his ulcer, for GI), H-pylori (patient got two courses of antibiotics for 10 days and diagnosed with H-pylori in January), patient thought maybe the antibiotics harmed his body and allergy to grass (undiagnosed allergy to grass and it was more severe in spring in early summer). No prior vaccinations and no family history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took omeprazole on Jan2021 for heartburn (one pill one day during two-week period before vaccine administration. He took for two month and later had a break from it. He was not taking it lately). On 26May2021, the patient experienced chest and lung pain from the vaccine among additional side effects, severe chest pain on the left side, moderate lung pain on both sides, throat sickness, hard to swallow, hands were really cold, face numbness. swollen inside the throat and burning in lung on both sides, itching in lung on both sides, more like a choking, allergic reaction, more like a pressure in the chest. The patient experienced moderate lung pain on both sides. This was 40 minutes after vaccination. It was moderate. He felt a burning and itching in lungs on both sides. The patient experienced severe chest pain on the left side. Severe chest pain was 15 minutes after lung pain began. It was on the left side, mostly to the ribs, where heart is located. Pain was moderate to maybe severe. Sometimes it was a little bit hard to breathe. It was more like he was afraid to breathe because of the pain. Confirmed there was not issue with his airway. More like a pressure in the chest. As the lung pain was going away then chest pain came in. Dime size pressure. He stated he got sickness in his throat a little bit after. It was hard to swallow. He was not worried about it. He stated he was able to breath and was able to drink water. It was more like a choking. It happened after he left the vaccination site. It was maybe like 20 minutes after he had the vaccination. His hands were really cold as well after. The patient severe chest pain was improved a little bit. The chest pain on left side lasted 25-30 minutes. After that it was kind of resolved. In a couple hours it came back. The reporter stated right now it was coming back, but more lighter. It was not a severe pain (mild to moderate). It was sort of like a sore muscle in the chest. The patient had sickness in throat, when trying to swallow. The face numbness felt right after chest pain. He also felt this one hour ago, maybe on left side. He felt it for a few minutes, but not sure if it was connected. The patient also got two courses of antibiotics for 10 days. His doctor diagnosed with him with H-pylori in January. He thinks maybe the antibiotics harmed his body. He read articles about heart inflammation that lead to myocarditis or something like that. The patient thought that what he was experiencing is maybe an allergic reaction. He read articles about heart inflammation that lead to myocarditis or something like that, kids and young adults experienced chest pain after getting the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. He then explained he also read about 68 cases, among which there were 20 individuals and 2 individuals who died: a 22-year-old female and 35-year-old male. Patient thinks maybe he was experiencing an allergic reaction. No Investigation Assessment. No relevant tests. Outcome of the event Lung pain and hands were really cold was recovered on 26May2021, for chest pain, throat sickness, hard to swallow, more like a choking, hands were really cold, face numbness and more like a pressure in the chest was not recovering while unknown for rest of the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

He sat for several minutes and said he felt fine.

                                                My first COVID19 Pfizer vaccine shot was on 4/05/21. My second was 3 weeks later on 4/26/21.  About 30 hours after my second vaccine on 4/27/21 I started to notice tightness around my lungs/rib cage in the intercostal muscle area. For the next few days the pain increased and I had shortness of breath as well. After a few nights I couldn&#39;t lie down to sleep because of this pain so I had to sit upright to sleep.   On 5/3/21 I went to the doctor at hospital where I was examined and had a lung X-ray as well as a COVID PCR test (it was negative). The PA diagnosed me with &#34;Pneumonia&#34; and I was given antibiotics (cefuroxime and azithromycin) to take for 6-7 days.  I started feeling a little better by 5/6/21 and actually reported here on VAERS with my diagnosis of suspected Pneumonia. On 5/17/21 I had another lung x-ray at hospital and was told my lungs were looking more clear. However, for the next 2 weeks I felt more tired and my poor breathing, a cough with bloody mucus, and more chest/rib cage area pain developed. Despite being a professional runner it became hard to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing really hard and feeling light-headed.   On  5/30/21 I woke up with fairly intense chest pain just under my heart. I was taken to the ER at second Hospital and got a CT scan with contrast that showed a bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with infract. An ultra sound of my heart (normal) and blood panels were performed as well as multiple EKGs. I was given a stomach injection of Lovenox also. That afternoon I was transferred to third Hospital. for overnight monitoring with more EKGs and Lovenox injections. Prescribed blood thinner Pradaxa for 3 months with no known cause of clots that caused this Pulmonary Embolism. Kidney test and Heart appeared normal. Still waiting on genetic testing. Lung infract has caused lasting chest pain and my breathing has yet to return back to normal.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                I was having episodes of dyspnea and non productive cough starting from 1/1/2021. On 1/13/2021 I experienced severe dyspnea and had loss of consciousness for 5 seconds and was found down.  I was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolus  (about 9) which was treated with direct TPA via catheterization. I then recovered in the ICU and transitioned to oral anticoagulation and discharged home on 1/15/2021.

I had a smoke and my lungs started hurting. This is unusual. I laid down for about an hour and when I got back up to get a glass of water, I was short of breath. My lungs feel about a 3 on the pain scale. Planning to just lie down for the night and reassess in the morning how I feel.

While he was there he started feeling lightheaded and unwell. 5 minutes after vaccination, pt was hot, diaphoretic, and went very pale. His eyes started rolling into the back of his head and he was exhibiting shallow breaths. His pupils dilated and he started foaming at the mouth. Pt was lowered to the ground and a full dose of adult epi pen (Lot#0FM406 Exp FEB 2022) was given to the left lateral thigh at 1725. 911 was also called. Pt came to almost immediately. His pupils and breathing returned to baseline. He stayed lying down but was A &amp; O x4. He confirmed that he does not have any allergies, however he has passed out after a vaccine before. Paramedics arrived on scene and took over the encounter. Pt felt much better, however still went with the Paramedics to the ER. Also advised pt to follow up with his PCP in regards to receiving the second vaccine.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

At approx 1540 this nurse was called over by a staff member and was told that this patient was feeling dizzy, hot and nauseous. This patient presented as diaphoretic and pale.  RN&#39;s, came over to the patient and began asking basic demographic info questions, and started to measure his vital signs. This patient denied any heart issues or past medical history. His father was present and was seated next to the patient. We had the patient move onto a cot and we had the patient lay down and we elevated his feet. The patients initial vital signs were: 110/70, HR 56 and O2 99% at 1543. He stated that he felt some shortness of breath but was able to speak to us without difficulty. No wheezing or rhonchi present. We kept the patients legs elevated and provided a cold pack to his head and neck. After approx 10 minutes the patient stated he felt better, but he felt cold and his legs and upper body were shaking. Once we sat him up into a sitting position he stated he wasn&#39;t feeling dizzy. We kept him there for another 10 minutes until he felt better. His vital signs were measured again and his bp was 140/90, HR 91 and O2 level was 99%. The patient denied any difficulty breathing. This nurse advised for the patient and his father to go to the Emergency Room if another episode of this occurs. The patient understood and he walked with his father to their car without any difficulty.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

My heart was racing and I was so weak that I could barely sit up. The following day I could not get out of bed. I also had an intense headache, which is unusual for me since I never get headaches. On the 3rd day I developed dizziness/vertigo. Since those events occurred, I&#39;ve been dizzy 24/7 and had about 25-50% of my normal energy. I cannot drive, I cannot work, I cannot many of my normal daily activities. This has been devastating. It has been over 3 weeks now with these symptoms, and I will probably lose my job this week. I don&#39;t know where to turn. There should have been a safety net for these things.

About an hour later, I experienced slight swelling under my left eye and cheek. A few minutes after, my throat began to have a scratchy feeling and a slight wheezing which was concerning. As soon as I experienced this feeling, I took one Benadryl immediately.

I felt fine afterwards.

The Chest X Ray came back normal, but the D Dimer showed an elevated level and they recommended I go get a CT Scan to check for Blood Clots  I went to NY Presbyterian ER to get a CT Scan with Contrast, which came back clean.  They also did a ECG 12 Lead and Troponin I Test, all came back clean  I was discharged on 3/8, with Hospital potentially diagnosing the issue as Pluerisy.  This could be from a common cold, but also concerned that the vax caused some internal inflammation   Still feeling the sensation on 3/9, have a follow up appointment with GP on Friday 3/12 to go over all tests

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

                                                Received injection at approx. 10:30am. Waited at vaccination site for approx. 30 minutes with no reaction. At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time. In the military...very healthy.

At about 33-35 minutes after injection, my throat started to tickle and I could not stop coughing - even after being given 2 bottles of water and a mint. at about 38 - 40 minutes after injection it started to feel like a lump or a rock was in my throat  At around 12:30 - 1:00 am on the morning of 04/22/2021, I notice there were blisters on my gums - one on my upper left gums, one on my upper right gums and one on my lower right gums

Due to his history, he was vaccinated next to our ambulance with physician and EMS team in attendance. Approximately 5 minutes after vaccination, recipient began complaining of dryness of the throat and feeling a lump in his throat without any compromise in breathing. Approximately 9 minutes post vaccination, he complained of a progression of his swallowing symptoms, swelling and pressure feeling (periorbital and in the malar area) of the face. He did not complain of dyspnea. Due to his symptoms, he was administered 0.3 mL of epinephrine IM at 10:39, followed by diphenhydramine 50 mg IM approximately 1-2 minutes later. Symptoms seemed to remain static, with treatment, with the exception of post-epinephrine shakiness and complaints of tingling of his feet.

                                                At approximately 3:00 pm I was called to the observation area after reports from staff that a patient needed the epi pen due to a reaction from his injection. I proceeded to the area with an epi pen and requested for staff to activate EMS by calling 911. I discovered the patient laying on the ground in supine position, alert and oriented x3, multiple abrasions on forehead and knees. Assessed patient for SOB or any other symptoms to which he replied, ?I feel light headed and my knees hurt.? Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 108/47, O2SAT 97, Pulse 61. Per observation nurse, LVN, patient was sitting in an observation chair chatting with his girlfriend when he fell over face forward to the concrete ground. LVN then called for help and that is when I and vaccine nurse came to assist. Per Nurse , who administered the first dose of Pfizer to pt at 2:55 pm, he proceeded to the observation area a few minutes after his injection. Time of incident reported by  LVN was 3:00 pm. I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS transported patient to Hospital for further evaluation. - MB, RN

                                                After taking my 2nd Shot for Booster on the morning of Friday the 5th of 2021. I ate and hydrated for the day. At home I was resting when standing up I was overwhelmed with dizziness, nausea, sweats, and then the chills and heat hit. My inner core felt frozen. I couldn&#39;t move after standing up and the chills locked every bone in my body I couldn&#39;t breathe. Terrified doesn&#39;t cover how afraid I was at that moment. Teeth chattering, fingers rigid, and my back was solid. After moments in this state, I put on layers of sweaters to warm myself. The outside temperature was 65-70*C. So not that bad. I was in shock and not long after putting on my sweaters. My skin felt like it was sun burned and all the weight of the clothing was painful.  I could not lay down, or even roll on my side for rest. Even standing up made my spin hurt.  The muscles in my lower back seized up and the pain was right in the middle of my spin. (The ER Doctors checked and I do not have kidney stones.) I was fighting 99.3&#43; temp and rising. (This temp is accurate. I have phot evidence.)  There was no sleep that Friday night.  Saturday morning I called the first available chiropractor and went to that appointment at 2pm.  As a new client they don&#39;t want to go all out in the first session, but I was in pain with every breathe.  Hyperventilating and over breathing was causing issues with my head and stomach.  The session was amazing, electro therapy mixed with heavy cracks worked on by a professional did help, but only for a brief period of time. Walking away from the building I was still in more pain than ever.  My dad arrived to take me to the ER at roughly 6pm.   Doctors gave me fluid and anti inflammatory drip. Potassium and Tylenol.   It worked. The pain was unreal and I welcomed anything to end the suffering.

                                                He presented to hospital ED with new onset chest pain.  He reports that he woke up this morning nauseous and he vomited after which he has started developing retrosternal chest pressure and some shortness of breath for which he came to the emergency room for assessment. In the emergency room he was given both a GI cocktail and nitropaste with wheeze the symptoms improved.  He was transferred to a medical center for higher level of care. At present he is essentially symptoms free.  The EKG showed right bundle branch block and all septal myocardial infarction.  The right bundle branch block is new compared to his last EKG.  The initial troponin was mildly increased at 0.18 and BNP was 118. The renal function is normal with a creatinine of 0.8 and the chest x-ray shows bilateral interstitial opacities which might represent pulmonary edema. He remains admitted

                                                After the first dose, I experienced only mild fatigue and a mild headache within a couple hours of the injection. Later within 10 hours, I developed strong injection site direness that affected my sleep but abated within 12 hours. Therefore, I was expecting more or less similar symptoms with the second dose. Instead, I felt absolutely nothing for nearly twelve hours until I fondly felt mild injection site soreness. I went to bed around 1 am. At around 2 am I awoke with such strong chills that they were almost like convulsions. I was sweating and had a headache.  More concerning though was the tachypnea and wheezing. I was wheezing as if I had asthma to the point that my lunch?s were whistling and I found it difficult to take sufficient breaths. This lasted 30 minutes to one hour before a sting enough that I fell asleep again, still with mild left arm soreness, sweating, mild fever, headache and wheezing. When I awoke a few hours later at around 8 am, I was so fatigued that I could not move. I had a mild headache still but the breathing was better without wheezing and now only hampered by frequent belching (passing off the CO2 buildup from the tachypnea most likely). However, I was so exhausted that I lay in bed for another four hours. When I forced myself up to shower and move, I had a sudden severe depressive attack of uncontrollable crying in the shower. I also had body aches throughout the morning. These symptoms are the same or similar to those felt when I had COVID, so I knew them and that they should pass, yet I did not expect them to be so strong  and the tachypnea with wheezing was initially very disconcerting until it began to ease.  By approximately 11 hours later,  all symptoms had passed.

A 38-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 15Apr2021 12:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included loratadine/ pseudoephedrine (CLARIDIN-D). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, administered in arm left on 25Mar2021 04:30 PM (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced chest pains, and short of breath both on 17Apr2021 22:00. Tried to sleep it off. 24 hours, didn&#39;t get better. On 17Apr2021, went to local ER, troponin at 4.6 ng/L. Doctors didn&#39;t believe it, did another blood draw. Went up to 5.0 ng/L. Ambulance to nearby hospital, troponin peaked at 9.9 ng/L. Echo showed decreased blood flow (50%) and EKG was irregular. Angiogram and CT scan show no blood clots or blockages. Patient was a healthy 38 male who was a distance runner. No history of chest pain or heart issues. Doctors determined incident almost certainly related to vaccine. The serious criteria for all events were hospitalization and duration were 2 days. The adverse events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Colchicine received as treatment for the adverse events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID 19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID 19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (COVID antibody blood test): negative on 20Apr2021, Covid test (Nasal Swab): negative on 18Apr2021. The outcomes of events were recovering.

I was unconscious for 30 seconds, and while unconscious my eyes started to role to the back of my head. When I became alert I was on the floor and I couldn?t breathe! While on the floor gasping for air I vomited twice! 911 was called and an EKG was done on site! It showed that my heart rate was low, and I was transported to hospital ER department. Multiple test were done on me and everything came back perfect! No high blood pressure, not a diabetic, and no Permanent head damage.

A 38-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 as second dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2, on an unknown date, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced myocarditis on 05May2021, and in May2021 (reported as started 2 and a half days after receiving the second dose) experienced pleuritic chest pain, difficulty breathing, myalgia, headache, and flu-like symptoms. The patient was hospitalized for the events from 05May2021 to an unknown date. The reporter assessed the events as life-threatening. The adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room. The reporter assessed that the patient&#39;s events were caused by the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible association of the suspect drug administration with the reported events cannot be excluded, due to a plausible temporal relationship. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I was light headed and had a little bit of breathing weirdness. It probably only lasted about 2 minutes. I laid down and all symptoms went away in about a minute.   The only other time I fainted in my life it was from seeing blood shoot out of my body but it wasn&#39;t accompanied by heart flutters.

                                                Same as the first shot, however, the adverse effects started shortly after the 2nd shot (within 2 hours after 2nd shot, vs 12 hours after the 1st shot). The symptoms are as follows: Severe headache, severe fatigue and muscle ache, shortness of breath and mild dizziness.  Muscle pain is more noticeable at joints (knees, shoulder cuffs, ankles).  I probably couldn&#39;t walk more than 2 blocks before having to sit down and catch my breath. I probably can&#39;t stand for more than 5 minutes,  and most definitely not in a shape to be able to work (office /engineering). It is hard to pin point, but I would probably say my mind is foggy and not as sharp. However I can quantify this.  The above symptoms lasted 5 days after the first shot, however,  it took up to 14 days before I recovered from general fatigue.   As for second dose, I am filling this form 5 hours post injection.  Considering the severity and early onset of symptoms (compared to 1st dose) I can predict uneasy days to follow.  Note, I am 178cm, and 76Kgs and do not have health issues. My pain tolerance is much higher than an average person.

                                                I went to the emergency room at Hospital on April 14, 2021,  after experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. After an abnormal EKG, blood tests showed a high troponin level. An ultrasound determined my heart ejection fraction had declined to 35-40 percent. An angiogram was performed that showed no blockages or tears in my heart. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. Over the next 36 hours my troponin level rose to more than 11 before starting to decline. I have prescribed a number of medications for treatment. On April 22 I had a cardiac MRI which confirmed the Myocarditis diagnosis. My heart function has improved to 55 percent and an EKG showed normal rhythm.  I have more tests and follow ups scheduled in the coming weeks.

Felt just like  Pericarditis that I had back in February.  This was confirmed with EKG.  Chest X-Ray unremarkable.    Pericarditis earlier diagnosed on February 16th, assumed by medical professional that likely had COVID at that time based on recurrence after vaccine.  No previous occurrence of Pericarditis prior to Feb 2021

He did not seek medical treatment and it resolved. He called it an anaphylactic reaction. I did not administer the second dose of Pfizer vaccine as a precaution. I told him to seek advice from his doctor and if he chooses to get the second dose, he should get it at a medical facility or doctor&#39;s office.
