A 90-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 16Feb2021 (Lot Number: EL9267) (at age of 90-year-old) as 2ND DOSE SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation, stent placement from 19Jun2020 and ongoing (successful in the descending aorta), and ongoing Heart problems. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in Arm Right on 05Feb2021(Lot: EL9263) (at age of 89-year-old) for covid-19 immunisation. The patient would like to talk to an individual regarding his side effects he has been having since his two COVID vaccinations in Feb 2021. Ten days after the second inoculation on 26Feb2021, he woke in the middle of the night with jaw pain. He was in great pain. The pain went down his left shoulder and back . His wife said that morning that those were signs of heart problems. He does have Atrial Fibrillation, and he had a stent placed 19 Jun 2020. He went to the emergency room where they checked him out for heart problems. He had a clean bill of health. They sent him home, and told him to take Tylenol for the pain. The Tylenol certainly helps. It took whatever number of days for it to subside. It subsided for 2 weeks, but then he developed pain down his right side of his shoulder, and down in his hips. Once again they figured they better get back to the ER. They did EKG and a X-ray.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with his stent. They told him just to continue with Tylenol to control the pain. He went a third time to the emergency room because he was having problems breathing.  The emergency room put him through the COVID entry at Kaiser because of the difficulty breathing. They re did all the previous work, and did a scan of his lung to check for blood clots. He thinks they did that because 6 people died from blood clots from Johnsons and Johnson. They wanted to see if there were blood clots, but there were no blood clots. They told him he needed to make an appointment with his primary who then referred him to a Cardiologist. On 11May2021, he saw his primary doctor who ordered another scan because they found possibly a swollen lymph node on his trachea. The doctor measured that, and said to wait a month to do that again. To see any change in it. On the 26 May 2021, he has his next appointment to get that rechecked. He hasn&#39;t had a comfortable day since this started. He has had pains in different parts of his body that last for 2-3 days and then some place else starts to hurt. His left ankle, right side heel, and shoulders also hurt. The pain  was under control if he takes ibuprofen, but his doctor advised him against too much of that because of his kidneys. It was very effective.  The Tylenol works to some extent, but not like the Ibuprofen. He is just living with it day to day. He can play tennis some days. One day he played tennis and came home with chills. His wife took his temperature and it was 100.3. In the last week and half this has happened two times. After the second shot this has happened probably four times. He has weird fevers for one day with no other symptoms. Ever since 26Feb2021, it has been on a daily basis that some place else hurts. One subsides , but another pain starts up elsewhere. If that is not happening, then his whole demeaner is dead. He is just not comfortable and sitting around he feels like he was wasting what life he has left. He used to be a PE teacher. He has always been in good physical condition. He was 5k and walking 5ks every 4th of Jul. He would compete. He prepared for this 90 birthday/ His goal was to do a 5k in under 60 minutes. He worked out like always , and played tennis 3 days a week to prepare. He also played ball. He likes to walk run 2-3 miles most days. He did his 5k in 52minutes, and he was celebrating. Then ten days later this all started happening. The patient/caller has been tested for COVID, and it was negative. The aches and pains were moving around. He was still having breathing difficulties. Sometimes he can&#39;t talk because of the breathing. It just goes away. If it is something like the tumor or a node on the trachea wouldn&#39;t it be happening all the time? Sometimes he can&#39;t talk because the breathing is bad. It comes and goes. It is more often recently. It is like all the sudden he can&#39;t breath and can&#39;t talk. That started right at the beginning. It has gotten progressively worse. He took Tylenol to help the pain in his body. Nothing has helped his breathing. He tried antihistamines to see if maybe it was hay fever or something , but there was no difference. He didn&#39;t know where to go from here. He was feeling horrible. He was  just waiting on 26 May2021, for the second scan without color of thorax to see those results. The patient said he didn&#39;t have questions. The outcome of events was unknown.

About 3 minutes later the patient complained of not feeling well/right.  His eyes then rolled back in his head and he began to shake. He did slump to the side in his wheelchair.   He was breathing although it seemed a bit labored. He was not responsive verbally when w asked him if he was ok. After about 2 minutes, the episode seemed to end.  He moved and  straightened up. His eyes opened and he was able to answer questions. He complained of feeling tired. He wanted to lay down and he said his stomach was a bit upset. 911 was called while the patient was not responding. They arrived after he awakened. He was given oxygen and eventually placed on a gurney and taken to the ER.

At 1:50 pm the CNA answered his call light and found he had taken himself to the bathroom. She stated that when he went to get back into the bed it was &#34;abnormal&#34; how he was getting into it so she assisted him. At that time he quit breathing and she called a RN into the room immediately. He was found without a pulse, respirations, or blood pressure at 1:54 pm. He was a DNR.

On presentation he was hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen, he was in Afib RVR. He received experimental treatment with plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. He had a AKI in setting of infection that improved, and his lasix was added back. He has CKD3, would recommend re-check cr in 3 days after discharge.  He did develop acute urinary retention that required a foley to be placed. Void trail in hospital was unsuccessful, suspect relatedd to weakness/poor endurance.  Can considner ongoing voiding trails as his health improves and or outpatient urology consult.  Paroxysmal Afib in the setting of viral infection, with fluids and increasing metoprolol rates improved.  Once he recovers from Afib can consider MCOT to evaluate Afib burden, continue ASA     Covid pneumonia Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, from COVID Pneumonia Received convalescent plasma Received Dexamethasone 10 day course  Completed remdesivir 5-day course on 4/4/21  Oxygen Requirement continues at 2 L nasal cannula Inflammatory markers trended down He was vaccinated SECOND INJECTION on 3/26.    Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease stage IV Creatinine improved with IVF did upwardly trend again likley from acute urine retention  Cautiously watch Cr while on  Lasix, consider checking CR/BUN in 3 days Monitor creatinine, avoid nephrotoxins Discharged with foley, continue Flomax. Consider voiding trails at SNF and/or urology consult   Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -new onset Metoprolol tartrate increased during hospitalization patient will benefit from outpatient event monitor to determine A. fib burden once he recovers from Covid, to be arranged by PCP continue aspirin

He was initially admitted for right intertrochanteric hip fracture (following a fall at home) for which he required surgery. Also had bacterial pneumonia and received Zosyn.  He was close to discharge at 1 point but then  had Covid testing done which came back positive.  He gradually worsened from there with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and very poor oral intake.  He had multiple episode of hypoglycemia and required D5. He was made care only but improved on his own and was back on medical Mx. It did not last long and he again became very tachypnic in 60s and hypoglycemic. He was made care again. Pt passed away peacefully with his daughter at the bedside on 3/11/21 at 11 AM Causes of Death: 1. Cardiopulmonary arrest due to reason #2 2. Failure to thrive due to reason #3 3.

The weakness, inability to walk, and shortness of breath lasted in a severe state for 48 hours.  After that, he continued to be unable to walk, suffered weakness and had shortness of breath until he died.  He never recovered the strength and vitality he had prior to the 2nd vaccine.  That 2nd shot shortened his life and killed him.
