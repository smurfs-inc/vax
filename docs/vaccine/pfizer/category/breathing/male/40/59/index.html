A 40-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: left arm) on 18Dec2020 04:15 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy induced asthma, allergies to cats and dust, and occasional seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication included other vaccine/s received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine: first dose of diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular 3-component, tetanus vaccine toxoid (BOOSTRIX, GlaxoSmithKline) administered as single dose via unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: left arm) on 08Dec2020. There were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced persistent shortness of breath and chest tightness starting within a few days after vaccine (24Dec2020). Patient was poorly responsive to her inhalers that she used for asthma (onset date not reported). She rarely needed the, used about once or twice a year). It was constant, but with periods of improvement followed regression. Will likely seek medical evaluation as it&#39;s been over a week now and rather concerning. The patient did not consider the events shortness of breath and chest tightness as serious. Treatment for the adverse events shortness of breath and chest tightness included fluticasone propionate, almeterol (ADVAIR), albuterol, and unspecified anti-allergy medications. Patient did not have covid prior vaccination. Patient was tested for COVID post vaccination wherein patient tested negative for COVID via Covid test rapid on 30Dec2020. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of shortness of breath and chest tightness was not recovered and unknown for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of BNT162B2 to the events shortness of breath , chest tightness and asthma aggravated cannot be excluded.

Later that night, about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild wheezing for less than 5 minutes, but believe this was likely due to allergies and associated postnasal drip rather than the vaccine.  The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

Around 5 minutes after my injection I could feel my throat swelling. I alerted the nurse and took a Benadryl tablet. The swelling stayed consistent and I was able to breathe so I waited for an hour and then went home. When I arrived home I felt and increase in the swelling so I took another Benadryl. The swelling slightly decreased but was still present for 5 hours post shot and then disappeared.  The only other reaction I had was metallic taste in my mouth and extremely sore arm where injection was given for 2 days.

                                                I was fine for a while but on the 10th (4/9) day after taking my first shot I started feeling my throat swell up. The next day (4/10), my body shut down. I was in bed and slept most of the day. My throat was sore and swollen and had general fatigue. The third day (4/11), I brought myself to a medical clinic and got a strep test, negative; rapid covid test, negative. I also received the PCR test which turned up negative a few days later. My throat culture results are still pending. 4th &amp; 5th day I was still coughing with a sore throat and fatigue. Day 6 is today and I am still fatigued with a sore throat but I seem to have turned a corner. I am able to get up and walk a little at a time.   This may not be related to the shot but it was close enough where I felt the need to report it. I am scheduled to take my 2nd Pfizer shot on 4/20 and am curious if I should push it back or not.

He was very winded. On March 7, we skipped exercise. On March 8, patient tried to do simple stretching exercise, and couldn&#39;t do it. He got winded and shaky. On March 9, he was seen at an urgent care where he was told he had an inverted T wave on his EKG and a very fast heart rate (125 resting pulse). He was told to not exercise and to make an appointment with a cardiologist. On March 9, I called the urgent care clinic to ask questions about monitoring his blood pressure and when to seek more medical care. I spoke with Dr, who prescribed Atenolol. Around 4:30 pm on

Consultation 1 Comments discussed with  RPh.  He will come to ER to obtain additional information from patient.  This is the hospital&#39;s first presumptive Pfizer vaccine reaction. ? Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.

We are following up with a neurologist tomorrow.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 40-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Apr2021 08:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0171) (at age 40 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, carpel tunnel, absent vas deferens, all from unspecified dates. No COVID prior to vaccination. He underwent Covid test post vaccination (nasal swab) on 29Apr2021 with negative result. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified prescribed and store-bought medications. No other vaccines in four weeks. On 28Apr2021 22:00, the patient experienced chest pains and shortness of breath testing of EKGs, echo, CT scan, and cardiac cath show- NStemi heart attack showing from damage to heart caused by blood clot. No problems with arteries or existing with heart. Also, lower lobe of left lung shows collapsed. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The events were considered serious: hospitalization (2 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Treatment included blood thinners- apixaban (ELIQUIS) and metoprolol. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                Phizer shot 1 of 2 in the left arm on Thursday 5/6.  I arrived home 45 minutes after the shot was administered and went to the bedroom as my heart rate continued increasing until it was racing non-stop. As my rate increased, so did my breathing until it became rapid and shallow.  It is difficult to describe how fast my heart was beating.  The rapid heart rate and shallow breathing reminded me of how my breathing changed when I summited a 5800-meter volcano and there was insufficient oxygen near the peak.  As my pulse increased I became weak and fell asleep, or fell unconscious.  I awoke at 11:00 PM and my breathing was normal however my heart continued racing for an additional hour until midnight.  I have experienced no other side effects except heart rate and breathing.

A 40-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0164) administered in left deltoid via an unknown route of administration on 16Apr2021 at 12:50 pm as 1st dose single for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that that he received the vaccine in his left arm, the bicep muscle, or above the bicep. He states the muscle on the shoulder area. Patient states that asthma was in the lungs and chest. He has had mild intermittent asthma and gets it 4 times a year. There was no prior Vaccinations, no adverse events within 4 weeks. Medical history included asthma (patient was diagnosed 30 years ago), allergic to shellfish. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Apr2021 patient experienced is there any correlation between the delated anaphylaxis and ingredient, throat tightening with difficulty breathing (Throat tightness and dyspnea), less of a passageway, fair amount of coughing/dry cough swelling in the neck area and fatigue. On 19Apr2021 at 10:15 HCP indicated tracheitis. The patient states that he got the vaccine on 16Apr2021 at 12:50 pm and isn&#39;t sure exactly when the swelling started because he got a little fatigued. Patient states that it was about 3-5 hours after and at a certain point he noticed it. It was reported that a half an hour to an hour later patient throat started to tighten, it gets triggered by certain stimuli, steam and vocalization, and rubbing the area. patient states that he could reproduce the issue if he rubs the area, the frequency has decreased, and in that case, it has improved. It was reported that patient was diagnosed with tracheitis on 19Apr2021 at 10:15 and it was still ongoing, or the effects of it are. Patient states that what he feels in the front of his throat near the trachea and up a little further was inflammation. Patient gets the symptoms of the tightening of the throat, and it is inflamed there is less area to breath. Patient states that his understanding of the tightening of the throat and dry cough are all symptoms of the tracheitis. It was reported that the first symptom experienced after the injection (at least 2-3 -4 hours), patient had fatigue first then probably a half an hour to an hour later the swelling started. patient believes the fatigue has gone away, but not 100 percent sure. patient states that there are times he has felt fatigue and is not 100 percent of the cause. patient states that if he does feel fatigue, he assumes it because of the tracheitis. patient states that these events happen when he needs to get area in his throat, and it might cause the fatigue. patient states that the coughing is parallel with the throat tightening, when he wants to open his airway or pass way the coughing seems to occur. Patient states he gets relief or a more open passageway and the coughing reflex or coughing bouts are less, when he gets the tightness of the throat or the inflammation he sort of goes into coughing. The outcome of the event for hcp indicated tracheitis was not recovered and unknown for the other events, whereas the outcome of the event fatigue was recovered.   Follow up were needed, further information has been requested.  07May2021: Follow-up spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer.

                                                I was awoken from sleeping on the morning of Good Friday at 4:00 am. i had a very sharp pain at the front of my left shoulder that went about halfway down my left arm. Additionally, I couldn&#39;t breath - it was very painful to attempt to fully fill my lungs. This condition lasted for about 45 minutes as I tried changing positions in bed to make the pain change (either worse or less) but it was consistent and would not go away.  At that time my wife and I thought I may have been having a heart attack so we went to the Emergency Room.

                                                Following the vaccination on 2/23/21, Pt had fever, chills, fatigue the first two days. On the third and fourth days, he added diarrhea and headache to those symptoms.  He felt awful over the weekend and spoke to his doctor on Monday, 3/1.  The doctor began him on steroids and ivermectin. Over the next 24 hours his breathing began to worsen. He entered the hospital on Tuesday, 3/2, for supplemental oxygen. Things continued to get worse. He was intubated and put on a ventilator on 3/6/21 and ultimately spent 13 days in a coma. He was extubated on 3/19/21 but then had seizures on 3/20/21 and had to be reintubated to secure his airway. Pt was taken back off the ventilator on 3/24/21. He suffered vocal cord paralysis and ultimately wound up with both a PEG tube and tracheotomy. He was discharged from the hospital after 43 days and then spent 10 days in an inpatient rehab center. He continues to deal with vocal cord issues, tracheal stenosis, nerve damage in his neck and shoulder, muscle atrophy, and damaged lungs.

                                                The time of the schedule appointment was for 3:00pm at the local Pharmacy).  Once the vaccine was injected into my left arm, I was placed into a different seating placement, to be observe for any signs of side-effects that may occur form the injection.  This seating area also displayed a digital clock to notify how long each patient must be stationed for (each station is registered for each patient to wait approximately 15 minutes after injection).  Once placed in the seating area and the clock was started to examine my treatment, within the six minutes of observation, the following signs occurred:  Rapid-Heart Rate, Short and Shallow Breathing, Sweaty Palms including Hot Flashes (lasting 4 seconds).

A 40-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 13Apr2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 40-years-old) as single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]). The patient stated that it was just a standard rescue inhaler 100 mcg. The patient was vaccinated on 13Apr2021 at 08:00 and within 5 minutes his blood pressure went up to 160 and heart rate went up to 130, so they called paramedics over, who were already on site and did pulse check and blood pressure check until they knew what heart rate, blood pressure and oxygenated blood was. They did not allow him to leave for an hour because it was so highly elevated, he felt so dizzy and very disorienting. His friend dropped him home because he could not drive, there was no way he could drive. After an hour the blood pressure got back down to 140 and heart rate was still about 120, it was lower, so he went home and immediately lay down and rest the entire day. He was just physically ill and experienced chills, fever, sleep sweat, extremely tired, strangely no arm soreness at all. He got every other possible side effect and that lasted until 01:30 in the morning, after he throw up, he was finally able to get some sleep. He took rest the entire day, sleeping off and on, unable to eat and actually zero desire to eat, rapid heart rate, sweating, and occasional shortness of breath. He used the rescue inhaler as treatment, that was probably because he laid on his back for so long and also probably just post-nasal drip into lungs. At 01:30 in the morning, he throw up the water he had drank all day and felt a bit better. It was probably because he did not eat all day. He slept until noon and didn&#39;t went to work because he felt malaise, general fatigue, his arm didn&#39;t hurt. He didn&#39;t feel great on the day of reporting, but it was not like the previous day. He had to go to the emergency room, as his mom kept pushing him to go and he was like not going. He had not eaten anything on the day of reporting, so he was looking for something to (incomplete sentence). The patient took 1 gm of Tylenol (over the course of maybe 14 hours) on 13Apr2021 and was advised not to take Advil for whatever reason. The patient underwent blood volume the previous month which was normal and no STDs. He was negative for COVID. That&#39;s why he felt okay with vaccine and then before that he did a PCR test which was also negative. The patient have been in 11 countries in the previous year and might have undergone 20 PCR test. He was kind of scared taking the second shot. The outcome of all the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Dyspnea with exertion; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 40-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EJ1685), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 08Jan2021 at the age of 40-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac condition, unspecified; high cholesterol; both from an unknown to an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EJ1685) on 18Dec2021 in right arm for COVID-19 Immunisation. On an unspecified date of Jan2021, 1-2 weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine the patient began to experience dyspnea with exertion. It persisted and was not present before he got the vaccine. The patient has a cardiac condition, but stated that this felt different. This case was reported as serious due to medical significant. The event resulted in physician office visit - cardiologist seen for patient&#39;s dyspnea with exertion, but no emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: negative in 2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal in 2021, stress echocardiogram: negative in 2021, lab work: negative in 2021. The outcome of event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the event dyspnea with exertion mostly represented intercurrent condition in this patient with cardiac condition, unrelated to Bnt162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I felt hot and sick to my stomach. I couldn&#39;t breathe. I took my mask off and fanned myself. I started to feel dizzy and then I fell to the floor and passed out. The paramedics did an ekg and thought I was having a heart attack. They rushed me to the Emergency Room and they performed more tests. The tests showed their was nothing wrong with my heart previously.

I felt like I had heart palpitations, then a tingling feeling in my left arm. After the second shot, I felt like my balance was off if I laid down or looked down and then pulled my head up. That went away after the first day.  Starting the following day, I had some chest pain over my heart, and at times, I would have a burning sensation in my heart. At times, I also felt a tingling down my left arm (sometimes out of nowhere). I would be very short of breath. These symptoms were on and off for the first two weeks after I took my shot. They have since completely gone away.

Worst I&#39;ve ever felt in my adult life, like my whole body was rebelling against me.  Long-term (for roughly 10 days after both shots): Serious shortness of breath, irregular and very high heartbeat, extreme fatigue. Couldn&#39;t do any physical activity without immediately becoming out of breath (normally very healthy and active). Heart would race unpredictably, reaching 120 bpm (normal resting for me is 60-70). General malaise. Felt more like 80 years old than 40. Was unable to do normal physical activity and work for weeks.  Feeling better overall, but still sometimes feel like I get tired unusually easily and heart behaves strangely now and then.

( what I mean by that is I was aware of my breathing and had to knowingly take breaths it was like I had been under water and just come up for air) I don&#39;t remember the exact time maybe another minute or so, my heart started to race. This All went on for about 45 Minutes. When this first happened the Pharmacist told me that what was happening was common with vaccinations and had nothing to do with the covid 19 vaccination, I asked for the nurse that had provided the vaccine to me and was told she went to lunch. So there was no healthcare professional there to help me. The pharmacist just had me sit in a chair and told me to sit there until I felt better. This happened for both injections. I have never experienced this type of reaction with any other vaccine in my life.

                                                Approximately seven days following second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine, I began experiencing heart palpitations, elevated heart rate, chest pressure, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and dizziness.  Multiple &#34;episodes&#34; each day would occur without warning, did not relate to physical activity, or any other stimulus - would just happen throughout the day, often multiple times per hour.  Even to this day, more than 90 days following the second dose of Pfizer, there are multiple times each day when I feel chest pressure, heart palpitations, and slight shortness of breath.  It is not as common, or as severe as it was early on, but some symptoms remain.

                                                The 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine was injected on May 3rd, 2021 at a clinic. Minor arm ache, fatigue, fever/chills felt for approx. ~1day post vaccination and then felt back to normal. Around day 3 post vaccination felt sudden, sharp, stabbing pain within chest cavity which forced me to take shallow, rapid breaths to avoid triggering pain. Lasted a few minutes before subsiding. Following day or so pain returned as a dull, diffused pain and was felt intermittently for several weeks. Generally I run fairly often for fitness, however activity level was reduced due the ongoing chest pain. Wanted to resume normal activity levels, but decided to consult a Doctor for peace of mind due to pain taking so long to resolve. Scheduled virtual appointment (06/24/21) who advised an ER visit due to it being a potentially risky chest issue, and the fact that they could run the appropriate tests to diagnose it relatively quickly. Walked over to a nearby ER that afternoon and was hospitalized for 1 night, who diagnosed an &#34;Unprovoked VTE&#34; with a &#34;Pulmonary Embolism&#34; in Right lung. Was treated with Lovenox injections at hospital and currently taking Eliquis medication.  As a side note:  my brother (43yrs old) who lives in another country, was administered the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 05/24/2021 and subsequently fell ill, went to the ER twice and was eventually diagnosed with VTE/Bilateral PE. He is also currently taking Eliquis medication.

                                                I experienced similar symptoms the day before the first vaccine - (Just the pain in the chest- like something sticking in my chest. More severe stuff was experienced after the second vaccine.  After second vaccine, I had pain in my chest. I had a dull ache - like a broom stick stuck in chest - sometimes front and sometimes back and sometimes both. Goes up my spine into my neck sometimes. Sometimes it comes with shortness of breath. One point when it went down my left arm and into my hands. Dull pain. I have gone to medical center - Urgent Care twice and two different doctors and they haven&#39;t found anything yet. I woke up gasping for air - one time last weekend. That lasted for two hours - I was only getting 50% of breath when I breathed in. Today I woke up at 6 am (two hours earlier for me) and again had shortness of breath.  The doctors have no idea what is going on. I have never had anything like this before. I&#39;m not particularly stressed so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anxiety like one doctor suggested. It&#39;s very physical and disturbing so I doubt it&#39;s anxiety. Muscular - Skeletal relaxant to take - and that didn&#39;t help and I stopped taking it because it didn&#39;t feel good to stay on it.

                                                On Saturday July 3rd I noticed tightness in my chest, lightheadedness, and ringing in my ears. On Sunday, July 4th, I still had the lightheadedness, tightness in my chest, rapid heartbeat, and it was more difficult to breath unless I was sitting a certain way.  On Monday, July 5th I had severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, fluttering and pounding heart, when I took a deep breath I would feel my heart pounding but at a much slower rate and then it would go back to normal beats, severe ringing in the ears, extreme tiredness. This lasted for about 1.5 hours and I went back to bed and when I awoke 4 hours later my heart seemed to beat fine. Chest pain lightened up a bit, but breathing is still difficult. I?m very healthy and have not had any health issues. The heart issue this morning was so bad that I?m not sure if I should get the second dose. If things worsen, I will contact my doctor. I?m hoping that it goes away soon and this will be alleviated on its own, but I?m really worried about getting the second dose even though I want it.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

Day after the shot I had pretty severe body aches and exhaustion that lasted for two full days and lingered for a third day although not as severe.  It?s now a week since the last vaccination shot and I went for my first run since the vaccination.  I regularly run about 5 miles 3x a week in the mornings.  On this run,; which was at about 75% of my normal pace,  my lungs felt very heavy with very labored breathing, having to stop and catch my breath periodically.  I eventually had to stop at mile 3.

                                                30-35 minutes after injection, while I was driving home, I felt some minor difficulty swallowing., but no impediment to breathing or speaking.  I rerouted to a plaza with a grocery store and urgent care clinic, and bought some Benadryl and took it at about 2:55PM.  I waited 20 minutes in the parking lot before deciding I was safe to drive home. When I read about the possibility of a biphasic reaction, where my throat could close up again later, I went to a Clinic (5:40PM walk-in appointment with NP), and they could not treat me, and advised me to go to the Emergency Room. I initially decided to just go home, but went to the Emergency Room out of an abundance of caution at around 7PM.  Dr.  gave me a prescription for an epi pen and prednisone, just in case symptoms worsened.  They did not, and I did not use either drug.  The throat swelling started around 2:45PM and worsened for about half an hour. It remained steady (no airway constriction, no difficulty taking pills or drinking water) without getting worse, and started to subside around 5PM.  By the time I woke up this morning (3/31), I don&#39;t think there is any lingering swelling.  I can feel a very slight lump in my throat, but I can&#39;t tell if that is a very small amount of residual swelling or just hyper-vigilance based on yesterday&#39;s experience.  Note: This swelling feeling is identical to my memory of what I felt when I was diagnosed as allergic to penicillin in 2000 or 2001. Back then, the only &#34;treatment&#34; was to immediately stop taking penicillin (and to never take it again), based on a phone call with my doctor&#39;s office.  I did have a strong immune response after that (102° fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain), but I don&#39;t consider that an adverse reaction.  This report is focused on what appeared to be a mild anaphylactic reaction.

It was very uncomfortable and made it difficult to swallow  and felt like a &#34;lump in my throat&#34;.  I asked an onsite nurse if this was a common reaction, and she offered medical attention.  I denied it because it was not getting worse.  She gave me a bottle of water and it seemed to help it a bit while drinking.  But, quickly returned after water was swallowed.  I was monitored for 30 minutes as recommended.  The tightness remained for 1 hour post vaccine injection and disappeared as quickly as it started.  I fear the second dose may be worse.

Within ten minutes, started having congestion in chest (rattles). This caused strong bouts of coughing with pain radiation through my lungs. I then started vomiting (x3). I started feeling fatigued so I went to lie down, when I had a cold chill. At 3:00 pm, my temp was 102 F. At 3:15, it was 102.5 F, and then crested at 103 F at 3:30. In the past five hours, the only symptom to subside was vomiting; all the others are still present with my current temp 102.1 F at 8:41 pm.

He has multiple tests run at the hospital. They doctor believes it is vasculitis that has resulted from patient getting the covid vaccine.

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

                                                About six hours after receiving my shot, my arm became extremely sore, as to be expected.  Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

                                                initially began as what felt like jolts to my chest area from inside my chest over five days beginning on March 31, 21 @ 1:20am; next on April 01, 2021 @ 12:02am; then April 02, 2021 @1:02am; then April 03, 2021 @ 1:36am; and on April 04, 2021 @ 2:46am. I ended up in the emergency room the afternoon of Sunday March 04, 2021 with severe chest, abdominal, and intestinal pain. I followed up with doctors on April 05, 2021; April 09, 2021; and April 28, 2021 with continued painful symptoms described below. All they has done so far is 1) took a chest X-ray, 2) taken blood, and 3) referred me to a sleep laboratory.  The X-ray and blood work came back negative per ER.  Symptoms: 1. Inability to sleep. most nights feels as if I just drank five cups of coffee before bed. When I am able to fall asleep, pain and/or jolts coming from inside my trunk/core area wake me up within about an hour.  2. Constant pain coming from my chest, abdomen, and intestines. Intestinal and abdominal pain (gut wrenching, pain/burning sensation, cramps). At times feels like radiation or waves/currents are passing through my intestines/trunk. I wake up with intestines feeling sore. I also have discomfort when I eat or drink something the following morning. Also, my trunk/core area feels tight all day and night. I constantly feel a burning sensation in my chest and gut areas. The discomfort in my chest area (tightness, burning sensation) with occasional burst of pain the size of a nickel that comes from the left side of my chest and underneath my rib cage.  3. Limbs twitch/jerk on their own (both hands, both feet, neck, both shoulders, both legs, fingers) during the day and during the night. tingling sensations in legs.  4. ringing in the ears with headaches. 5. Woke up from sleep due to both nostrils getting clogged while I slept; woke up gasping for air.  6. Penis no longer has the same sensation and difficulty with erection.

These were captured on an EKG during a VA disability exam, and started shortly after providing a blood sample (I&#39;m nervous with needles).  Previous day (1st day after vaccination) I had a fever of 101.5 F and was fatigued.  Suspect the stress of the fever, immune response, and then blood sample caused a stress event that triggered an abnormal heart rhythm.  Palpitations not accompanied by light headedness or shortness of breath, so no immediate medical care directed.  Episodes of palpitations continued for 4 days, but have mostly disappeared since.

We came home early.  Motrin helped a little.  I keep getting worse I went to my doctor, and they did an x-ray and EKG which both came back normal.  Those were done on May 20th.  By the 23rd I couldn&#39;t walk with chest pain.  The cardiologist did a scan of my heart, and they found a small left sided pleural effusion.  They still do not know why I have that pleural effusion.  They check my labs which I had a small elevated inflammatory lab.  Over the next few days after that it went way, and I was able to go back to my normal activities.   I have not had problems since.

A 42-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration at age of 42 years on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at 14:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. No family medical history relevant to AEs. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced new onset atrial fibrillation (AFib) since 27Apr2021 and hospitalized form 29Apr2021, myocarditis/ Inflammation of heart (2021), pericarditis (2021), and pericardial effusion (2021) after receiving second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Patient sought medical treatment and was hospitalized twice, the first time being 29Apr2021. The patient was still dealing with issues and went into hospital 27Apr2021 (as reported). Since then, he has been going back and forth to hospital and was admitted twice for the same issues. He was diagnosed with Afib and inflammation of the heart. Reporter just wanted to know who needs to talk to because it seemed to be vaccine related. Patient has had to take time off of work and reporter has had to take time off work to take care of him. Patient stayed a week for the first AFib hospitalization. He got out of the hospital (2021) and was at home for a week. That Friday, he went back and was hospitalized for another week (2021). That admission was for both AFib and inflammation of the heart. They saw the inflammation the first time, but it was not a lot and said it was probably normal because of the AFib. When he went back for follow up, he had a significant amount of inflammation and fluid around the heart (2021). He was still dealing with it.  He had another issue with going to ER and this was Friday before last. He went in for difficulty breathing (2021) and was told he had more fluid around the heart. He was not admitted for that one. They gave him more medication to control the fluid. Reporter later stated it was prednisone and she did not have a dose, lot or expiration. She then said the dose was increased after he went for follow up and had more fluid.  The first time patient was taken to the emergency they could not find anything and the next day, she (reporter) called 911 from her home and saw that he was experiencing some cardiac issues and saw that he was admitted and told he had AFIB. When she called 911 from her home, they transported by ambulance to (#) Hospital in (#), (#) and that was when he admitted and diagnosed with AFIB. Since # was out of their network, he was transferred to # that same evening or day to # and he was there about a week. Then he was released after a week and still had a hard time breathing and walking a few steps with trying to catch his breath and had chest pain and was very tired (2021). Then he went to a follow up that Friday after being released. Unknown doctor in (#) and then he was readmitted at the follow up appointment to #. He was in the hospital for a week that time as well. He was discharged and they prescribed him medication and then he came back home on medication and he has been on several medications. The one to reduce inflammation, starts with a P and she cannot remember name. He finished it and went to a follow up. After he finished medication, he was experiencing side effects (2021) such as chest pain, difficulty breathing and tightness of chest. She then remembered it was Prednisone that he was on, unknown dose, and it is in pharmacy vial with no lot or expiration. There was no seal, and count size is unknown. He no longer has any left. He went to the ER in (#) because he was experiencing the same symptoms. They saw more fluid collecting and put him on the same medication but a higher dosage of Prednisone. This dose is 10mg, 4 tablets by mouth daily.  It was also in a pharmacy vial with no lot or expiration. This was where he was now. He has been out of work and so has reporter. The patient had MRI, XRays, Echo, Blood Test and was still doing blood test (in 2021). He has to go back this week. Everything came back as unknown for what caused this. The outcome of events myocarditis/ Inflammation of heart and AFib was recovered/resolved with sequel in 2021, of other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                On March 24 I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I experienced side effects almost immediately. By the time I got to the resting/observation area I felt that the site of the injection got really warm and I became dizzy/lightheaded and started to feel heavy on the chest and little problem in swallowing and breathing. I was taken to the paramedics on site, they checked my blood pressure (which a little high 150/90), oxygenation, pulse, and EKG (which were normal). It did not became too bad after and was allowed to come back home.  However, the heavy chest and swallowing problem lasted for three days. The heaviness in the chested turned into a sensation of feeling like my trachea or the anything under the sternum area was behind strangled. Although I felt like this my breathing and swallowing was almost normal. Every now and then when I swallowed I felt some pain but I could withstand it.

He had a sensation that he could not get an adequate breath. He says this started about fifteen minutes after the shot and observation had been done. He was assessed at 5:55pm on Friday (4/23/21). The pt had his vitals done at the area of injections. He was found to be stable. The pt walked under his own power to the medic clinic. There he was placed on a stretcher and vitals performed again. He was given a epic-pen injection in the left thigh, per author. This was a 6:35pm, approximately. He had no adverse effects from the epinephrine shot, with vitals still monitored. An ambulance arrived, report given and he was to be taken to the medical center for further observation.

                                                About 10 minutes after first dose (lot EN 6202, 2/25/21), briefly felt very flush in the face and faint. That passed quickly. Then had extreme burning sensation near injection site for about a minute. Did not report this at the time or before the second vaccine for fear of not being given the second injection.  About 10 minutes after second dose, suddenly realized it was difficult to breathe. Removed mask. Started to feel better after a few minutes, replaced bottom, more breathable mask (did not report to observers). Was urged to leave vaccination site due to backlog of patients, so walked back to car. Began to feel pretty out of it (faint again, plus heart racing) on the way back to the car. Considered getting the shuttle back to the injection site, but instead sat in the car until it passed. About 25 minutes after the vaccine, started feeling very hot all over. 30-40 minutes after the vaccine, all reactions seemed to have passed and drove home without incident.

                                                I had an extremely sore body and couldn?t lift my left arm over my head (I have some should problems anyway, but it made it worse). I had a slight headache, but it wasn?t too bad at that point (maybe about 9:30pm). By 12:30am I was feeling pretty crummy in a general sense and decided to go back to bed (I work nights and normally stay up, even on my nights off). I ended up with severe chills and shivering and shuddering by 1:30am. My legs were so restless and I was shuddering so hard I gave myself charlie horses. By 2:30am I started to warm up but because especially nauseated as I got warmer and warmer. I tried to sleep off and on, but ended up in a chair sitting up and dozing with a bucket in case of getting sick. I was panting heavily for some reason. It felt like it was making the nausea less severe (I also sipped on an Alka-Seltzer and took a meclizine). For three hours I was panting and trying not to vomit. Then I kind of settled down and got an hour or two of sleep, still extremely sore and by this time my head was pounding severely. I got up at 6:30am to take my Mirilax in orange juice (I forgot to mention I take a magnesium supplement and senna on a semiregular basis, as well). The combination of Mg, senna, and OJ didn?t sit well. By about 7:30am I began to get the chills again, but it only lasted about a half hour. Again, an episode of nausea after, but more Alka-Seltzer. I tried to eat small amounts of plain salty tortilla chips, but it didn?t help. It?s now 8:20am and the nausea seems to have passed.

A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I thought nothing of the shortness of breath as I am asthmatic. The next couple of days I felt completely drained, fatigued. Ten days later I have partial facial paralysis. I saw the emergency physician at the hospital who prescribed prednisone, acyclovir, over the counter eye drops, and an eye patch to wear at night.

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

                                                1st shot 4/13, no issue with injection site. About a week later had trouble breathing, chest pain, felt like lungs were hurting in my back, weak, tired, couldn&#39;t catch my breath when i went upstairs and almost passed out. 2nd shot 5/04, felt pain at injection site (that was expected), that night started to get a bad headache and got worse and worse. Next morning, whole body aching, upper body, lower back, bad headache, Left underarm (lymph) swollen. 2nd day slight headache, neck ache, left underarm swollen. That night had rash on arms, chest, and stomach. 3rd day, nighttime rash arms, chest, stomach. Still red where band aid was over injection site. Over a week later still have redness shape of band aid, Seems I have sensitive skin since the 2nd covid shot. 10 days after 2nd shot I still have redness the shape of the Band Aid on my left arm. Got a red spot on my nose (looks like Rosacea). 4 weeks later, still have a red spot on my nose. I have itchiness between fingers left hand, on my face left side, neck, arms (left wrist, right arm in places) redness on chest, and rashes on back, left buttocks, and itchiness on legs. i noticed that it gets worse at night. As far as i know i did not get the Covid Virus, i did the rapid test and regular test and both were negative. But i was very sick with my stomach and had issues breathing in late 2019 and again early 2020, took medication (antibiotics) both times.   I had to write on this form over and over again kept getting frozen with error from the PDF. Even if I hit OK, it keeps popping up and does not let me finish, so I can imagine that lots of people gave up, like I may. Pfizer 4/13/2021 EW0162. After 5pm Pfizer 5/04/2021 EW0170. After 2pm

                                                Would occasionally have difficulty catching my breath while not doing anything.  I occasionally felt my heart flutter or it would possibly skip a beat.  Mild chest pain below above the sternum but I get that feeling from my Eosinophilic Esophagitis.  I&#39;ve become more concerned recently as I almost fainted once on 5/19 while working at my computer.  I&#39;ve had two other instances of feeling faint, most recently occurring on 5/27.  I historically have had no heart issues and can ski and hike all day and feel great so this recent change has been concerning.  After reading articles on the covid vaccines I realized that my symptoms are similar to the heart related issues and took ibuprofen when I felt additional chest pressure.  That has helped to alleviate the pressure at least.

                                                I was driving home from my town to another town. About 15 mins I thought I had to take leak and my groin area was warming up on the inside and then it started to burn up on the inside and it was painful I was thinking what could have caused and it then I realized I had the pfizer vaccine and then I have implant all of sudden I loss use of arms and it took about 20 mins for me to get use in them and then they started to burn up on the inside. Later on that night I started to cough really bad and my lungs had a hard time keeping me breathing and then I knew I had got the covid from the shot and it was much worst than the actual covid.  This was the first dose of the pfizer that I got these reactions and plus I heard about how the vaccine has been sterlizing  people from having kids. I knew that the pfizer vaccine is 100% unsafe for anybody to take and that it was a bad batch or wrong vaccine. But I am letting you know that you need to keep money set aside for damages from the vaccine. But please do not be like the other states giving people money, guns, trucks for getting the vaccine. I am warning people not to get it because I almost die in the first dose of the pfizer vaccine.

I thought it would go away but by 5/23 I had partial paralysis on the right side of my face. Fearing a stroke I went to the ER and after a full battery of tests I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The symptoms worsened for a few days and I was unable to close my right eye, had difficulty breathing out of my right nostril and both eating and drinking were difficult because my lips would not close fully. The symptoms stabilized and then finally began to improve after steroid and antiviral treatment for a week, then on to regular aspirin.

A 44-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0167, Expiry date: UNKNOWN, NDC number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29May2021 11:15 as a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, illness from Feb2020 to an unknown date, whole family was sick in February, palpitations from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. History and investigation included &#34;he said he had nothing to add during that time. But about a year ago he had gone to the emergency room for a heart attack scare. he thought, because this was when COVID first started happening, his whole family was sick in February and they would not test them at that time because they had not been to China and they never found out if they had it but he ended up getting tested for COVID when he was sick like 6 months later and then that went away and he started having heart palpitations and then after that he thought he would get a COVID antibody test and that came back negative, they told him by the time he got the antibody test, they told him he could have had it but it is not showing up on their antibody rapid test thing. He confirms this all occurred last year in 2020, he thinks it was almost a year ago. He would be sitting on the couch and his heart started racing like crazy. He did not know what that was all about&#34;. He said he had no discomfort at all. Concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in 2021 patient experienced it was like he was catching pneumonia but then his nose was running, neck spasms, blood pressure, clarified as low blood pressure, tired, he got really sick, severe congestion, like bad stuff in his chest and lungs, it was like he was catching pneumonia but then his nose was running, on an unspecified date in 2021 severe allergies, on 29May2021 rapid heart rate, really bad chest pains, stuff in his throat/weird stuff on his throat , cough, on an unspecified date in May2021 vomit, nausea, on an unspecified date in May2021, gasping for air, on an unspecified date interrupted his sleep. Caller received his first dose and was experiencing symptoms such as rapid heart rate and neck spasms and blood pressure. He was too tired to go to the emergency room. He had the weird cough and also stated he had weird stuff on his throat and severe allergies. Regarding his second dose, he wanted to receive but he wanted to know if he could receive a half dose. He also had really bad chest pains and he was going to go to the emergency room but he was too tired to even go. The other reason for calling, he was trying to find out because he was afraid to take the second dose, he wanted to know if he could take a half dose or something, he was trying to find out what he should do. Severe allergies, caller clarified it was like severe allergies or like hay fever kind of, but it was different. Rapid heart rate: He said this began happening the same day as the dose was given, 29May2021, 4 hours after he got the shot. It was not ongoing, it lasted about a day. The rapid heart rate went away the next morning, it stopped doing the crazy things it was doing the next morning, 30May2021. He confirmed that has recovered completely. The chest pain coincided with the rapid heart rate. It went way the same time as the rapid heart rate. It seemed like they both would come and go until the next morning, He confirmed that had recovered completely. He said then the low blood pressure was going on too. It was like it interrupted his sleep, he did not know how to explain it, like he had low blood pressure or like his heart would stop beating and he would wake up gasping for air. It was kind of like a nauseous feeling, he wanted to vomit. It happened with the low blood pressure and was mostly when he was sleeping and a little through the day, the nausea he means, it lasted about a day and a half. The nausea went away on the 30May or the 31May he cannot remember for sure. The cough and stuff in his throat began at the same time the heartbeat stuff started and the cough went away after 2 days. He felt pretty good for about 3 days and then he got really sick, with severe congestion, like bad stuff in his chest and lungs. It was like he was catching pneumonia but then his nose was running, it felt weird like a sickly poison kind of feeling like after he got the shot, he could not tell but it seemed like severe allergies or like hay fever kind of but it was different, it was a weird feeling. He had taken a bunch of herbal remedies Benadryl took herbal allergy stuff and it worked really fast and after like 3 days it was gone. He does not know what that was but it was pretty intense. No further information provided. It was reported that, caller got his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 29MAY2021 and had side effects. He wanted to know if he could get only a half dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He also wanted to know if there was any correlation to having COVID-19 and having more of a reaction. Caller wanted to know if there was a correlation between having COVID-19 and having more side effects to the vaccine. He stated that his Pharmacist said there might be a correlation to people having COVID before getting the vaccine and having more problematic side effects from the first vaccine instead of the second. Response was given as &#34;he should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. He was referred to speak to healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Healthcare provider would have known the health situation and could access to information that better help inform the decision. From the CONS document on efficacy. Two shots were generally needed to provide the best protection against COVID-19 and the shots were given several weeks apart. The first shot primes the immune system, helping it recognize the virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response. Side effects after the second shot might be more intense than the ones experienced after the first shot. The side effects are normal signs that body is building protection and should go away within a few days&#34;. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 antibody tested negative. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe allergies (drug hypersensitivity). He visited emergency room due to the event chest pain. On an unspecified date in 2021 the outcome of the events it was like he was catching pneumonia but then his nose was running, neck spasms, blood pressure, clarified as low blood pressure, tired, he got really sick, severe congestion, like bad stuff in his chest and lungs, it was like he was catching pneumonia but then his nose was running was unknown, on an unspecified date in 2021, severe allergies was recovered, rapid heart rate, really bad chest pains, cough was recovered on 30May2021, on an unspecified date in May2021 vomit, nausea was recovered, gasping for air, interrupted his sleep and stuff in his throat/weird stuff on his throat was unknown.

                                                Within the first few day - typical AEs (low grade fever, sore arm, fatigue).  However, the atypical AEs included daily and persistent dizziness, &#34;brain fog&#34;, fatigue, difficulty going up the stairs without getting winded (difficulty with physical exertion).  These symptoms are still present on March 31st (11 days post injection).  GI / diarrhea symptoms are also present.  Of note, I did have COVID in the past (January 2021) - and had similar symptoms that had resolved at the time of the vaccine.  These symptoms are severe enough that it may prevent the second shot (due to concerns of worsening AEs or prolonged events).  Of note, the fatigue was worse with the actual disease vs. the vaccine.

                                                Within 60 seconds of receiving the injection, I experienced moderate breathing difficulty.   After 10-20 minutes, I noticed that my throat felt slightly swollen (slight difficulty swallowing).  Due to a hyperallergic event that occurred about 12 years ago, I occasionally run into something that triggers the respiratory effect  - although usually the reaction is milder than that caused by the vaccine.  However, the throat swelling is new.  I took a single puff of an Albuterol inhaler around 5 minutes after the injection,  but it had no effect (usually the case for me when the cause is allergic in nature).  About 37 minutes after the injection, medical staff advised me to take an antihistamine.  I took approximately 6 mg of doxylamine succinate (orally).  However, by this point, the breathing had already started to ease slightly.  Approximately 30 minutes later, my breathing was back to normal and the throat inflamation was gone.  It&#39;s uncertain how much of that would have occurred through time alone and how much of it was the antihistamine starting to take effect.  My BP was very high when measured during treatment.  Partially explained by the albuterol inhaler combined with pseudoephedrine taken earlier in the day, along with anxiety and exertion from the event itself.

                                                Patient received his second Pfizer vaccine on Friday. Saturday he came down with symptoms that we considered were like the stereotypical second dose. Fever, cough, shortness of breath, coming and going. It lingered until Tuesday, at which time he got a Covid test- negative. Went to dr, and he said there was a possibility of blood clots. Tests showed that he had severe pulmonary embolisms in both lungs- the main and 3 secondary arteries.

I went to urgent care and they gave me a shot of prednisone and gave me a pack of the same steroid to take over the next 6 days they also prescribed some prescription Claritin and Famotidine.. The following day 4/16/21 around 1130pm I woke up to my face being swollen as well as my tongue. I was taken to the ER where the triage unit gave me epinephrine as well as another steroid to stabilize the swelling as I was having trouble breathing. Once stabilized I was released and took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6 hours as well as the Claritin, famotidine, and the prednisone. I had hives for a few days after and followed up with my primary doctor, but as of today I feel like i am back to normal.

                                                Symptoms consistent with myocarditis; EKG showed very subtle diffuse ST elevations; chest pain; dyspnea; Troponin trended to 19; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included chronic back pain, degenerative disc disease, and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis; the patient had no risk factors for cardiac disease other than obesity; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cyclobenzaprine and pregabalin (LYRICA) and experienced allergies. It was unknown if the patient had other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Apr2021, 8 hours after the 2nd Pfizer vaccine was received, the patient developed chest pain with dyspnea. It was also reported that on 08Apr2021, troponin trended to 19; electrocardiogram (EKG) showed very subtle diffuse ST elevations; and the symptoms were consistent with myocarditis. All the adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit; an emergency room/department or urgent care; and hospitalization on an unspecified date for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included other/Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-at assay: negative on 10Apr2021 (post vaccination). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included colchicine and ibuprofen. The patient was recovering from all the events.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Information provided was so limited to prevent a meaningful medical assessment. Other than a temporal association, there was no evidence or argument suggesting a causal relationship for BNT162B2 in the reported events, serious due to hospitalization. Otherwise, this patient did not show risk factors for cardiac disease, except for obesity. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                When I woke up the day after (Day #2) being given the vaccine I was extremely tired exhausted, I had intense chills and hot flashes. Never a fever. I felt nauseated. Completely lethargic. Muscle aches all over my body, was hard to move. I couldn&#39;t stay awake. My eyes hurt. I had intense migraines.  And no appetite. My right arm hurt, but not as bad as many others&#39; reported.  I took ibuprofen to help, it didn&#39;t. I drank lots of water and gatorade zero for the electrolytes. It didn&#39;t help either.  On day #3, this was when it got scary. The previous  symptoms carried over, minus the nausea and I was able to be mobile (less lethargic).  But something new started to happen. I took my dog out for a short walk, a slow pace, I am very athletic, and I had shortness of breath. I was winded from just walking slowly. Then the brain fog started to set in. This I hated the most. I wasn&#39;t able to comprehend things. I tried to assemble an item I bought from Amazon and it was extremely hard to follow simple instructions. I wasn&#39;t able to see clearly for some reason. And even comprehending emails that I was receiving was troublesome. I kept drinking water, and was able to eat a little. Had two more bottles of Gatorade Zero.  On day 3, most of all the symptoms subsided except that I still got winded from movement.  On day 4, I was fine.

No arm pain -- but nine days of brain pain, waking up feeling like my head was split, at least five days of altered vision, and most disturbed were my breathing and my heart. I felt for many days like I had a Brillo Pad in my lungs and heart, as well as lots of pressure in the chest and shortness of breath/labored breathing. Two days ago I thought I might be having a heart attack. The symptoms lightened yesterday morning (day nine) though I still have strange sensations in the head and taking a full, deep breath is not totally easy yet. .

The patient has been hospitalized with apparent cardiomyopathy for just over a week now (including a brief stay in CVICU) with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The onset date of shortness of breath and cardiomyopathy was 18Apr2021. All events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events which includes Lasix, milrinone, metoprolol, and carvedilol. On an unspecified date in Apr2021, the patient recovered from afebrile chills while outcome of the rest of the events was not yet recovered.

                                                experienced significant shortness of breath, heavy wheezing, and coughing on the weekend of 2/6/2021. Slight wheezing had been ongoing for months (difficulty breathing in January of 2020 when diagnosed with influenza A and intermittent slight wheezing continued throughout the year). Symptoms became worse throughout the weekend. I did continue my normal routine (taking trash to the dump, helped move a heavy tank out of a walkout basement, and moving  twelve 40 pound bags of wood pellets from store into truck then from truck into my home on day of hospitalization) Hospitalized on 2/7/2021

                                                Got First Pfizer Covid vaccine on 06JAN2021. About 4 days after that I started noticing allergy symptoms and mild intermittent wheezing. Then on about the 5th day after, my lower back pain increased, causing significant sciatic pain worse than ever before. On 22JAN21 I ended up going to urgent care for increased breathing problems, and also had to have pain management appointment within days as sciatic pain was debilitating and also significantly interfered with my sleep.  After steroid injection (In spine)on FEB 3rd for sciatica/back pain, and steroids/inhaler treatment for the breathing stuff, I would say I was pretty good to go . I didn&#39;t think too much of these unusual events for me both in timing and severity. On 12FEB2021, I got my second pfizer covid dose. I 14FEB I started noticing allergy symptoms again, and slight shortness of breath, used inhaler I had from before to help as breathing in seemed to not give me full breaths. Then, on 15FEB2021, in the evening out of nowhere while walking, my lower back/sciatica pain came back in full force, as if my leg were a lighting rod like before. So it almost seems as if the covid vaccine triggered an inflammatory reaction in my body. I am not certain, but because the series of events seem the same and in timing after my first covid vaccine, I figured I would at least report it.

                                                At about 6 pm I started having stomach cramps and diarrhea. The cramps worsened and by midnight the pain was at a nine. I was vomiting with intense force but nothing was coming up. My abdomen was bloated to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand upright and breathing was very painful. I was in that condition for about 12 hours before the swelling began to lessen. Now, 2 days later, I am still unable to eat and drink as normal and have moderate gastrointestinal discomfort with bloating.

                                                Woke up next morning at 7am with itching hands, slight swelling in lips and ears, nausea and diarrhea. Itching and swelling subsided with a dose of Loratadine. Nausea worsened that night and vomiting ensued with diarrhea worsening. At bedtime, itching returned, sleeplessness, vomiting and sweating profusely from the scalp and face, slight difficulty filling lungs with air. Another dose of Loratadine calmed symptoms. Wednesday (10th) through the next Thursday (18th ), nausea persisted, but eased with Benadryl and Emerton. Diarrhea persisted through Monday (15th). No fever, no soreness, no headache.

I ate dinner and got ready for bed.  But then, starting 12 hours after my shot, starting at 11:00 pm, I began to have severe chills and total body shakes.  I was curled up into a ball under blanket, both freezing cold and profusely sweating.  My breathing was very fast and I couldn&#39;t slow it down.  My stomach was very upset and I was unable to eat anything.  At 3:30 am, I got a severe Migraine which lasted until 6:00 am.  I continued to feel very ill the whole rest of the day.  Finally, around 9:00 am some 34 hours after syptoms began, they left me.

I went to the doctor and then the ER at a local hospital on April 28.  They found fluid and possible inflammation around the hearth along with very high blood pressure.  Since then I have had medication for inflammation and high BP.  They are still doing tests to figure out what is wrong with me.

He reported that there was a little tenderness at the injection site, but it was no big deal. Then at 18:00 he noticed some stomach discomfort and had one episode of diarrhea. Then at midnight he woke up with extreme pain in his stomach with swelling and bloating. He couldn&#39;t stand up with the pain, it was at his limit. He added that his roommate wanted him to go to the emergency room, but he didn&#39;t want to go to a rinky dink hospital in the middle of the night, so he stayed home. Stated that he started to have dry heaves and brought up some fluid then it was just violent dry heaves then finally he was able to bring up air. It was painful to breath because his abdomen was so swollen, and he felt like he was exhaling forcefully. The pain was high up under his rib cage. This all continued until around noon on Sunday when air finally came up. He laid on his stomach on a heating pad and by afternoon he was better; by Sunday evening the swelling had mostly subsided. Patient stated that when he had the swelling and bloating it felt hard up under his rib cage. It pushed his ribcage out of position and caused his sciatica to hurt and aggravated his lower back pain.

And then at the time of this report, stated that he could do his usual stretches.

                                                I &#39;had Covid&#39; beginning Saturday before Thanksgiving.  During that period, I had two tests, both from facility, and both tests came back negative. Symptoms included fever 102-103 for 12 days. No appetite (didn&#39;t eat for that duration). Headache. Excessive sweating. Extreme shallow breath. Hyperventilation. Body ache. No loss of smell or taste. No nausea. No mucus response.  Since that time, I have experienced extreme fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, headache.  After the first shot, those three symptoms increased.  With the second shot, I had fever 99.5-101 from Tuesday though Saturday. Nausea, headache, body ache, weakness, shortness of breath. It felt 85% similar in symptom and intensity as when I &#39;had Covid&#39;.   The greatest difference is the nausea. When I &#39;had Covid&#39; there was no nausea and I did not throw up. This time, I had persistent nausea and threw up multiple times in the first three days.

In the mirror I see the arches around the uvula swollen and red 11:50 Inform the nurse. Body starts shivering, talking and breathing is labored- according to my wife my voice sounded very different.  Nurse checks lungs through stethoscope and SPO2&#43; heart rate- All normal, does not detect any constriction of lung air passages. But I am panting while talking. 11:55 I decide to wait and monitor. Shivering slowly stops, breathing slowly starts to return to normal (in about 20 mins). The urge to pass stool stopped. 12:22 No change either way- Breathing is ok, but mild tingling around lips, and feeling of tightness at back of throat. I take 5mg Cetrizine HCl.  [Note: My mouth and throat felt like I have felt in the past with a reaction to shellfish.] 1:15 Redness at back of throat is less, and I feel normal. I drive off the parking lot of the vaccination site Next day Throat feels sore, but otherwise ok

                                                Heart Attack. A feeling of burning in my arms and mouth of the stomach, in addition to fatigue when walking, started on June 12, 2021. I never had such pain before and thought it&#39;s just a stomach virus or so. As the pain continues, I called my primary-care Dr. early morning of June 17 and scheduled appointment for a week later. But around 9:30 pm that day, June 17, the pain became so severe, in addition to nausea and shortness of breath. I went to emergency room and have been told that there is acute heart attack in progress and was moved to the Critical Care Unit in the Heart and Vascular Center. A blockage has been removed and a stent was installed in morning of June 18, through heart catheterization procedure. As there was damage to the heart muscle due to the heart attack, I am supposed to go back later, in 4-6 weeks, to remove couple more blockages and install stents.

About 7 days after the vaccine, it started to worsen.  I felt pain, chest pressure, back shoulder pain,  jaw pain,  and shortness of breath.   I called the main local  hospital number and was instructed to go to the ER.  I did go to the ER and they did blood work, EKG which confirmed that I was having a heart attack.  I was stabilized and was then transferred my via ambulance to A Medical Center which is bigger hospital and better equipped.  I was admitted and the next day, I had surgery for a heart catheter. They also placed 2 stents in my heart.   I was in the hospital for 4 days and was discharged with a prescription for Furosemide 40mg, rest, cardiac rehab, and to follow up with cardiologist.  Prior to the heart attack, I only had hypertension.

So much that I was worried my muscles would begin to sieze up and cramp.  I had warm clothes and 5 blankets and could not get warm for over 2 hours.  Elevated heart rate and breathing.  Nothing warmed me.  Eventually (and with ibuprofen) the incident subsided.  I felt weak and just &#34;off&#34; with slight body aces and fatigue for the next day and a half.

After 5 min, patient reported feeling light-headed and tried to stand up. The patient sat down on the floor and leaned against the wall. Patient was able to stand and walk to the provider room for closer observation. Patient felt hot and looked pale. The provider placed a blood pressure cuff on the patient, at which point the patient slumped forward and stopped breathing. A carotid pulse was not able to be appreciated. The patient was pulled to the floor, positioned airway open and was given oxygen. BP was 96/40. Blood sugar was checked (104) and the AED pads were placed. EMS was called. AED advised no shock, patient had a pulse and was breathing. Patient gradually became alert, though reported not feeling well. Patient was disoriented and was not aware of passing out nor the current event. Repeat BP 115/50. Patient began vomiting (~300-400 mL). Patient left with EMS to be evaluated at local Emergency Department.   Of note, patient reports history of vasovagal syncope events 2/2 to various situations.

                                                Please note that I am the patient in question here, but also an physician, so I will write this in technical terms as best as I understand what happened.  For background, my cardiac history is important. I had a work-up for palpitations performed more than a year ago that revealed normal cardiac function (EF &gt; 65% by NM myocardial perfusion study), normal coronary arteries, and significant exercise tolerance (I maxed out the treadmill test).  Usuallly I have to engage in vigorous exercise to raise my heart rate &gt; 160 bpm. My resting heart rate is typically in the 50s or less.   On Jan 15, 2021 I had an elective cerebral angiography and embolization procedure performed. I was asymptomatic prior to this procedure.  The procedure requires general anesthesia for several hours.  I have had the procedure conducted a few months previously and it typically has an unremarkable recovery, one night required in the hospital.   After the procedure and following extubation, I had hypoxia on room air, tachycardia, wheezing and fatigue.  The working cause for this was suspected atelectasis due to general anesthesia and I was given bronchodilators.  While my breathing improved overnight, I was very tachycardic even while sleeping ? pulse greater than 130.  Overnight telemetry noted arrhythmias with sinus tachycardia.   The tachycardia persisted long after prior albuterol use so I had CTA chest on 1/16.  No PTE was noted, though some basilar atelectasis and mild upper lobe ground glass opacities.  I was discharged but due to continued mild hypoxia overnight, low grade fever (&lt; 101F), and persistent tachycardia with any movement, I went to the ED on 1/17 for additional evaluation.   In the ED, I had tachycardia with arrhythmias noted (rate up to 160). Sinoatrial exit block noted on EKG and telemetry.  COVID-19 testing was negative by nasopharyngeal PCR and antigen testing.  Resting heart rate was &gt; 90 even when sleeping.   Follow-up echocardiogram on 1/21/21 revealed depressed ejection fraction (40-45%).  Cardia MRI on 2/1 was performed to evaluate for cardiomyopathy.  Symptoms at this point were fatigue, dyspnea with even mild activity (e.g. walking), and tachycardia  &gt; 140 bpm with even just walking.  My resting heart rate improved to 40s-50s.  It showed normal wall motion and ventricle size with slightly reduced ejection fraction. Cardiology recommended cardiac event monitoring which I wore for 28 days. It only revealed sinus tachycardia and bradycardia.   I still don?t feel great but able to do more physically than a couple of months ago.  I await further f/u cardiac imaging to see if there has been improvement in the heart function.

                                                I felt fine after the shot, but two hours later, my throat felt like it was closing and it hurt in a way I&#39;ve never felt before. I had a bad migraine and my whole body was sore. My blood pressure was high for me at 143/94 with a heart rate of 94. I trend at 120/80 with  a heart rate around 90. I take my blood pressure regularly to help manage Type II Diabetes.   I was concerned with my throat, as the other symptoms seemed normal for the vaccine. It was very uncomfortable. I phoned the nurse line and was told to have someone bring me to the ER to check me out and take a Benadryl. I took the Benadryl and packed for the ER with meds and ID and my friend drove me. I was still uncomfortable enough to warrant wanting to go and had become very dizzy.   When we got to the ER there was a wait and I went to my friend&#39;s car until called. After about 30 minutes (about 45 minutes after the Benadryl) my throat released and felt much better. My vitals were taken and seemed normal. The normal aches of the vaccine didn&#39;t concern me enough to stay, so I returned home.   My symptoms remain what seem to be normal reactions to the vaccine: sore joints, slight headache, slightly sore throat, Charlie horse feeling at the injection site. Nothing of major concern. My largest worry was with the throat feeling closed, but it appears the Benadryl took care of it.

                                                On May 9th I began to experience severe pain in my back extending down my left side. The pain was severe enough to prevent sleeping that night. The pain continued throughout May 10th becoming worse with deep breaths or any type of internal strain (cough, sneeze, etc). That evening, I took two Tylenol and later two Ibuprofen and was able to sleep. The pain persisted for the next week, slowly improving but not fully going away. On May 15th I conducted a telemedicine appointment and was advised to go to either Urgent Care or the ER. I chose the ER at  Hospital. A D-Dimer test showed elevated results and a CT scan was ordered. The CT revealed blood clots in my right lung, specifically &#34;Subpleural conslidation in the posterior basilar segment the right lower lobe is present, compatible with pulmonary infarct. Question additional pulmonary infarct in the lateral basilar segment the lower right lobe.

                                                This is a Healthcare employee working at a facility, divested this center and it is under new management.   Previously on 12/1/2020 PT was diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, remained asymptomatic and returned to work on 12/11/2020.   On 12/28 administered the vaccine at a workplace clinic . 4 days post-immunization on 12/31/2020 PT reported feeling &#34;unwell&#39; to his direct supervisor and was sent home. On 1/4/2021 PT reported to his supervisor that he had gone to the hospital due to having a fever and shortness of breath, he was tested for COVID at that time and was negative. PT returned home.   On 1/13/2021 the center received a call from PT mother reporting that her son had returned to the hospital on the evening of 1/12/2021. Per his mother, PT was attempting to drink from a straw, but was unable to and had noted a facial droop. When he arrived at the hospital he was diagnosed with &#34;suspected Bell&#39;s Palsy&#34;. Due to the immunization being administered on 12/28/2020 and suspected diagnosis of Bell&#39;s Palsy on 1/13/2021 it is unclear if the two events are related.

                                                I was playing ice hockey on April 10, 2021 when I started to experience shortness of breath.  Coming to the bench between shifts is part of the game and that time on the bench is used to recover (both for your muscles and for your cardiovascular system).  However, towards the latter part of the game, I continued to be short of breath even while sitting on the bench.  Then in the last 10 minutes or so of the game, I fell to the ice for no reason.  It was as if my muscles had just totally failed.  I thought the shortness of breath may have been a sign of a Covid infection since I had not reached the 14 day period after my second shot.  So I went to urgent care to get a Covid test.  My test came back negative, but the doctor was concerned with my symptoms, so he took an x-ray of my heart and an ECG.  He said that he noticed a blur around my heart, but didn&#39;t have any explanation.  He thought I was in very good health, so he gave me a list of heart specialists to contact if I had another &#39;episode&#39;.  Fortunately, I did not have another episode.  The only reason that I am submitting this incident is because I understand the administration is having an emergency meeting to review cases of an inflamed heart.  I am not sure my situation was an inflamed, but I wanted to have my episode documented in case my situation was a temporary adverse reaction to the vaccine.

It was reported that the patient had taken nebulizer treatments at home with no relief.  Symptoms began around 5:30pm.  Patient ambulated into ER at time of visit but during the visit became unresponsive.  Patient was intubated and coded with time of death called at 9:52pm.  Patient has history of asthma.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I had the occasional sore arm and pain at the vaccination site. The second day after I started to feel my chest started to burn, which was accompanied by trouble breathing. It was a pain that I have never experienced before in my chest it felt tight and was burning very bad. I started to feel light headed as if I was going to faint while doing my normal daily activities. I decided to stop doing anything that caused my heart to beat too fast. So later on that  night i decided to go to the ER, where they did an ekg and some blood work. They also did a scan of my chest where the doctor said everything came back and looked normal. Over time the pain and everything I was experiencing started to get better. I still have a hard time breathing every now and then. Also after the vaccine I experienced a slight cough and runny nose.

                                                3/25: Approx 5 mins after injection, started breathing quickly and became lightheaded. Moments later, heart rate elevated north of 190 bpm and blood pressure went up to approx 180/100. Developed dry mouth (was very thirsty) and shaking/chills. Took about 60 minutes to stabilize. Went to ER for evaluation and tests around 2:30P. Received a liter of fluid. Both EKG and Bloodwork was indicated as normal. Released from hospital around 6P. Slept through most of the night.   3/26: heart rate was erratic all day. Would race and then stabilize throughout the day/night. Extremely lethargic. No trouble breathing (was able to breathe and take deep breathes) but took effort to breathe.  3/27: 1:40A woke up heart began racing at close to 200 bpm. Dry mouth, shakes. Similar to what I experienced immediately following the vaccine shot. Went to ER out of precaution. Symptoms stabilized after about an hour. Hospital did EKG, blood work and chest X-ray. all were normal, lungs were clear. However, glucose and bilirubin were both slightly elevated.  3/29: Still feeling lethargic. Heart rate has stabilized some but is still erratic. It  easily increases from simply walking around the house (much more than usual).   3/30: Scheduled appointment with primary care physician 3/31: Scheduled appointment with cardialogist

                                                The evening of the shot my body basically turned on itself and began an all out mission to rid the vaccine.  Of course, that couldn&#39;t happen, but my body was going to proceed until I was dead or recovering.  I began having severe chills, roasting heat flashes, headache, and body ache.  Every sweat gland turned on full blast and did not turn off.  I began to vomit in outrageous fashion.  As violent as I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I had &#34;sessions&#34; of vomiting at least thirty times from Thurs night to Monday afternoon.  When I could get out of the bathroom, I would collapse back into my sweat soaked bed.  I would have an awful time trying to catch my breath.  It would be up to ten minutes of hyperventilating and racing pulse, until it would suddenly normalize.  And then I&#39;d be utterly exhausted and slip into some kind of semi-sleep coma.  This would not last even an hour before I&#39;d be racing to the bathroom again.  This was the first sixty hours.  Vomit. Hyperventilate. Wish for death.  Sleep coma. Repeat.  About 24 hrs in I added severe diarrhea that was a part of every bathroom journey from then on.  Ate nothing.  Couldn&#39;t take normal meds.  Sipped some pedialite.  Late Sunday I turned a corner and felt like I wouldn&#39;t die.  Took a full seven days for me to get any energy back and feel human again.- Every single symptom besides headache, was the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced.

                                                Experience two large heart palpitations and what seemed stopped beating for a second, this was followed by tremendous pressure in my head, I thought I was experiencing a stroke.  I felt like I was going to black out and was having tightness in my chest , my wife took me to the E.R.  I had an EKG done and it not show any arrhythmia and CT scan of my head did not show any abnormality.  They scheduled me to follow up with cardiologist.  The whole week I experienced the following symptoms: Tightness and sharp pains in chest; Difficulty breathing, especially at night (had to sleep sitting up on couch one night and another night woke up with difficulty breathing , appeared to be the biggest problem when laying flat).  Would get out of breath walking up stairs; Moments I would get really light headed with a feeling like I could pass out; Symptoms last until the 4/16 , when they finally went away.  Follow up with Cardiologist, who scheduled an electrocardiogram and stress tests on 5/7.  The tests results showed that I had a healthy heart and no underlying conditions. I&#39;m 49 and never have experienced any cardiac events. before or have a family history of cardiac disease. I have no known allergies either.

He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

He had his first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/23, and his symptoms began on 4/29. He was itchy all over, but when he developed fever and SOB he came to the ER on 5/2 and was discharged on prednisone. His symptoms continued and so he came back to the ER and was admitted. He had a lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma (pathology returned negative for lymphoma). He was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. He tested &#43; for EBV IGG but not IGM. EBV PCR was pending upon discharge. He had a borderline positive lyme serology. He was discharged on doxycycline and steroids with improved symptoms. He returned to the ER with again worsening SOB, night sweats, worsening rash, recurrence of fever. He denies sore throat or any sick contacts. He reports a normal appetite. He was found to be hypotensive and in AKI.

Symptoms worsened and he was admitted to ICU on May 21st via the ED for multiorgan failure including respiratory failure with R pneumonia, Shock, Renal failure, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock liver failure requiring invasive vent support and treatment for septic shock including vasopressor support and antibiotic therapy.  He was started on CRRT on the 22nd.  His INR continues to rise and Hb dropping consistent with worsening DIC.  Blood cultures are positive for MRSA.  He will likely die from progressive septic shock and MSOF.

A 49-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, #lot: Er2613) via an unspecified route of administration administered in Arm Right on 24Mar2021 and second dose (#lot: Er8629) via an unspecified route of administration administered in Arm Right on 14Apr2021 as single dose (at the age of 49-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced nausea, fever, fatigue, chest pain and difficulty breathing on an unspecified date. The patient did not report this because he didn&#39;t think it was relevant until recent media about myocarditis. He was close 3x to dialing 911 thought was having heart attack. The outcome of all the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

On arrival, patient appeared critically ill with cool, clammy skin, diaphoretic, complaining of chest pain.  Patient initially able to answer simple questions, however quickly became unconscious, witnessed having tonic colonic seizure activity.  Patient given 2 mg of lorazepam which aborted the seizure, however he remained unresponsive.  IV fluids were started, and patient remained hypotensive after 3 L of fluids.  Bedside cardiac ultrasound was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.  We continued fluid resuscitation and patient was intubated, while stat Cardiology consult was called.  Patient suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after intubation. Cardiology performed emergent pericardiocentesis at the bedside which showed hemopericardium with output of greater than 500 mL of blood.  ROSC was achieved following pericardiocentesis, and we continued resuscitative measures.  Emergent arterial line and central venous lines were placed.  Patient began to have profuse bleeding from all orifices, and massive transfusion protocol was initiated.  Patient was stabilized enough to be taken to CT scanner which showed an extensive aortic dissection extending into the RCA, abdominal aorta, brachiocephalic artery, common carotids, and into the abdominopelvic vasculature.  Cardiac and vascular surgery were consulted stat, and the decision was made to take the patient emergently to the OR.  We were informed shortly after that the patient had expired en route to the operating room and they were unable to obtain ROSC. Final impression: type A aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade. Second dose of mRNA vaccine (unknown if Pfizer or Moderna) received two days prior to event.

This consumer (patient) reported for himself that a 49-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 49-years, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 23Apr2021 at 02:11 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included he and his family did have the COVID-19 virus in Nov2020 (with the COVID-19 virus in Nov2020 his fever had reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit). Concomitant medications were not reported. He was calling about the vaccine. He was scheduled for his second dose on 14May2021 but between his first and second dose, he developed pneumonia. He reported he and his family did have the COVID-19 virus in Nov2020. He was the only one that got sick after receiving the vaccine. He didn&#39;t know if it was coincidental or happenstance. He had been taking medication and hadn&#39;t been well enough to get his second dose. His primary care doctor and the doctor he saw at the urgent care both told him not to get the second dose until he was well. Now several weeks had passed and he wanted to know if he was ok to get the second one or will he have to restart and get the first vaccine again. The type of pneumonia that he had was called Valley Fever. He had been told it was because of the dry climate. He did have a chest x-ray and that was who the doctor knew he had pneumonia. He also had a blood test to confirm that he had the Valley Fever. He also had a COVID-19 virus test and that was negative. He actually thought he had the COVID-19 virus for a second time. The symptoms were exactly like the COVID-19 virus. He had a low grade fever, body chills, body aches, a cough developed and a really intense headache. He went to the urgent care with those symptoms and tested him and found out he did have the Valley Fever, a type of pneumonia. The doctor ordered the blood test to confirm the Valley Fever. His fever didn&#39;t get as high this time like it did when he had the COVID-19 virus. This time with the Valley Fever his fever was about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He definitely had body aches, chills, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Since Nov2020 when he had COVID-19 he can say his lung capacity wasn&#39;t what it used to be pre COVID-19 virus. He was just able to go out and walk his dog and felt like he was breathing normally. Then he received the first dose and a week and a half later he got sick with the Valley Fever. He would like to get the second COVID-19 vaccine but wanted to know if he had to start the process over. He didn&#39;t take any medications and considers himself healthy. He would like to add that when he went for his follow up for the Valley Fever he had a complete blood work and urinalysis and interestingly enough his numbers came back that now he was in the diabetic range. He didn&#39;t know if it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine or not but thought that he should add it. He wasn&#39;t prescribed any medications for the diabetes he was told to change his diet. His blood sugar came back normally and his doctor told him when people have diabetes their blood sugar gets out of whack. He was going to change his diet for the next couple months. He went to the urgent care on 14May2021 with his symptoms, that was the same day he was supposed to get the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was asking if he was outside the window and need to start over or just need to get another shot. He said that he wants to get the vaccine. The events shortness of breath, difficulty breathing result in physician office. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Date these symptoms started was 1/27/2021:  About 12 hours after injection, developed fatigue and slight nausea as expected.  Oral temperature 98.0.  Commuted to work without issue. ~ 1400: As day progressed, nausea subsided, but fatigue grew more profound and developed pain in the right subscapular area with exertional shortness of breath walking any length of time. (Injection of initial and second doses were both in right deltoid). 1540 - 1800: Fatigue increased, developed a burning/tearing pain with every yawn and deep breath from the top of my trachea into both left and right mainstem bronchi and radiated to right arm.  It literally felt like someone was trying to tear out my bronchial tree with each breath. 1800: Arrived home and medicated self-medicated with Motrin 400mg. 1800 -2030: rested at home with still some breathing pain, no shortness of breath, but incredibly tired. 2045: Went to bed and slept for the next 12.5 hours without any issued during the night. 0800: Woke up nearly all symptoms were gone, only some minor residual fatigue.  No breathing pain, no nausea, no subscapular pain. I did not seek medical attention for symptoms, nor did I contact my provider. I experienced fatigue and a headache with the first dose, but no other symptoms.  I never experienced fever or chills

I also noticed that I started feeling really sluggish with some muscle pains.   Approximately 11:30 PM, I attempted to go to sleep and noticed that I started having a minor respiratory distress where I could hear myself wheezing.  The wheezing only lasted about one hour.   All the symptoms disappeared after 36 hours without any treatments or medications.  At this point, I&#39;m not sure If I should get my second vaccine shot.

I received my first dose of phizer on 1/22/21 and a second dose 21 days later but was given Moderna not phizer.  I continue to have headaches on and off all day, they are short but intense lasting about 5-10 minutes, sometimes hour or two between.  Also shortness of breath and increased heart rate with just slight activity.  Going up a flight of stairs my heart rate will quickly increase to 130-140  BPM which has never happened before.  I have a fitness tracker on my watch so I watch it closely every day and it was never that high.  My heart rate will recover fairly quick if I sit and it will come down to 80-90 BPM, at night when relaxed for a while the lowest I see it is about 70-75 BPM, sleeping it will be around 65 bpm.

Went to hospital on 16th of February and was admitted due to heart condition and recent heart attack. I told them my next vaccine was due on the 18th and they gave it to me while I was admitted.  Within 24 hours I had another heart attack. I was sent to another hospital for an Angiogram where they expected to find blockage and prepared to install a stint. They found no blockage. There is no medical explination.

I looked in mirror and saw two pimple size type spots itchy. over the neck 30 mins another itchy pimple grew and neck got a bit red  and under an ear got red and itchy.   over the next hour my breathing felt a little more difficult, though oxygen level oximeter reading still good.  8.5 hours after vaccination both sides of my upper back/shoulders were covered in hives.  I felt a bit foggy also.  I administered epinephrine pen to my thigh.  Over next few minutes the hives disappeared (except for a few pimple size spots though they basically disappeared)and the itch was gone.   My breathing felt fine.  I monitored signs and symptoms with no noticeable issues for the next day&#43;.  This was the 1st time I ever used an epi pen.

Symptoms tapered off over 3-5 days. Similar experience with 2nd vaccine but less pronounced with a shorter timeframe, tapering off after 2-3 days. Strongest side effects after first vaccine, symptoms did not become noticeable until a couple of hours after it was administered, increasing next 24 hours before lessening over time. Basically identical to long covid symptoms but lasting only for a few days after vaccinations and not before.

                                                Upon return from the vaccination I experienced no ill effects until that night. The symptoms were then similar to when I had Covid in December of 2020.  Chills, headache and body aches. This lasted overnight and the next day  I only felt the aches and fatigue, which have lingered, slowly improving for the past several days. Three days after the shot, I experienced some respiratory issues, shortness of breath during certain activities and occasional coughing. This lasted about two days. Now, six days after the vaccination, the remaining symptoms are minor aches and fatigue, these seem to be waning.

                                                Presented to ED today with complaint of right-sided CP onset yesterday. Patient has history of renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver.  He has had recurrent pleural effusions involving the right lung.  Has worsened pain with breathing. Had a R tube placed due to pleural effusion and last week when the tape was taken off it pulled and caused pain. Endorses SOB. No significant cardiac history. No h/o DVT, PE. Has renal CA and had L kidney removed. Patient admitted. Pulmonary/critical care was consulted regarding Pleurx catheter.  It is felt that his pleural effusion had decreased in size, and the catheter was likely contributing to his right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Catheter is removed with good results of his pain.  Patient however did have recurrent fevers.  Empirically placed on Rocephin.  With this, he did improve. He was discharged in stable condition.

                                                ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER THE 2ND PFIZER COVID VACCINE I DEVELOPED DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AFTER WALKING FOR N &#43; MILE (I WALK DAILY APPROX 3 MILES.. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS). IT WAS STRANGE -TAKING DEEP BREATHS DID NOT HELP. INITIALLY I THOUGHT I MAY HAVE THROMBOTIC COMPLICATION, OR A CARDIOMYOPATHY RELATED TO SOME VIRUS. SINCE I WAS ABLE TO WALK DAILY 1-3 MILES I DID NOT SEEK MEDICAL HELP, ALSO, THESE SYMPTOMS OF DAILY DYSPNEA ON EXERTION (N &#43; MILE) LASTED N 2 WKS - AND COMPLETELY RESOLVED IN ADDITIONAL 2 WKS. NOW I THINK THAT THESE SYMPTOMS MIGHT HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE COVID VACCINE (AND WANT TO INFORM POTENTIAL GUIDANCE FOR THE USE OF MRNA FOR REVACCI- NATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SIMILAR COMPLICATIONS.  ALSO, I FILED A PREVIOUS REPORT - I DEVELPOED MULTIPLE JOINT EFFUSIONS AFTER THE 1ST AND 2ND  DOSE COVID VACCINE - IT TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT BY NOW THESE SYMPTOMS ARE RESOLVED.

A 50-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: 6205), via an unknown route of administration in the left arm on 16Mar2021 at 15:30 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history of the patient included allergies. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included ZYRTEC.

A 50-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8737; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), via intramuscular route of administration, administered in left arm on 31Mar2021, as dose 2, single (age at vaccination: 50 years), for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus which was diagnosed about 3-4 years ago and sleep apnoea which was diagnosed about 10 years ago and the patient sees a lung doctor for this yearly and uses CPAP machine (both are unknown whether ongoing or not) and the patient has never smoked or done drugs. The patient did not administer any vaccinations within four weeks prior or on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was no family medical history relevant to adverse events. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6206, expiration date 30Jun2021) on 10Mar2021, administered on right arm muscle as dose 1 single, (age at vaccination: 50 years), for covid-19 immunization and had no adverse effect. Patient&#39;s wife said that nothing like this has happened in the past. The patient was sitting at the kitchen table at about 5:30 pm and it was about an hour since they ate. The patient all of the sudden didn&#39;t feel right, couldn&#39;t breathe, was having chest pains, and was white as a ghost, started sweating profusely. The reporter and the patient got in the car and went to the hospital and they did a cardiac work up on him, they gave him nitro paste on his chest and was hospitalized or admitted because of the events. All the symptoms started at the same time. On 26Jun2021, they did an electrocardiogram/EKG which was fine (normal) but the patient&#39;s troponin was elevated. They transferred the patient to another hospital. The patient had a stress test on 27Jun2021, which was normal (They took pictures of the patient&#39;s heart during the stress test). Reportedly, the patient&#39;s blood pressure had never been high but it was high when he got to the hospital. The patient is not back to normal but was not complaining of anything. They put the patient on a heparin drip at the hospital for the troponin levels. The doctors are leaning more toward myocardiopathy and think it was related to the vaccine. The hospitalization duration was of 2 days, i.e., from 26Jun2021 to 27Jun2021. The patient was going to see a cardiologist on Tuesday. The outcome of the events: The doctors are leaning more toward myocardiopathy, blood pressure has never been high but it was high when he got to the hospital and troponin was elevated reported as unknown and the outcome was assessed as resolving for rest of the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Immediately after receiving the injection, I felt pain/sore that traveled from the injection site, went through and across my left pectoral and ended at center of my chest/heart area.  I waited 15 minutes in the observation area to see if symptoms would get worse, but they did not; and so I left the facility and drove home.  On my way home, about 45 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt my throat tightening up a bit, and my left hand and eyelids began to cramp up.  I stopped at a pharmacy and bought some Benadryl.  After 30 minutes, the pain in my chest began to feel better, and the cramping had disappeared.  At about 6 pm that same day, my chest pain returned; and so I took one more Benadryl.  The pain/soreness began to disappear after about 30 minutes.  I felt fine for exactly two weeks.  On Thursday, April 1st, I woke up with severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constant vomiting for about 12 hours.  Went to urgent care and received an anti-nausea shot.  The vomiting stopped, but the abdominal pain continued until the next morning.  The weekend of April 10th, I experienced the chest pain again.  This time it was very concerning because I felt very lightheaded, short of breath and faint.  I checked myself into ER two days after.

                                                11 minutes after vaccine administration I began experiencing prickling sensation of mouth lips followed by prickling sensation of my tongue, increased heart rate and for a few seconds felt my throat tightening.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes.  By the time I was evaluated at the emergency department a few minutes later I was feeling much better.  I did not need to take any medications.  7 hours later I began experiencing itching all over my body however, I never developed a rash.  My heart rate slightly increased.  Simply did not feel well.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes and again resolved without having to take any medications.

                                                Dose 1 -Muscle twitched on injection into R deltoid.  Immediately after injection experienced warm and cold sensations through right arm,  intermittent pains along arm.   Was asked to be observed 30 mins  post injection.  Sent home.   Paresthesias (intermittent warm, cold, tingling sensations) continued with radiation into right axillary, and into neck.  Experienced  intermittent  facial tingling.  On day 3 post injection, started with burning eye discomfort in right eye.   Went to eye doctor to rule out eye infection.   No eye infection,  Instructed to use Refresh drops.   In 4 days subsided.   Day 7 experienced ear flushing and warmth that last 3 days and subsided.    Saw a neurologist to rule out nerve damage.   EMG was normal.   ANA titer was 1:40 with speckled and cytoplasma pattern.   My last ANA was negative when tested for inflammation due to back pain few years prior.     Neurologist  did not think this was an allergic reaction and since symptoms were gradually improving recommended second dose.   Symptoms fully resolved after 2 weeks  Dose 2 - Jan 19 , 2021 (21 days post) -  Decided to inject left deltoid to avoid trauma to right arm.     Was observed 30 mins and released.   No symptoms.     Moderate arm soreness x 4 days.   Day 3 post injection developed burning eye discomfort, intermittent tingling sensation in arm, warm/cold sensations.   Pain radiating to shoulder and neck.   Day 6  started very mild tingling and warm sensations in in cheek and chin area.  Also experienced intermittent prickly sensations in throat and sensation of throat tightness  predominantly on left side. (but no actual swelling).    Today (Jan 26, 2021) is Day 7 and these intermittent sensations are persisting.   Arm soreness has resolved.   Right eye burning discomfort improving.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

His blood pressure is a little high at 170 6/83 mm, pulse 76 per minute saturating 96% on room air, troponin less than 6, BNP 16, WBC 12.3,, EKG without any significant ST T-wave changes. CT angiogram of the chest shows nonocclusive thrombi in almost all the lobes, there is no saddle embolus noted.  There is no evidence of right heart strain.  Echo: The technical quality of the exam was limited due to suboptimal acoustic windows. The left ventricle is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded due to limited visualization. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. No significant valvular pathology identified with Doppler examination. There was insufficient tricuspid regurgitation envelope detected to calculate right ventricular systolic pressure.  Injection of contrast documented no interatrial shunt. There is no comparison study available.  He was started on Heparin gtt. And admitted for observation. He required no supplemental oxygen. He was discharged later pm on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for 3 months. I am questioning did he had COVID-19 vaccine related bilateral PE. His hypercoagulable profile is pending. He has no sign of malignancy, no new symptoms, no weight loss. He had normal colonoscopy 2 yrs ago.  He should follow up with his PCP.  He was given work excuse from 4/26-5/3/21. She shouldn&#39;t take non steroidal anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen (Motrin), Naproxen, Naprosyn, Voltaren, Relafen ... meds because of blood thinner Eliquis.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

Patient is a 51-year-old male with a PMHx significant for hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis and morbid obesity who initially presented to the ED for evaluation of chest pain, cough and shortness of breath.   On presentation, vitals were mostly unremarkable other than some mild tachycardia and tachypnea.  Patient was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on room air but was placed on supplemental oxygen for comfort.  Blood work was mostly unremarkable.  ABG was not particularly concerning.  Troponin was negative x3.  Patient underwent chest CTA which showed basilar atelectasis bilaterally and scattered groundglass opacities and scattered borderline size hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with patient&#39;s known sarcoidosis.   Patient was treated with supportive care and monitored overnight.  He was able to maintain sufficient oxygen levels.  On the time my evaluation, patient continues to complain of bilateral rib pain worse with deep breaths consistent with costochondritis.  I discussed with the patient that he will need to continue to take NSAIDs on a scheduled basis to help with his discomfort.  Additionally I offered to prescribe cough medicine. I discussed possibly discharging the patient on steroids however he states that he makes a point to avoid taking steroids due to his history of hemochromatosis.  At this point, patient no longer requires care in the hospital and can be discharged home.  Patient is agreeable with the plan and all questions have been answered appropriately.

                                                Having adult onset severe asthma I am prone to lung inflammation from a number of sources including some foods and allergens as well as viruses and smoke of any kind. I had been doing fine that week until the day after the second shot. I had severe shortness of breath, bad enough to keep me home and using my rescue inhaler several times that next day. This also occured when I had Covid in November 2020. It took me longer to test negative, 3 weeks. I believe that the shot caused an immune reaction, like it should, but also triggered an asthma attack that lasted several days but progressively reduced as time went on. Last week I had dizziness and heart palpitations. I have no idea if it was the shot still or the meds for my asthma, but I thought I should include it.

Excerpt from ED notes od MD follows: &#34;Initial ED interventions: iv fluids, low dose iv ativan, iv toradol, iv zofran.  ED course: patient arrives very anxious, writhing on bed, difficult to redirect. With chronic tonicity, not seizing. Mother arrives, and he recognizes her, seems to be consoled somewhat by her presence, but she is unable to direct him, and describes his behavior as irregular, and events acute this evening at her home.  Patient rests, and then HR decrease to 50s on monitior and patient found to be pulseless - I immediately start chest compressions, and achieve ROSC after PEA arrest with administration of EPI/compressions. Patient intubated per procedure note without complication. L femoral central attained per procedure note without complication. CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips. Pronounced deceased at 22:00.  MDM: Initial concern for but not limited to appendicitis, AAA, diverticulitis, renal stones, pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, toxic ingestion, ACS, obstruction, perforation, sepsis (2/2 PNA, UTI, meningitis, intra-abdominal infection), AAA, dissection, PE - as ED course progresses, differential narrows and consider more likely PEA arrest secondary to ACS, PE, dissection, AAA, necrotic pancreatitis, tension PNX (less likely). Considered but do not suspect seizures, stroke. Imaging studies reviewed - CXR with ETT in place, no acute pathology. CTA chest/A/P remarkable for massive proximal B/L PE. Labs reviewed. ECGs without STEMI, with sinus tach initially, LBBB after initial ROSC, and then AFib in RVR on subsequent ECG. Per above, patient suffered massive B/L PE, with subsequent cardiac arrest, despite heoric efforts including thrombolysis. Death called art 22:00.  Diagnosis: massive B/L PEs, PEA arrest.  Disposition: deceased.&#34;

Had been ruled out for ACS 6/18 in ED, CXR neg. Many of symptoms typical post-vaccination symptoms, but cough/DOE atypical. Patient also tested neg for COVID 6/22/21. Afebrile (fevers only lasted first 2 days after vaccination). 1 month later, symptoms are unchanged. I am repeating a D-dimer, CXR, CBC, INR. Patient has been unable to keep his job due to his ongoing symptoms. Patient has been very worried about symptoms, likely strong anxiety component contributing as well, but etiology of symptoms still unclear.  consulted ID, recommended further labs. Repeat CXR 7/26 clear, repeat D-dimer neg.

                                                The day after receiving the shot i was very tired.  Slept part of the day.  I am a runner and was unable to run that day but could tell i was very winded even going up and down stairs.  The rest of the week was unable to run from being winded.  Then after a week was able to slowly get back to my normal routine.  I had a calcium score scheduled for 7:00 am on May 19th.  I was called into my doctors office to be given the results the next week because my calcium scan came back fine...but doing the scan they found a 3mm nodule on my lung.  I have never had any type of lung issues.  I do not know that this is related to the shot.  But because of how my lungs felt for a week after the shot, i feel this could be related.  I am not a smoker and never have been.  They say the majority of these type nodules are formed from inflamation or infection.  At the time they told me about the nodule they also did my yearly physical.  Since i know some are getting inflamation around the heart...i&#39;m curious if there can also be inflamation around the lungs which would have given me the nodule.  At this point..the doctor plans to do a ct scan in one year to see if the nodule has grown.   I felt like i should report this since this may not be discovered by many others unless they just happen to go from some type of scan of the lungs.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

The next day I saw my Dr., she listened to my chest, and checked my blood pressure and it was 160/100. I have never had high blood pressure before. She prescribed losartan potassium 60 mg tablet. I take 1 every morning now. And cough medication: benzonatate 200 mg tablets 1 every 8 hour now. The cough and the blood pressure is still ongoing. There is no pneumonia. I had a Bilateral hip replacement, total hip replacement on both legs, it has become very sensitive and painful after the vaccine. I take the 4 Advils for the pain in my hips. The doctor is trying to determine if I&#39;m a long-hauler of  COVID related. I have never had Covid-19 virus, not to my knowledge.

An hour later had pain on my left flank (seemed like pain from the same area that I had previously had a Diverticulitis event.  Previous Diverticulitis event the pain gradually increased in that area.  This time it was immediate. Chills and Sweats (Fever) lasted until 7-8AM.  Started Antibiotics and diet Monday afternoon (2/15/21). Pain on my left flank lasted until I completed my Antibiotics Treatment 8-9 days later. 2. At some point within about 3 weeks of the 2nd Vaccination I noticed I was wheezing at night while I slept (it would wake me up).  I was not really short of breath, but while laying down would wheeze.  I had asthma as a child, but since I was  a teenager, I have not had any Asthma or Wheezing issues.  Doctor gave me a course of Steroids and Albuterol which I am still using daily.  It has gotten better but I still need the inhaler daily.

I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours.

I ingested the carvedilol 6.25mg, I felt dizzy but walked in the gas station to got a granola bar and chocolate milk drink went back to the car. Twenty five minutes after taking the first carvedilol, I felt no changes in heart rate &amp; shortness of breath and took an additional 6.25mg of carvedilol. I then called my wife and talk to her (and my children) about what was happening and where I was. I asked to call 911 if I loose consciousness. At about fity five-Sixty minutes went by and symptoms were unchanged  and I took third dose of 6.25 mg of cavedilol. At approximately 75-80 minutes after onset of symptoms my hear rate went down and shortness of breath improved to normal. I contacted my doctor the next day

A 53-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Apr2021 12:30 at age of 53-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high cholesterol, anxiety disorder, known allergies: Clonazepam (KLONOPIN), food allergies: sea bass and orange roughy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; ibuprofen taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, lot number EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 18Mar2021 11:00 AM at age of 53-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was currently 11 days out from receiving his second COVID vaccine and he was still having very strong side effects. This included an emergency room visit on 16Apr2021. He was generally very good health and he exercised regularly including running so these were very abnormal effects for him. Beginning one day after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19: 1. Strong chest pressure and fluctuating heartbeat. 2. Slower breathing and respiratory response. 3. Extreme fatigue &amp; very low energy (for example, walking up two flights of stairs made him very tired and spikes his heart rate, abnormal for him). 4. Loss of appetite and loss of weight. 5. Abnormally wide fluctuation of blood pressure while not exerting himself. For example, higher blood pressure readings (155/95) with a slower pulse (60) or the opposite scenario, (110/89) elevated pulse 98. 6. Difficulty relaxing and sleeping. 7. Nausea and some dizziness. 8. Stomach pain and diarrhea. 9. Headaches. 10. Low grade fever. As of 26Apr2021, it stated the day after the patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination (10Apr2021 12:00 PM), he began to have side effects which he expected to some extent. However, as of today, he has 17 days straight of side effects or perhaps an adverse event. His symptoms began mildly the day after but suddenly increased greatly within the next couple days and he had been dealing with this ever since. He had made two emergency room visits, seen his general practitioner, and as of today (26Apr2021) a cardiologist who ordered imaging. His symptoms range from, extreme fatigue, nausea, strong stomach and intestinal discomfort, weight loss, shortness of breath, sudden increased heart rates and high blood pressure readings, intense chest pressure and some pain, powerful involuntary shaking of my body that comes in waves, and pressure and pain in the back of his head at the cerebellum. His life was basically come to a screeching halt and he was searching for answers! The doctors he had spoken to were unclear as to what was wrong with him and why. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment received for the events. COVID tested post vaccination on 17Apr2021 included PCR and Nasal Swab, both showed negative result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203; expiration date: Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 18:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing lyme disease. There were no concomitant medications. The patient went through post- vaccination especially because he has Lyme disease. He has had this pre-existing autoimmune disease for 8, almost 9 years, he wants to add this information to the database. Caller states the first shot he would say was kind of catastrophic, the second shot, he will go into. Caller states the second shot, he showed up at the military vaccination place locally and they actually declined his ability to get it with them because of his first reaction even though he had the go ahead from his Lyme specialist and primary doctors. Caller states because of this, he went after four weeks instead of three and he went to a high risk clinic to protect him from anaphylaxis. He has received both doses, the first dose was horrendous and the second was quite easy. Caller states no reaction whatsoever with the second, though he still has remaining symptoms. Reporter Details: Caller states his legal name is (Name), he goes by (Name). Caller states he would prefer if company contacted him and also so that maybe they can warn people with autoimmune or Lyme that the first one is going to be kind of rough. Caller states he works with the public. Prescribing Healthcare Professional: Caller states unsure of email address. Caller states the only thing missing off the initial story is that all in all, the second shot was really good. Caller states he does have some very lingering issues still that he is going to be seeing the Lyme specialist about. Caller states the first dose, it&#39;s pretty intense. Caller states the second one, he had fatigue and neuropathy from the stupid autoimmune stuff. Caller states there is residual symptoms, but nothing like the initial ones. Caller states what he did was he just jotted some notes down about every third or fourth day up until the second shot just to detail each symptom. Caller states he only wrote about 5 days worth of little sentences. Caller states 27Feb2021, the first dose, it was a Saturday so by Monday 29Feb2021, it started with itching, burning rashes, so like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps, neuropathy- shooting pains in his fingers and toes that feels like bugs are crawling all over him, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Caller verifies all of these symptoms actually began on 01Mar2021. Itching, burning rashes: Caller states he would say they lasted about 2-3 weeks because he went to the walk-in to have them check and called his primary doctor and went into his primary and had him check. Caller states it ended sometime in Mar2021 and he has recovered completely. Neuropathy: Shooting pains in his fingers and toes: Caller verifies it began 01Mar2021. Caller states he would say he still has about 20% left. Caller states it is hard to sleep at night because he still gets itching and burning and stuff. Caller states it is persisting, but certainly not as bad. Headache: Caller verifies it started 01Mar2021. Caller states it ended Mar2021 and has recovered completely. Fatigue: Caller states began 01Mar2021. Caller states this is one of the bad ones he would say. Caller states he still, he would like to go for a walk or work out and he barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others. Caller states he can&#39;t workout or walk. Caller states if he goes up and down stairs, he&#39;s exhausted. Caller states that&#39;s definitely a lasting one. Caller verifies it is ongoing, persisting. Dizziness: Caller verifies it began on 01Mar2021 and is ongoing. Caller states when he walks he literally cannot turn his head quickly or he feels like he&#39;s going to throw up or pass out. Caller verifies it is persisting. Caller states he would say about 4 or 5 days later from getting the first shot, this was really interestingly weird, he had mouth sores that wouldn&#39;t heal and debilitating malaise and fatigue. Caller states malaise so bad he couldn&#39;t get through work, he could barely work. Caller states the mouth sores were so weird. Caller states everything he is telling company he has read about online. Caller states he has had canker sores from low immunity, but this was on the tip of his tongue, either side of the tongue tip, it came and went three or four times through the entire month. Caller states it was like his immune system was on the edge of crashing, then he would sleep a lot more. Caller states he would do whatever he could do to make it come back. Caller verifies this debilitating fatigue is different than overall fatigue that began 01Mar2021. Caller states the debilitating malaise began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Debilitating Fatigue; Debilitating Malaise: Caller states the debilitating fatigue also began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Caller states it is acute. Caller states ended sometime in Mar2021. Caller states recovered completely but is still left with some fatigue. Caller states recovered with lasting effects maybe. Caller says the other one, he could barely get up, he could barely work, he literally couldn&#39;t function. Caller states the overall fatigue has not left, it&#39;s ongoing. Mouth sores that won&#39;t heal: Caller states began around 004Mar2021 or 05Mar2021 and stopped sometime in Apr2021, it took about a month. Caller states he recovered completely. Caller states he just wrote what happened down about every 2 days up until 14Mar2021. Joint Pain: Caller states literally every single joint in his body was killing him and felt inflamed. Caller states it began around 03Mar2021 or 04Mar2021. Caller states joint pain is ongoing, but has improved. Air Hunger, shortness of breath upon exertion: Caller states if he went up and down a few stairs, he would breathe almost as if he was having an asthma attack, it was shortness of breath upon exertion and started about four days after. Caller states it began around 05Mar2021. Caller states he actually had it this morning, felt like he just walked up a flight of stairs. Caller states he is very physically fit, so that should not happen. Caller states it&#39;s ongoing and has improved. Numb Extremities: Caller states a week later from 01Mar2021 he had numb extremities. Caller states he started being very aware of the fact that his fingers and toes were starting to lose feelings on 08Mar2021. Caller states it resolved within a week on 15Mar2021. Caller states it was a weird sensation that happened for a while but is completely resolved now. Body Temperature Regulation Issues: Caller states two days later, he had body temperature regulation issues. Caller states he was cold when he should have been hot and hot when he should have been cold. Caller states began around 03Mar2021/04Mar2021 and is ongoing, but not terrible, it&#39;s probably the least of the issues and has improved. Heart was pounding out of his chest; face was flushed: Caller states a day or two later, his heart was pounding out of his chest and his face was flushed to the point where people were asking if he was okay. Caller states he felt like he got a quick burst of a run and then stood still. His face was visibly red and very aware of his heart beating out of his chest and this is with no exertion. Caller states he was laying on the couch and he could feel his face flush while doing nothing basically. Caller states began 02 or 03Mar2021 and just stopped a week ago around 12Apr2021. He recovered completely, for now, it seems. Caller states he went to (Clinic name) on (Address), he doesn&#39;t have the doctors name, it was a walk-in. Caller states they literally said no big deal, it&#39;s all side effects of the vaccine, they just said he&#39;s fine. Caller states they simply recommended anti-inflammatories, Tylenol, which was smart and he wishes he thought about it. They also recommended Benadryl to stop the reaction. Caller states it was very helpful, the Benadryl really helped a lot. Caller states there was also a good amount of insomnia because of all the symptoms, it would be close to impossible to sleep. Insomnia: Caller states it seemed to get worse, started a week later because it  was getting disconcerting to him so he couldn&#39;t sleep. Caller states it started 08Mar2021 and have had that on and off with Lyme. Caller states has struggled for years, is ongoing and is persisting. Caller states on 14Mar2021, he couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, completely weak and dizzy, his left leg and quad was spasming like when he had Lyme&#39;s, left knee itches, tingles, and burns and that&#39;s where he got bit by the tick and that&#39;s when he had his symptoms when he was acute. Caller states it resolved within 3 weeks after the initial onset of the shot. Caller states when he had Lyme initially, that&#39;s what he experienced, his left knee swelled, burned and itched, his left knee cap. Caller states ended 17Apr2021. Caller states its a situation where some of those are still there because of Lyme and some are gone. Caller states the knee cap stuff and can&#39;t get out of bed was gone on 17Apr2021. Caller states he has recovered completely. Caller states he still is weak and dizzy and his left leg and quad are still spasming, but it&#39;s better and is improved. Caller states on 20Mar2021, his left knee cap hurt, was twitching and tight, his left toe was numb, felt like something is chewing on his toe with a sensation of worms under the skin and sleep disturbances. Caller verifies the sensation of worms under the skin and something chewing on his toe is all related to neuropathy, which is still there. Caller states he had written down that on 20Mar2021, he was supposed to get his second shot at 1800, but was denied due to side effects he was experiencing and was rescheduled for 31Mar2021 at a local high-risk clinic. Caller states on 22Mar2021, he slept good, but was fairly weak all day. caller states he took a shower mid-afternoon, and couldn&#39;t get off the couch. Caller states basically all he did was take a shower and threw himself on the cough the whole day. Caller states he has written that he has the sensation of ants crawling over the top of his back, no desires to go outside, and light sensitivity. Caller verifies the ants crawling over the top of his back was also neuropathy, and he recovered completely within 3 weeks. Light Sensitivity: Caller states throughout the whole thing, had it today and is still ongoing and persisting. Caller states began sometime in Mar2021, its been the whole time. Caller states 28Mar2021, he only slept 6 hours and woke up completely fatigued, could not get out of bed until 2:00 in the afternoon, has a complete loss of appetite, had a drink and 2 eggs and laid down, couldn&#39;t move until 1930. Caller states got up, had a nutrition shake, he wasn&#39;t desiring solid foods whatsoever, had 100% malaise, fatigue, no appetite, and was dizzy. Loss of appetite: Caller states he has lost 7 pounds since the first shot. Caller states he wasn&#39;t really interested in eating. Caller states he has a natural desire to eat and nothing sounded good. Caller states started Mar2021, is ongoing, and has improved. Caller states 31Mar2021, he got the second shot, he had a little bit of irritation, tingling and burning at site and definitely a flushed face throughout the day, almost like a sunburn. Caller states he was joking with clients and said the first shot killed him and the second shot cured him. caller states after the second shot, he is 80% better but can list the remaining symptoms. Caller states what he is left with is fatigue, he does not have any energy to do anything other than work, sleep issues, neuropathy, and dizziness. Dizziness: Caller states the dizziness has been consistent and goes with the sleeplessness, ongoing since Mar2021 and is persisting. Irritation, tingling, and burning at injection site: Caller verifies the irritation, tingling, and burning is at the injection site of the second dose. Caller states it happened within a few hours on 31Mar2021 and resolved within a week on or around 07Apr2021. Covid Vaccine: First Dose: Caller verifies he received the injection in his left arm around 1800. Caller unsure of NDC. Covid Vaccine: Second Dose: Caller verifies he received the second dose on 31 Mar2021. LOT: ER8730, Expiry Date: They didn&#39;t write that down so caller unsure. NDC: Caller unsure of NDC. Caller unsure of dosage given. Caller states was given via injection in his right arm around 1300 or 1330. Covid Vaccine: Indication: Caller states first off he owns a business, he did it to be responsible to the public. Caller states he wants his business to appear as safe and compliant as possible. Caller states he definitely was afraid because of the Lyme disease. Concomitant Products: Caller states he made sure he did nothing before purposefully. Test Results: Caller states after the first shot, he went to (Name) family physician, they did a lot of blood work trying to make sure his inflammatory markers weren&#39;t going up, to make sure he wouldn&#39;t have issues. Caller states the good news was he was great, everything looked normal, there was nothing crazy in the blood work. Caller states they though the shots would have triggered an autoimmune response of Lyme. Muscle/Joint: He reports a bit of muscular/joint pain in the area where the shot is, if he goes to reach  The outcome of the event &#34;itching, burning rashes, like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps&#34;, &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;can&#39;t workout or walk&#34;, &#34;exhausted&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;face was visibly red&#34; was resolved in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;debilitating malaise&#34; was resolved with Sequel in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;Numb Extremities&#34; was resolved in 15Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;mouth sores&#34; was resolved in Apr2021, the outcome of the event &#34;face was flushed&#34; was resolved in 12Apr2021; the outcome of the event &#34;couldn&#39;t get out of bed&#34; &#34;left knee itches, tingles, and burns&#34; was resolved in 17Apr2021, the outcome of the event Back disorder was unknown, the outcome of the event &#34;complete loss of appetite&#34;, &#34;Joint Pain&#34;, &#34;Body Temperature Regulation Issues&#34;, &#34;barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others/Weak&#34; was resolving, the outcome of the other events was not resolved.

A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm at 53 years old on 20Mar2021 08:00 (Lot Number: EP7534) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure from 2018, he says he has had this for roughly 3 years. Concomitant medication included amlodipine at 5mg once a day for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date in 2018 and ongoing, he says he has been taking this for a few years, maybe 3 years. No additional vaccines were administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect or within 4 weeks. He was not sick at the time of vaccination previously. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He says he is just trying to get answers because what he experienced was very alarming to him. He got the vaccine at 8:00 in the morning. He says a student did it, she took a long time, she was very timid. He says she was being supervised by an RN. He experienced shortness of breath on 07Apr2021, he says it was in the morning that the shortness of breath started, because he did make an appointment to go the the COVID test, he got the COVID test around noon that same day. He says he was diagnosed with pericardial effusion requiring drainage and inflammation of the heart sac. He says he had fluid overload on the lungs that required IV diuretics. He says the symptoms started after the vaccine, and these symptoms were what was causing the shortness of breath. He says the fluid around the heart made the heart beat super fast to pump up blood. He says the fluid triggered the shortness of breath. He says when they removed fluid the breathing got easier but then it settled into the lungs. He says Tuesday he dropped off the cliff, Tuesday or Wednesday night, one of them, for two nights he was on oxygen, they gave him a diuretic for the lungs, after 12 hours he started feeling better, continued to get better and better after they moved the fluid from the lungs with Lasix through the IV. He says he doesn&#39;t fit the profile of someone who would develop these issues, he has no history, no cancer, no autoimmune disorders. He says they say well maybe it is the virus but the doctors currently have no specific answers for the caller. He says they told him that someone having this would be the profile of an IV drug user. He says he never uses drugs, he does not fit a profile like this. He says he wants to be fully vaccinated. He says the timing is suspicious with the vaccine shot. He says it is 50/50 on the doctor&#39;s opinions, half say to get the shot, the other half say don&#39;t do it. He says they say the second shot is worse. He says he is confused as to what to do, that he understands this is a big experiment, he wants the vaccine but not at the cost of another visit to the hospital. He says he was at the hospital on oxygen, he couldn&#39;t get out of bed for a day. He says the doctor said there was a study in (Withheld), the caller says he did a lot of research in the hospital for 6 days, that says the demographic is younger but it is heart issues with men for the heart with the Pfizer vaccine. He says they are studying it. He says a couple of doctors referred to that, the ones that say don&#39;t get the shot, not yet. He says he can&#39;t pinpoint it exactly. He says it could have been a fluke but the timing is very suspicious. He says that because of some of the side effects, his week in hospital, he was concerned for his life, he wants to be fully vaccinated but not at the cost of going though this or cost of killing him. He says he does not want to go through this again, he will not get vaccinated unless he is comfortable. He asks should he switch to (Withheld), is that a safer bet, (Withheld), should he just skip it all together or not. He says he knows they are a different type of vaccine. He says they had to remove fluid form his pericardial sac, he had 2 days of draining, they drained a liter from around the heart so it could beat normal again. He says apparently some of the fluid went to the lungs so he needed oxygen. He says this all happened Tuesday morning, he came back home yesterday, he looks pretty good. He says he just wants to do the vaccine and asks should he take the second one or not. He would like to get any information. He says the fluid in his heart was starting to build up on 05Apr2021 or 06Apr2021, he started getting symptoms that come and go. He says he was admitted to the hospital on 19Apr2021 and his procedure was on 20Apr2021 so his shortness of breath resolved the day after the procedure. He says he was hospitalized from 19Apr2021 to 25Apr2021. After reporting shortness of breath he says that was it, basically. He says he went to the nurse treatment center on 19Apr2021 because he thought it might be COVID but this event landed him in the hospital. The events required a visit to emergency room, he said he went to the emergency room on 19Apr2021 and a doctor told him he might not make it. The patient said he was scared and he didn&#39;t know why the doctor would have said that to him. He said he did not have an appointment date to physician office yet, he was waiting to get a call back. Relevant Tests included: Rapid COVID test, Date 07Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at Patient First Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at the hospital on admittance, Result negative. Standard COVID test, Date 19Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative. He says at the hospital there was a lot of tests done on his heart and lungs, nothing was coming back scary, they were coming back as perhaps viral markers. The outcome of shortness of breath was recovered on 21Apr2021, of other events was unknown.

Took Tylenol, the next day fever was gone but chest tightness and cough persisted.  On 5/11/21 checked into Urgent Care facility because fast heartbeat and chest tightness did not subside. Dr. checked my pulse (at 99 beats) and gave me a PCR test for Covid.  Coved test came back negative. On 5/16/21 at 1:00am, chest tightness felt like it was getting worse. Checked into Urgent Care ficility again. Dr. took a check x-ray and EKG. Both came back normal with nothing unusual found. Dr. prescribed Zithromax and Prednisone in case of bacterial infection and the Sterol to help with my breathing.

Breathing issues continues to get worse over time.  Went to urgent care doctor on June 4th.  They said my oxygen level was low and could hear wheezing in chest.  They did a chest x-ray and thought I might have pneumonia.  Gave me antibiotics.  Recommended to see primary care doctor.  Went to HCF on 6/7/2021.  Saw FNP.  She did blood work.  Scheduled me for a cat scan on  6/8.  Blood tests indicated d-dimer level was high.  Cat scan showed pulmonary embolisms in both lungs.  Went to hospital.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection Batch/Lot number: EW0150, Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Apr2021 (at the age of 53-year-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Time of the vaccination given was 12 or 1:00 PM. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, obese, hand was beginning hurt, carpal tunnel. Concomitant medications include allergy shots started on an unspecified date of 2019 for allergies. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks. 3 days later after receiving the Covid vaccine he got Covid on the 10Apr2021 and was diagnosed positive on the 11Apr2021. HCP advised to wait 2 months and start over with the first vaccine. No clinics want to do that. He went to two locations and they don&#39;t want to give him the first vaccine. They only want to give him the second dose. He went to the clinic and they were going to give him a second dose, but he was wanting to know if that was ok or if he would have to start all over. Patient wants Pfizers recommendation. He was way past 21 days. The patient stated he would want to start over if they don&#39;t know how good the second vaccine was if given that late. Patient was asking that this Pfizers recommendation. According to the CDC they are not allowed to give him three vaccines. He was not asking for three. He had to start over because this happened. They said they don&#39;t care, and they would just give him the second. He said he told them no and that his doctor told him that he needs to start again. They told him they don&#39;t care what his doctor says and that they know more than him. He figures he would go directly to the manufacturer and see what Pfizer says.

                                                Within several weeks, I started noticing what felt like heart palpitations that caused me to lose my breath and wheeze/cough.  I had called my primary care physician and saw them and said I wanted a visit with a cardiologist.  Just one week later, during a work call, it the event happened so severely that I started passing out.  Thus, I went immediately to the ER and checked myself in.  It was not until mid-July that I got to see a cardiologist, and my symptoms were much less frequent or severe by that time.  For several weeks though, it was very uncomfortable and unnerving.

Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).

The shortness of breath gets worse walking on stairs and the dysphony worsens when talk. I also noted a hotness sensation, but when used the thermometer the temperature was normal. When checked both lungs didn&#39;t have any abnormal sounds. On the absence of these symptoms, I started using Fluticasone with Salmeterol, that improved the shortness of breath, but it came back after 12-14 hours, requiring use of 2 inhalations mornings and nights, the dysphony was related to the hotness and light tiredness. I used the medicines from January the 16th to February 6, when noticed that the shortness of breath improved and didn&#39;t required the dose for the night, then stopped the dose for the morning. Regarding the hotness sensation, is still present but the dysphony disappeared.

                                                heart palpitations; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered in a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient had no medical history. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medication included erythromycin eye ointment. On the 17Jan2021 4PM, 3 days after being vaccinated the patient got heart palpitations and shortness of breath. This continued until the 23Jan2021 when he stopped having the heart palpitations. However, the shortness of breath has continued. It started out as light shortness of breath and has evolved into moderate. He was not gasping for air but it was uncomfortable enough where he has had to take time off of work. He was seen by a doctor on 27Jan2021. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The patient had Nasal swab/ SARs CoV-2 RNA Real time RT PCR on 25Jan2021, and the result was negative. The outcome of the event heart palpitations was recovered on 23Jan2021 and shortness of breath was not recovered.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient was nervous prior to the vaccination. Once he received the vaccine he asked to use the bathroom and while he was in there he felt nauseous and came out of the bathroom. He then felt extremely light headed and nauseous that he almost collapsed to the floor. The pharmacist and myself (an immunizing pharmacy intern) rushed to check on him. He reported a little difficulty breathing but was still conscious. We proceeded to call 911 and gave one dose of 0.3 mg Epi-pen. After about 5 minutes he felt much better and was able to sit up. He reported that he never lost complete consciousness but was extremely nauseous and lightheaded. Patient handed over to EMS.

When I woke up the next day, the hives and rash covered everywhere except my head.  I took a shower and it became hard to breath, my eyes were very light sensitive, nauseous, and very dizzy.  I tried to make it back to my bed, but fell twice.  The second time I fell I stayed on the ground for about 5 minutes.  When I got up, everything was back to normal.  I left soon after to the Hospital emergency room to get checked.

Massive headache, soreness, weird shooting pains in my leg, sweats and chills and nausea, and now the racing heart and shortness of breath.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

The pain is not constant but rather at random times throughout the day.  This sudden, sharp, needle-like pain was felt mostly on the following dates: Tuesday, 04/13/2021 (both lungs felt pain twice early in the morning around 1:00 AM and a few more times in the afternoon), Sunday, 04/18/2021 (pain felt twice only on right lung around 2:00 PM), Monday, 04/19/2021 (pain felt on right lung around 10:00 AM and again around 4:00 PM), and on Tuesday, 04/20/2021 (pain felt on right lung around 1:30 PM).

                                                The first night I had itching down my left arm and palm of my hands, my wrist. Then my hands swelled up quite large. It lasted about 3-4 hours and then completely went away. The following day, the same thing happened but this time it was both hands around midday. I had some pain, but it was not severe. This lasted 3-4 hours again and went away. The next day, both my armpits swelled up profusely and itched. I had light itching on both arms and swelling again. On my back, the pain shot down my back and in my left hip. The pain was not extreme, it was just uncomfortable. This lasted a few hours and went away as usual. About 24 hours and nothing happened. Then my left hand and palm started itching lightly. My tongue and mouth began itching and swelling profusely to a point where i couldn&#39;t eat anything. The next day, my heels started itching on both feet and my toes swelled up. I saw my doctor who provided me steroids. They lasted 5 days and I had no symptoms while on the steroids. When the steroids ended, my throat started to swell and my mouth as well. It got a little difficult to breathe but by the time I got ready to go to the ER it had subsided. This was accompanied by lite swelling and itching in my left hand. The same symptoms keep occurring. I went to an allergist/immunization specialist. I am now on my 3rd run of steroids. As soon I am off the steroids, my symptoms return. I have also been on antihistamines which seemed to help a little in conjunction with the steroids. Without the steroids, they do not help.

I didn&#39;t connect the dots to the shot until i read about the cases in another cou ntry. I am an avid cyclist who rides over 100 miles a month and I noticed my athletic performance was suffering greatly and I would wake up most nights from a sound sleep with chest pain.

I did end up vomiting 4 times, I had an upset stomach the whole time and had to stay in bed as a result. I could tell my voice was going. I ended up with laryngitis, I had no voice for 3 days. My throat was sore and then I began having upper respiratory pain. By Friday, I went to an urgent care. They gave me an antibiotic and said I should be significantly better in 72 hours. I went back on Monday because I was not a whole lot better. They did a COVID test that came back negative. By Wednesday of that week I was quite a bit better but I still had some congestion. By that weekend I was better. It lasted about a week and a half.  The most important part to me is that I never get sick. I got two illnesses quite close to each other and the only varying factor was receiving the vaccine.

                                                No immediate adverse reaction, however, began developing nightly fevers/profuse sweating on June 11.  This continued for two weeks with increasing symptoms of loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, tingling sensation on scalp before going to ER.  Visited urgent care on June 16 and bloodwork results indicated elevated white blood cell count and eosinophil count.  There was a question as to whether patient had been subjected to a tick bite, so doxycycline was prescribed.  After several days, patient returned to urgent care for follow-up bloodwork (June 20th).  Results showed WBC and eosinophil count continued to escalate.  He went to ER on June 25th and was admitted to the hospital for 5 days.  During his visit at Hospital, he was seen by a team of specialists:  cardiologist, pulmonologist, hematologist, infectious disease doctor.  Multiple tests were run, as the doctors started broad to eliminate certain diagnoses - i.e., bone marrow biopsy, heart cath, CT scans, x-rays, thoracentesis, etc.  Patient had fluid around his heart and lungs and was diagnosed with myocarditis.  He had no previous heart issues nor family history of heart issues.  Test results indicated no abnormal  blockage or other issues, other than inflammation and his heart strength was at 27%.  I am unable to access his account, as it was disabled after his death.  An autopsy is being performed and results are pending; however, the question(s) at large:  what was the condition of his heart at the time of his death and was this vaccine-related?  Did his myocarditis get worse?  Did his heart muscle weaken further and rupture?    Please let me know if the autopsy results are needed and where to send them.

About 3 hours after the vaccine I started having sharp pain (like 8 or 9 on a scale of 1-10) running down the insides of my legs. It felt like lightning was running through my body. I tried to sleep Friday as well as the weekend, and the pain was intense. I had to limit and stop all exercise, and to-date, I can only walk for limited times before I feel pain in my legs again. I have also long-term lethargy and tireness, and find I am sleeping 12-16 hours a day. Prior to Covid vaccine, I would only sleep 4-6 hours a night.

No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

A 55-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm on 17Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mixed hyperlipidemia. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Jan2021 via intramuscular. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal and sinus congestion, rash on chest and face, angioedema of lips and periorbital area and wheezing. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received an OTC antihistamine and monitored the condition.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological association and known product safety profile, a causal relationship between event angioedema and BNT162B2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

But that 2nd day after, G.I. issues began middle of nite. So fatigued &amp; short-of-breath, barely made it to dialysis, where they put me on oxygen. All during treatment, BP fluctuated 90-170, temp 96-101, chills (shivering!), continued fatigue &amp; weakness, even after leaving - they wanted to give me antibiotics &amp; send me to e.r.!!! Staff did collect blood sample for culture (result in 24 hrs &#43; neg). I refused antibiotics and e.r., convinced it was vax reaction, and I was right, all normal another day later.  Anxious bout 2nd shot ??

Next morning dizzy and weak, and now whenever I put my head back I get dizzy and still when I go to bed dizzy when I?m laying down and when I move on my side. The dizziness does not stop. I?m also experiencing shortness of breath as a result from my daily walks, this never happened before.

                                                I was at the Neuroscience center and in the auditorium shorty after.  Where I started to sweat, blurred vision, very difficult to breath and losing some motor skills.  Luckily I got up in time and went to one of the nurses up front that got me to a waiting area to cool down, some water and to breathe without the mask.  Probably stayed about 30 minutes as my vitals were pretty low before returning to normal.  I will say it was pretty hot and a little crowded in there and the nurses all said it&#39;s been happening a bit with the heat in there. And it was about 11:40am so I only had crackers in the morning.

It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes.

A 55-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number, Expiration date, NDC and UPC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jun2021 at 11:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Regarding lot number patient stated that it looks like EW, patient thought he was not sure if it was 6185 or 0185, not sure it looks like 0 but it looks like 6 too but patient think it was 0. The patient medical history included shortness of breath, sleep apnea and kidney disease (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient sees a doctor for lot of conditions one was for shortness of breath and sleep apnea and sees a neurologist for Bph. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient explained he was reluctant from getting vaccinated and nervous before the shot. On 06Jun2021, after patient took the shot, probably around 11:30 in the morning, patient was same, soon after 5 min maybe more, patient got a sensation on the left side of his tongue 5-10 mins, then  kind of a weird taste came to his mouth, patient started to get a little dizzy, a little light headedness, weakness in his chest and both his arms, got shortness of breath but had been seeing a doctor for shortness of breath prior taking the Covid shot and had kind of reluctant of taking the shot but some other issues going on side,  patient decided to take it, a couple of hours after the shot, patient had a headache, had the diarrhea. Patient described the weird taste like having a penny in his mouth. Patient explained he consulted a doctor on that Monday (07Jun2021), who said she encountered patients who also had the sensation on their tongues following vaccination, and that it was normal. Today (08Jun2021) patient had feeling just a little bit of nausea and patient kind a feel like a little brain fog, it was just his head doesn&#39;t feel right, the major concern was says some things risks factors and some of them had severe reactions, patient had a reaction difficulty in breathing, dizziness and feel little bit weakness, patient kind of a felt like his throat was going to close and he won&#39;t say he had any difficulty in swallowing, but it was not normal. Patient developed symptoms which spooked and scared him. Patient did not have his lab test but was constantly going to patient had just had right heart catheter right two weeks ago, you know last for him, patient was supposed to take another lab test to conduct at the end of the month for cholesterol, but patient saw neurologist for kidney disease. Events did not improve, patient just had this brain fog you know. Patient had to call a doctor after he got home, they did not prescribe him anything, patient mean he did bunch of appointment with doctor with the phone as soon as he got home from taken a Covid shot he was little worried. Patient stated he was concerned about getting the second dose of vaccine scheduled on 27Jun2021. Patient stated he will not be able to consult his doctor before the vaccination appointment and was not able to get further assistance from a pharmacist. Patient repeated he does not know what to do about the second dose. Patient was kind of reluctant taking the next shot, if he was going to feel the something like this again, he don&#39;t want to, as he already had uneasy you know just had and patient did not had difficulty in breathing all of time this comes and go,  from the sentence he described it says on pamphlet that there was severe reaction to the shot and don&#39;t want to take the second shot and then end up in hospital because patient had more from it so his question was he was afraid to take the second shot. Patient don&#39;t had answer to that he means he would like to talk to somebody who can give him information kind of help me to relax little bit if it was normal and in in response it was responded that decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by the company. Patient was referred to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection, as healthcare provider knows his health situation and had access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of brain fog was not recovered and outcome for other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

Patient medical history allergy to Penicillin diagnosed 2 years ago. He was advised as a child he was allergic to it, but the local medical provider wanted to actually prove if he was actually allergic and he was tested to verify. He was also allergic to the carrier that they give it to you in.

He saw in an article that a man who was hospitalized, they gave him Pepcid, and epinephrine, and Benadryl. So he took 3 tums, and two Benadryl and within a few hours symptoms decreased and felt fine. Looking at the vaccination facility where we got the vaccine, it states, there was a remote chance of severe allergic reaction. He wasn&#39;t hospitalized, etc. He did reach out, because he have tested for Penicillin reaction, he spoke to his allergy doctor, so they aren&#39;t very helpful. they said to front load with an antihistamine. They consider a severe allergic reaction if he were hospitalized and intubated.

Within 5 minutes of getting shot, he had the dizziness and heart racing. It lasted 5-10 minutes. It felt like his heart flip flopped and it could have just been an increase in heart rate. The difficulty breathing happened after he came home and it was about 2 hours after the shot. Before that, he had a headache that only lasted a few minutes and it went away. Then an ear ache, which was 5 minutes after that. Then he had a scratchy throat and that went away, then the breathing portion of it kind of started that day and it continued and got worse until the next morning. It felt like he had gas and/or reflux type feeling and it was harder to take a deep breath. He saw online where someone had been treated for the same thing and was given Epinephrine, Pepcid and Benadryl. He does not know the person and read about this individual that was treated for it. He does not have any information to report for this person. Patient stated he took 3 Tums and 2 Benadryl and it resolved within a couple of hours the following morning from having taken the shot. He was allergic to penicillin diagnosed previously and was concerned about getting the shot but they said he would be fine. He had dizziness, and heart racing that lasted 10 minutes.

                                                Patient is a 55 y.o. yo male presenting to the ED with fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and poor appetite per patient&#39;s son-in-law. Patient received Covid vaccine on April 25, 2021 and about 3 days later, started to have symptoms that they thought were just postvaccination symptoms.  Patient was having decreased appetite, fatigue and generally did not look well.  The following week, patient was tested for work and resulted as positive for COVID-19 at that time.  He then presented to the ED on May 8th, was admitted initially to the floor but had progressive decompensation of his hypoxemia and was transferred to the ICU on May 12th. He was intubated and subsequently cannulated for VV ECMO due to hypoxia. He remained on the circuit until 6/26/21 when he was successfully decannulated. He was still ventilator dependent and transferred to LTAC on 7/6. I was just asked by one of his care team members yesterday to submit this case to VAERS as he had no risk factors for such severe COVID disease other then his age of 55. He had normal BMI and no PMH. The concern from staff is that his vaccination may have not only failed to protect the patient, but could have boosted the virus&#39;s ability to infect cells; this concern is based on original vaccine and spike protein trials published back in 2005.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

Two days later I started having diffuse sporadic and intermittent tingling on various parts of my body.  That lasted about 2 days in its greatest severity.  On day 6 post vaccine, I was walking in an airport and developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath out of proportion to my level of exertion.  This chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia with minimal exertion (a flight of stairs.  A walk to the end of driveway.) has persisted since then.  A cardiac w/u with Echo and  treadmill stress ECHO were negative.  I also have intermittent fatigue, headaches, and a mild &#34;brain fog.&#34;

                                                On Thursday April 1, 10 days after the vaccine (1st shot)  I began to experience itch hives all over my body.  I took Benadryl at 2 pm and 8 pm to relieve the symptoms. It helped. At 7 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  I took Claritin to relieve symptoms but it was not effective. At 9:15 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  my lips and cheeks began to go numb, and it felt as if my throat and tongue were swelling.  At 9:30 am. I checked in to the ER.  They monitored my condition and indicated my blood pressure and oxygen levels were normal. At approximately 10:15 am, my mouth began to feel normal again. While at the ER, the  doctor checked out my hives and gave me Prednisone. She also gave me a prescription for 4 days of Prednisone, 50 mg tablets,  and advised to continue taking Benadryl to relieve symptoms. I have taken Prednisone once a day for past couple days and Benadryl 3 times a day. Hives are still present today Sunday April 4, 2021 but milder than previous days.[Not certain if this is important, but on  day 3 and 4 after the vaccine, I reported dizziness on mobile app check-in. The dizziness went away by day 5. I had no other symptoms appear until day 10 reported here.

                                                Inflamation and pain on left side of the body, beginning in the arm/shoulder and spreading to neck and left tonsil.  Tonsil swelling was quite pronounced by 2am (nearly twelve hours after the injection) and blocked the airway when head was turned to the left, necessitating a makeshift pillow brace to keep head turned to the right overnight.  Tonsil swelling began to diminish by about 6am and only slight enlargement remains thirty hours after injection.  Additionally, a low-grade fever began at about 10 pm (~7 hours after injection) and reached a maximum of 100.5 degrees F approximately twenty-four hours after the injection.  By twenty-eight hours, temperature was within normal limits (though still nearly a degree higher than typical for this patient).  As of this writing, some thirty hours after the injection, headache, neck ache, and eye-ache persist, but none is severe.  Symptoms appear to be continuing their improvement.  I (the patient/recipient) hope the second installment of the vaccine is no worse than this one.  The only truly alarming symptom was the swollen tonsil and some thought was given to seeking medical attention, but the pillow brace seemed to do the trick for keeping the airway open, so no assistance was sought.   I have no doubt that these short-lived symptoms are much better than actual disease and I will not hesitate to follow up with the second vaccine installment?but I will monitor the tonsil situation very carefully.

If he was too happy or too nervous get upset. He can eat spicy food, not super hot, but he can eat anything and it doesn&#39;t go crazy. He has a little bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing.

Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after vaccination, I experienced sudden onset of tachycardia (heart rate ~130-150) which continued into the morning (April 1st 2021). The tachycardia transitioned into atrial flutter (confirmed by an EKG in the cardiologists office that afternoon)  with associated shortness of breath (secondary to the cardiac arrhythmia).  I had a cardio version that afternoon (4/1/2021, 4:00pm)  and converted to normal sinus rhythm. I was given a rhythm and rate modifier medication and anticoagulant.   Prior to the COVID vaccination,  I had been symptom free for 3 years from my atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

                                                Approximately 1-2 minutes after injection, my throat began to close and I was having difficulty breathing and speaking. Dizziness followed. I told the attendant that I needed help. They knew that I had my epipen with me. From that time on, all I recall was asking someone to use the pen. An employee successfully administered the epipen. I was then placed on the floor with my head raised as I could no longer swallow or breathe. All that I can recall from that point was speaking with paramedics at the CVS and was feeling successful results from the epi pen. I was taken to Rockledge Medical ER where they took me in immediately and administered steroids and other antihistamines.

This is the same affect I have when I breath in cooked, steaming mushrooms on pizza or other cooked foods. I informed a nurse nearby about it and she had another nurse  come over and talk to me.  They asked  me if I wanted to go to the Emergency Room at the hospital and I declined, thinking it would subside, and because I was there with a woman whom I am one of her home care providers.. I did relaxation exercises and drank water to relax and it helped a little but after leaving, I went to a pharmacy and purchased Benadryl and took a 20ml dose.  Within about 30 minutes I was feeling better and the next day my chest felt fine but my throat still bothered me; I assumed my throat muscles were still sore from the swelling.

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 57 years, on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0170) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis, allergies, hay fever, allergies to grasses, cheese and weeds; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN) taken for autoimmune thyroiditis, start and stop date were not reported and an unspecified Antihistamine. The patient stated that 45 minutes later (26Apr2021) he stated that his face was flushed, his heart was beating fast, he was wheezing and had difficulty breathing but, not severe. He states that these conditions were not serious enough to seek medical attention and reports that they were gone by the end of the next day. The patient reported 5 hours after shot at his symptoms were at about 50 percent of what they were, By the next morning, they were down to about 10 percent and by the end of the day, on 27Apr2021, they were gone. The patient would like to know if this will keep him from getting his second dose of the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: increase on 26Apr2021. The outcome of the events was recovered on 27Apr2021.

On an unknown date, the patient experienced had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation), steroid induced diabetes, lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs, weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs, rash, diarrhea, and leg healing (limb discomfort). In 2021, patient weight was up by 4 lbs since discharge from hospital. The action for nifedipine in response to the events was unknown. The action for methylprednisolone in response to the events was unknown. The action for treprostinil diolamin in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events COVID-19 pneumonia, drug ineffective, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia , and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, events of COVID-19 pneumonia, Drug ineffective, Fever, Diarrhea could be related to the suspected drug of BNT162B2. All the other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  The reported events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Nifedipine.  The events of Diabetes steroid-induced is most likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus. All the other events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Medrol.   Medical history of ongoing Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH/ High BP disorder/ increased pressure of pulmonary circulation), ongoing Systemic lupus erythematosus, and ongoing Dyspnoea may provide explanations for some of the events (such as Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Volume overload, Mitral regurgitation, and Oedema peripheral).   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F in 2021. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID-19 swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight in Apr 2021 since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea, and limb discomfort. Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded. Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities. Information on the batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known safety profile, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drug ineffective, COVID-19, pneumonia, rash, pyrexia and diarrhoea cannot be excluded. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was secondary to COVID-19, therefore was also considered as related to BNT162B2. The other events were considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2. Steroid diabetes was considered as related to methylprednisolone and other events were unrelated to methylprednisolone. Oedema peripheral and limb discomfort were considered as related to nifedipine and other events were unrelated to nifedipine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 58-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 17:30 (at the age of 57-years-old) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 02Feb2021and experienced cardiac blockage. The patient did not take any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Apr2021 the patient experienced a blook clot, blockage in the left anterior descending artery and symptoms of shortness of breath. The events were reported as serious (life threatening). It was reported that 15Apr2021, emergency trip to ER, blockage in the Left Anterior Descending artery.  This blockage was only 40% blocked in Feb2021, and suddenly in April became 99% blocked. Dr suspected a blook clot when symptoms of shortness of breath appeared suddenly. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care.

                                                About 4 days after second shot, I noticed I had bumps on by back side.   They did not itch.   I though they were from bike riding - chafing.    But they moved around.   10 days after, my lip started to swell pretty badly while I was in a meeting.   Got online with doctor was told to go to hospital.  Anaphylaxis was the diagnosis.    They gave standard care - steroids, antihistamine, pepcid, etc.    Issue went away including the bumps on behind.    Was told to go my doctor. Went to my doctor.   Said dont worry, likely will not come back again.   Just a reaction of some type.      Next night lip swelled up - other side of mouth.  Online doctor said to go emergency room.    Back to emergency same treatment - more steroids, pecid, antihistamine.   Back  to my doctor and he sends me to alergist.   I have never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life.   Allergist said the reaction is due to the covid shot and making my immune system go crazy.   He put me on regimen of pepcid and antihistamine.    Seems to work for about a week - but then the hives came back.   More swelling of the face (lips, eyes) but none bad enough to go to hospital.    Taking meds 3 to 4 times a day (pepcid and antihistamine).     Had swelling in the ankle which the doctor said basically hives gone crazy.   Then the hives got worse - and itching.   Covered most of my body.    The hives on the bottom of the feet felt like walking on air pillow packaging material.    Dr puts me back on steroids.    Go through this process twice with steroids.    Dr said we would have to go the route of Xolair.   Received first injection three weeks ago.    But after shot had bad hives again with itching this time  - more steroids.     Then things sort of leveled out - still had hives but not a large - and no itching _ thank goodness.     But then on 7-2-21 I woke up with severe swelling of the face - and into the throat.    Had difficulty swallowing.    Back to emergency room again - more shots and Epinephrine.     They prescribe more steroids and epi pen just in case because the reaction was so severe.    Second shot of Xolair is in one more week - hopefully gets things under control.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 57 years old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at the age of 57 years)(Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included covid-19 from 27Nov2020 to an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took allegra and experienced allergies. Patient historical vaccine included Shingrix (he got Shringrix closer to 2 months ago). It was reported that, caller would like to know why he got sicker from the covid vaccine than from the natural infection itself which he had 27Nov2020. DSU: E-transmitting possible duplicate AE as caller stated they already reported AE to previous agent. Report# #. Caller states &#39;how do I have more symptoms than when I actually caught the virus?&#39; after receiving the 1st dose of the covid vaccine. It was not anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction as his shortness of breath happened 1-2 days after receiving the dose and today was the 5th day and he was starting to feel better. Caller used the term (Withheld) information referring to information he has received so far. Unclear from who exactly. Additional Context: States he was calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine and was calling to report severe side effects he experienced last week and for some questions he had. States he had COVID four months ago on 27Nov2020 for about 2 weeks it took to shake it and he was no worse for wear but had 103 degree Fahrenheit temperature, lost 13 pounds, had a cough that drug on and he figured he was building immunities. States he does not know how long the immunity would last from having covid so he got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and took the 1st dose on 31Mar2021; states the vaccine made him sicker with more symptoms and he was worse with the vaccine than he was with the actual disease covid. HCP information: Caller declined to provide HCP information and states he feels that is not necessary. Reporter details: Caller declined to provide email address. States by the evening on 31Mar2021, he had a headache, a very sore arm and never had a vaccine or shot that hurt as much as the Pfizer COVID Vaccine did; no further details provided. States what he experienced was listed as potential side effects and by that evening, he was feeling shivers, had a temperature, it made him really tired, pounding headache and elevated pulse; states his fever got up to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and he has probably hotter than that when he checked his temperature. Caller states these symptoms lasted through about 2 days; states the fever resolved with Tylenol and has not taken it this morning and kind of had leftovers and was trying to shake it; states he had 3-4 days of Tylenol and last night it seems to take the fever out. States the elevated pulse was up by 30 and he clarified to state his pulse usually runs normally by his wrist 55-75 resting heart beat and his pulse was 87 for about three days and the Pfizer vaccine jacked him up. States he had muscle joints, aches and pains and chills and doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine caused the fever or how severe but he had to get in bed and the 2nd day he did not get up. States the injection site was swelling and had pain and he had swollen lymph nodes. States if he had not felt better on Saturday morning he would have gone to the urgent care or to his HCP but he started to feel a little better. States the Pfizer vaccine caused a cough and shortness of breath for about 2 of the three days after he got the vaccine. States the elevated pulse struck him as strange and he did not experience this with the covid he had last fall and he did have the cough last fall with covid after Thanksgiving but was not short of breath and was able to keep exercising at that time and going through that hit him harder with the vaccine. Caller states he slept in his chair which cleared his lungs and it really surprised him that this occurred. States he takes vitamins and an allergy pill Allegra and takes Tamsulosin in the morning for his prostate deal and has taken all of these for years and started the Allegra probably last month since it was spring and he has allergies. States he got the 1st dose of Shingrix weeks earlier than the Pfizer vaccine but does not know the date; states he got Shringrix closer to 2 months ago when he had his annual physical and follow up and checked before scheduling the Shingrix and was told as long as it was two weeks apart from the Pfizer vaccine he was good and thought it might be around 6 weeks that he had the Shingrix and the HCP is his primary doctor and it was Dr. (Withheld). States he tried to do the online filing with the CDC website from the sheet they gave him but the website did not work and when the channels and numbers don&#39;t work it wastes everyone&#39;s time. States he got the Pfizer vaccine and the Shingrix vaccine in different arms on purpose. States his questions are if he can&#39;t get the disease from the Pfizer vaccine, why did he get additional symptoms that were more severe than when he had the disease covid; what is the level of effects with one dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and he would not have taken it if he knew how severe he would react and is not planning on getting the 2nd dose; if this is normal and was it expected and Pfizer is keeping quiet to coax everyone to get the vaccine right now he is not taking the 2nd dose, so what is good for the 1st and he feels like he had a booster with his 1st dose and feels like he had 2 doses since he actually had covid prior to the vaccine; people his age are older and have more severe side effects with the 2nd dose he has read and maybe this is the 2nd dose so why would he get the 2nd dose. Caller states he will take his chances on getting the disease. States he thinks it had been more than a month since he had the Shringrix vaccine and states he has no lot number, expiry date or NDC to provide. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included on an unspecified date, shake: 103 fahrenheit, shake 102.2 fahrenheit, heart rate: up by 30, heart rate: 87. Therapeutic measures were taken as a r Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of event fever got up to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The outcome of the events fever got up to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit was recovered on 02Apr2021, shortness of breath was recovering, for other events outcome was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

On Saturday 3/27,21, almost 4 days later, at about 1:00 PM, felt hives breaking out on my sides.  It traveled up to my lower armpits, but never went into my arm areas.  Later that day, it traveled down side of legs, but then dissipated.  I went to bed about 9:30 PM that night with only slight discomfort. At 1:30 AM on Sunday 3/28/21, I awoke with severely swollen lips and face.  My breathing began to get difficult, so I immediately headed to the ER at  (about 30 minutes away). They at first started to give me a dose of Benedryl, but I explained to them that I am allergic to it.  I then instead received some Prednisone and immediately the swelling subsided.  Dr.  prescribed 15 pills over a 5-day span to totally clear up the reaction.

At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

He swallowed a few times but was difficult to do so.  It then eased up and then 30 minutes later when he was getting up to leave he was light headed.  He walked out and got to the car, came home and still felt a little light headed, sat around for a couple of hours and was doing better.  He went outside to do a few things and was stumbling around and went back into the house.  He went to take a shower and still had the bandaide on his arm, took the bandaide off and while driving off he saw that he had a rash the size of a 50 cent piece around 7:30.  He got up the next morning and the rash was gone, the dizziness was gone and everything was fine.  He did not take anything for his reaction.

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021380129 same patient, different product(dose)/event

                                                On April 30, 2021, I received the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine which was 3 weeks after receiving the 1st dose. Then on May 3rd, I experienced pronounced shortness-of-breath while at work lifting objects up to 20 lbs and walking short distances of 20 to 40 m on flat ground. Then on May 4th, 2021, I went into a nearby Urgent Care Clinic (UCC) with shortness-of-breath and exertional dyspnea as the main symptoms.  At the UCC blood tests were done along with EKG and chest x-ray. Blood tests revealed several results that were not within standard ranges: troponin (1.25 ng/mL), BNP (5130 pg/mL), D-dimer (1320 ng/mL FEU), and C-reactive protein (75.5 mg/L). I was told that I had congestive heart failure and NSTEMI. UCC then directed me to go to the Emergency Department (ED) at a nearby hospital.   In the ED, more tests were done: EKG, CT scan chest (no blood clots were found in the lungs), and cardiac ultrasound (estimated ejection fraction 40-45%). That evening I was transferred to the main hospital for further observation and tests. Not much happened on May 5th and I was not seen by a doctor until 5pm. Then early in the morning of May 6th, I experienced chest pain which lasted between 5 and 10 minutes. I was given oral nitroglycerine. My primary care physician (PCP) and a cardiologist elected to move forward with an angiogram. On May 6th, I underwent cardiac catheterization (CC). The CC report states: (a) 2nd Diag lesion is 50% stenosed (b) Mid RCA to Dist RCA lesion is 80% stenosed,(c) RV branch lesion is 80% stenosed, (d) RPDA lesion is 80% stenosed. Likely spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the mid to distal RCA and postal to mid PDA status post PCI with 2 Xience drug-eluting stents.   Post-angiogram&#43;angioplasty tests were done, including carotid artery ultrasound (results within normal limits. No hemodynamically significant stenoses) and MRI brain (punctate foci of restricted diffusion in both cerebral hemispheres. Multiple vascular distributions w/o larger territorial infarct suggest emboli). Other blood test results were: antinuclear antibody (ANA) IFA screen (positive), BNP (8631 pg/mL). I was released from the hospital on May 8, 2021. Follow-up care included cardiac rehab therapy and consultations with the cardiologist, PCP, a neurologist and rheumatologist. Incidentally, 12 days after the angiogram and angioplasty, I experienced temporary numbness and loss of movement in my right arm which lasted no more than a minute, indicative of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Root cause investigations focusing on SCAD and TIA are on-going.

A 58-year-old male patient received a dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0612), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 17Apr2021 (at the age of 58-year-old) at dose number unknown as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure (other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination: High blood pressure medication). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 17Apr2021 the patient experienced major chest pain, and was gasping for air to, was in afib, the patient struggled to get out of bed to feed himself. Re-ported Event: patient received the vaccine early morning of 17Apr, and carried on his day, that night is when the symptoms came. The 2 symptoms that later sent patient to the hospital a few days later as patient explained. Patient had major chest pain and was gasping for air to breath. It was getting worse then out of nowhere, it stopped. And about 10 minutes later it hit patient again. This was a never-ending cycle all night long back and forth symptoms of intense chest pain and gasping for any air at all. By morning the symptoms had faded away. Carried on patient day when night came, they symptoms where back, not near intense as the night before, but still severe. This happened for a few more days and then patient went to his Dr, because the breathing was a major problem. Patient went to the Dr and she sent patient to the ER instantly. They ER said patient was in Afib and never had this or any history in the family. This has changed patient life, patient carrier. To this day patient struggle getting out of bed to feed himself.

I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

Shot Info:  from 3/5 10am to 3/6, no issues, I didn&#39;t even feel the shot, no soreness or other symptoms.  woke up at 2am (first noticed):  Very sore arm, Sore from head to toes, headache, sever chills/shaking, very tired, severe shortness of breath, joints (knees, hips, wrist) constant (not overly severe) pain. Severe symptoms lasted for 24 hours before starting to taper off, felt pretty good by Sunday 3/7 12pm/Noon. My chills were so bad, just getting up to go to the restroom 15 ft away, didn&#39;t know if I could make it back to the bed. Headaches was the last thing to go.

A 59-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EM6208), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15Mar2021 11:00 (received at 59-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient just got his second Pfizer shot Monday 12Apr2021 10:45 am (lot number: EW0162) administered in Arm Right, and he got his first one on 15Mar2021. He wants to report what he thinks is a side effect. He does not know if it is related or not, but at the end of Mar2021/ beginning of Apr2021, he started having excess mucous. He has fits where he is trying to cough up mucous for 45 minutes. Ever since it started there has been a lot of mucous. He has been taking Benadryl and stuff like that. He headed to urgent care on 11Apr2021 but decided to go to the ER (emergency room) instead because he was having a mucous coughing spell. They checked for pneumonia, but it was negative. The chests x-ray was clear with no pneumonia. They are saying it is allergies, but he has never had a reaction like this with mucous.  He has been wearing his mask too. He knows the allergy season is supposed to be bad, but they said on the news the masks were actually helping with the allergies. That people were having less symptoms. They were contributing it to allergies, but he has never had them this way before. He wants to report because he is thinking maybe it was something from having the vaccine. He thinks the mucous first started the end of Mar2021 or the first day of Apr2021. He went to ER on 11Apr2021. He also went back and forth with the doctor. They gave him allergy medicine. The ER gave him codeine cough syrup and Allegra D. His GP has him on Sudafed now, Flonase, Allegra, and Benadryl. He has fits at night nothing seems to change. He is not sleeping because he is constantly choking and coughing every second. Last night, 13Apr2021, he finally fell asleep at 3 am and woke up at 9am. They do not want to give him prednisone yet. He would have to wait 2 weeks after his last shot for it. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

A 59-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 for Covid-19 immunization on an unspecified date. He reported that on 27Mar2021 he got the 2nd COVID Pfizer shot and has increased on fatigue now and cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, also reported some abdominal swelling, none in legs. He reported weight gain but can la flat and no issues on resting conditions. He also reported dry cough since COVID shot but did not have any of such issues after the 1st dose. No fever, no dizziness or passing out. Diagnosis: Dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0) -Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 25-30. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis. His weight had increased from 217 lbs to 227 lbs - reported shob but no edema, they discussed increasing furosemide (LASIX) to 40/d from 20 daily for a week and reassess. Also suspect COVID vaccine related immune phenomenon. Treatment received for the events (Dilated cardiomyopathy, Left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac amyloidosis and weight gain). Events (has increased on fatigue, cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, abdominal swelling, weight gain and dry cough since COVID shot) onset date was on unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported cardiac amyloidosis, Dilated cardiomyopathy, and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations. More information on the patient&#39;s medical history, underlying medical conditions would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

CXR shows interstitial lung disease. Treated w/steroid, dose of convalescent plasma, supportive care, oxygen.   Brief History: Patient who presented with the above complaints.  Patient with a history of longstanding rheumatoid arthritis who presents to the ER with above-stated symptoms.  Patient reports history of chronic dry cough which she attributes to having lung disease related to rheumatoid arthritis.  Patient has received both doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, 2nd dose on April 8th.  About 2 weeks ago he started having low-grade fevers with worsening of cough and shortness of breath.

Symptoms worsened about a week ago with persistent fevers, increasing cough and shortness of breath.  Patient went to see his rheumatologist and diagnosed with interstitial lung disease this week and referred to see pulmonology.  He was monitoring his oxygen saturations at home which have been dropping down to 88-89% on room air that made him come to the ER.  Patient tested positive for COVID-19 in the emergency room.  CT angiogram of the chest showed no evidence of any pulmonary emboli but evidence of interstitial lung disease bilaterally.  He is currently being admitted for hypoxia secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.  Patient denies any chest pain   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted.  Kept on steroids and oxygen.  Seen by Infectious Disease.  Got a dose of convalescent plasma   This morning he is on room air.  Past the walk study.  Feeling lot better.

Found to be pancytopenic with bone marrow biopsy consistent with MDS.  He was started on chemo but stay was complicated by neutropenic fevers, epistaxis, retinal hemorrhage, AKI, fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and shock.  He ultimately had a heart attack while admitted and was transitioned to comfort care after medical interventions could not stabilize hemodynamics.

                                                Starting on the day of the vaccine (2nd dose)- I felt &#34;a warm, chemical and electrical sensation&#34; in my chest a few hours after the vaccine. The next morning, I was unable to have a bowel movement, when usually I am very regular.  I was not able to have a bowel movement for a couple of days.  I felt very constipated and would try to force myself to have a bowel movement.  I ate more fiber and fiber pills and drink more water, which was uneffective.  I  was finally able to have a bowel movement but it took a lot of force and would push the point of exhaustion and almost passing out. On 2/19/2021, I decided to seek medical care for my constipation, stomach cramps, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and shortness of breath. The doctor diagnosed me with Covid long hauler (I had a previous covid infection in 11/2020).  I was prescribe probotics (for constipation) and  rest for 2 months.  I am still feeling fatigue and having heart palpitations. They order ECG(normal) and blood work (normal).

A 59-years-old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 at 17:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patent medical history included asthma he hasn&#39;t had a bad asthma attack like this since he was 5yrs old and Nut allergy. Patient Concomitant medication included Trospium Chloride. After the First 1st dose on Friday (12Mar2021) and 5-6hours later at around 11:30pm he had a terrible asthma attack, he had difficulty breathing, it started out with a cough then wheezing that kept getting worse, he did not have an inhaler that was not at least 10yrs old. He was lying down, so he sat up and that helped him. he didn&#39;t&#39; want have the ambulance come over or take him to the hospital because it&#39;s too expensive and he don&#39;t have insurance. He thought he was having an anaphylactic reaction, like the caption drive ship in the storm. So, he sat up for 2 hours because I could not lie down could not breathe when he lies down. So, he sat up and pulled for breath and he had a terrible asthma attack, terrible wheeze, and coughing. If he would have started to get blotchy and swollen, then he probably would have call back the ambulance. He called the information for the number, hospital, they gave me the neurology department in the hospital for whatever reason he does not know. Then he called the police station and then googled phone number for the hospital that does not work anymore, and he could not call the hospital then he called the police station they tell him not to keep following. That is quite alright he had that Covid shot if he dies overnight then you can document what he told but he did not die overnight because he is feeling better, but the question is has not had an asthma attack like that since he was like 5 years old. The outcome is Unknown for all the events  Response: Unable to determine how someone will react to 1st or 2nd dose. Referred to HCP on recommendations for 2nd dose.

                                                Within a couple hours of the vaccine, in addition to expected arm soreness, I felt tingling up and down arm, then odd feeling throughout my body and head by the afternoon (just very odd, not pain).   I did not have any cold fever or flu-like symptoms.  But, within the next day or two, more concerning symptoms appeared:  I felt, for lack of a better way to describe it, very &#34;twitchy&#34; from my chest, like a flutter.   I&#39;ve felt restless and fatigued at the same time nearly all the time, like excess energy and exhaustion both at once.  I feel an uncomfortable feeling, like irregular heartbeat or arrhythmia in chest especially at night lying down, which as been interfering with sleep.  I have felt the restlessness and fatigue off and on night and day, interfering with focus and work.  This has gone on for over two months now since the first vaccine dose.  My overall health and how I felt were excellent the day prior to the vaccine.  There is definitely something off with my metabolism, in particular my cardiovascular and aerobic function, since the vaccine that has not yet resolved itself.  I can still exercise and feel better by doing so, but, it always feels at a lower performance level than before the vaccine.  The feeling in my chest, like a harder heartbeat than normal, and sometimes what fits some of the symptoms of congestive heart failure or possibly myocarditis, is most concerning.  I experience some periods where it feels like almost a wheezing in the back of my throat when I breathe.  This was persistent for awhile and now seems to be more off and on, becoming less often.  I am slender, exercise regularly and eat fairly healthy, am fit, and have never had any major health problems.  There definitely seems some kind of cardiovascular, aerobic and/or respiratory effect from the vaccine.

Those include: lip swelling, facial swelling, moderate difficulty breathing, anxiety, and severe diarrhea. Since it was late in the evening, I treated with an Albuterol inhaler, which provided very little relief. On 7/8/2021, I went to Urgent Care and was given a course of Prednisone, starting at 60mg and tapering down. Lip and facial swelling and diarrhea continued to be moderate to severe. On 7/9/2021, my breathing condition improved while still on 60mg of Prednisone. Facial and lip swelling continued. Additional diarrhea continued, but not as severe. On Sunday, 7/11/2021, as I reduced to 40mg of Prednisone, my condition deteriorated starting at 10:00am. Facial and lip swelling worsened, there was quite a bit of difficulty breathing and more diarrhea. However, I started to feel a lump in my throat as well. An on-call nurse asked me to take 25mg of Benadryl-- which I did. On 7/11/2021 at approximately 3:00pm, I went to the Emergency Room. O2 Sat levels ranged from 88 % to 95% and my BP was in the normal range. At 5:00pm, I was given additional Prednisone orally to increase that daily does to 60mg. I remain on a tapering dose today-- at 40mg and decending.
