A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

Concomitant medication included clopidogrel besylate (CLOPIDOGREL) for blood pressure; hydrochlorothiazide, losartan potassium (LOSARTAN &#43; HIDROCLOROTIAZIDA) as blood thinner and several of drugs. The patient had the Covid vaccine on the 12Jan2021 and yesterday (14Jan2021) as they noticed his eye, all around his eye was real swollen and puffy and in the corner, not on the eye but up on the eyelid it looks like, the reporter didn&#39;t know if it looks like a bruise or it&#39;s like a blood clot or something and it&#39;s still there, it hasn&#39;t gone away and they didn&#39;t know if this was from the vaccine, the reporter didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s bruise or if it&#39;s a clot the reporter didn&#39;t know, it&#39;s a red, dark red spot. after we had the vaccine they gave us a paper that had some information on it and it said on there they should advise them if on blood thinners, they did not told beforehand and the patient was on blood thinners. No treatment was received. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 86-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included two ongoing autoimmune diseases from unspecified dates and an ongoing pacemaker from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included ongoing blood thinners from an unspecified date. The patient experienced he can barely see/he cannot see/his vision is getting worse and worse and vision problems, both on unspecified dates. The patient&#39;s child called and stated that &#34;my father is on blood thinner. He has two autoimmune diseases and has a pacemaker. He developed visons problems within a few days after receiving the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19. Now he cannot take care of his dog. He will not be able to take care of himself. His vision has gotten progressively worse, he can barely see. I spoke to the specialist and other doctors, but they have no information. He will be seeing the doctor in 2 weeks only. I reported the side effects online. It was hard to get medical help because not many people are informed about what might go on with the vaccine. To get him diagnosed has been difficult. They can&#39;t do an MRI on him because he has a pacemaker. He is also 2 weeks out to see a specialist. In the meantime, he cannot see. His vision is getting worse and worse. His next vaccine is coming up too.&#34; The reporter had called and spoke with the director of immunization at the health department. She had also called and talked to VAERS as well. No one could point her to any help. The reporter believed this was probably related to the autoimmune diseases. The patient had no consultation not take the vaccine. The reporter had answered some information on the website while she had been waiting. The rest of the family also had autoimmune issues, and now they were all wondering if it was safe for them to take (the vaccine). The reporter wanted to know if we could provide any recommendations and if her father could get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical outcome of the event was not recovered.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

A contactable consumer reported that an 89-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Solution for injection) via unspecified route of administration on right arm at single dose on 23Jan2021, 14:00 (Saturday). The patient medical history included ongoing dementia (He has a little bit of dementia which has been ongoing since unknown date but at least 10 years) and Maybe some thyroid issues. The patient concomitant medication was not reported. On 27Jan2021, the patient slept most of the day/sleeping more than usual, caregiver tried to have him eat something, but he took one bite said it did not taste quite right and had a running fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. It was reported that patient usually wakes up around 9:00 to 9:30 and read his book but on 27Jan2021 he has been in his chair and slept most of the day, about 3-4 hours until around 14:00 to 14:30. The caregiver gave him some Tylenol and he was reading again with events ongoing and persistent. The reporter enquired whether these events were normal after vaccination because he would have had the symptoms onset closer to the date of vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken for fever. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.
