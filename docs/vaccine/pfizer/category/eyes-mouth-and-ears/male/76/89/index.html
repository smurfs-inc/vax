                                                Approximately 8 hours after shot I suddenly had  dizzy feeling, my eyes became crossed, could not focus my eyes, everything was a blur.  I could think correct and carry on a conversation.  Took 2 Ibuprofen, drank 8oz of water and laid down for a half hour or so.  After about 40 minutes my eyes started coming back in focus.  My left eye was not seeing some cobweb stands but eventually stopped and became normal.  I then ate some food and everything seemed to be ok.  As I write this 5 hours after the above incident nothing more has happened.  My arm does not hurt either.  No other symptoms of any kind are occurring.

This double vision was intermittent, lasting for several hours at one time.   This double vision persisted and worsened with double vision all day long.  At the ER prior to discharge, Dr. diagnosed me with possible  &#34;Ocular myasthenia gravis&#34; and prescribed me with Pyridostigmine Bromide.  After having been 30mg of this medicine daily for 1 week, the double vision has not subsided.  Starting today (2/24), I am beginning to take 60mg daily.  This double vision continues today (2/24/2021) even with the newly prescribed medication

Did not feel refreshed as I normally do when I wake up in the morning. As the day went on sparkles and vision issues remained and headache got worse. Went to bed earlier than normal and next day when woke up the symptoms got worse, I felt like I had a migraine. Vision issues persisted. Laid down around 11AM and took a nap and when I woke up I noticed a blotch in my left eye reminiscent of the shape of a fish (looked like a shark) and it had different colors. Bright yellow and black almost kind of an iridescent green and orange. The shape was still just the colors were different.  I panicked and called the optometrist and explained what happened. They wanted to see me right away. I was able to be seen in the afternoon. They looked at it, did two tests and came with the diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion.  I visited my neuro- ophthalmologist on 01/28 and he confirmed the diagnosis had previously given.  He then ordered fedrate and a couple of other tests. They also did a visual acuity in the left eye (20/30) and color vision (8/8 normal) and color plates and intraocular pressure (16 OS)

                                                Awakening  on Saturday, March 13, I saw blood on my pillow and a pee spot on the bed (my first time for either).  I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

He was able to get some benadryl around noon and took that then took more when he returned home.  The swelling went down as he continued the benadryl for several days every 4 hours during the day and then before bed.   It has now been almost a week (Feb. 1, Monday) and the lip is still a little swollen and is tender and sore.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EM9809/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration, on 04-FEB-2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78 years old) 0.3mL as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included patient was diabetic since an unknown date and has psoriatic arthritis. Concomitant medication included infliximab (REMICADE) infusion every 8 weeks for psoriatic arthritis and cetirizine hydrochloride (EQUATE ALLERGY RELIEF). The patient had infliximab infusion the morning of 04Feb2021, prior to receiving the vaccination and was told that infliximab would not be a problem with receiving the vaccination on the same day. On 07Feb2021, the patient went to the emergency room due to Bell&#39;s palsy, which was described as swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face and stated that he can&#39;t talk very good because his lips are swelled up/hard to talk and his eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking. The patient stated, &#34;I went to the emergency room at a hospital and what they said is totally unrelated to the COVID shot I got. In the meantime, few days after I had the shot, I had somehow got Bell&#39;s palsy caused the side of my face to swell up and droop on one side. I just wanted to get back to you so you knew that was not some reaction to the COVID shot, it was something else.&#34; Treatment for the event Bell&#39;s palsy included took Allergy Relief Equate 25mg ultra tablet and another allergy pill and it did not help swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face. Relevant tests included blood work on an unspecified date in 2021 &#34;two weeks ago&#34; that was all good. The outcome of the events Bell&#39;s palsy, eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking and hard to talk was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                He received his vaccine, and immediately he could taste it in his mouth.  About 5-6 days later his normal routine was to work outside and noticed that he had lost his energy issue, and had this issue in the past when his pacemaker was out of wack.  As the month went on it got worse and worse.  In March he was out cleaning up the yard and as he worked it got worse and worse.  He would have to work for 5 and sit down for a minute.  He has hyperventilation syndrome and diagnosed back in 1980 and has been under control, this is one thing that always happens, which seems to be an ongoing problem that he&#39;s having.  His settings on his pacemaker seem to be OK.  He was sitting on his couch and watching a race on 3/8/21 and got a shock coming up from the bottom part of his head, through his chest and out through his right eye, this was less than 2 seconds.  This was an event, but not a hard &#34;mule&#34; kick event.  He wasn&#39;t doing anything to get the shock.  The defibrillator is connected to the bottom part of his heart.  He has a logic system and had an episode of 190-200 BPM which was at the top part of his heart.  He had all of his equipment checked out yesterday, but they could not give him an answer why he got a shock.  He now has to set up an appointment with his cardiologist to see tomorrow.   He has had the pacemaker for 6-7 years now and the device goes into the device clinic and he gets reports regarding this information.   They device people said there was no registration that he had any event.

By 3/1, I also had thigh and buttock ache with effort and left TMJ pain. On 3/2, I saw Dr. My sed rate was 24. She made a diagnosis of probable PMR and prescribed prednisone. After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

I was not able to go back to sleep.  I realized it was Tendinitis, as I have had systems of Tendinitis, over the years, but it just came and went, and was not loud enough or lasted long enough to be anything but a minor annoyance .   In this case while it is not loud, it is loud enough to be annoying, and it still did not go away. (time is now -01:13 PM 2/16, I am hoping it is just the vaccine working its way through my system.   I notified my primary care doctor at the VA, as well as audio dept.

A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine at on Monday, February 15. That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

                                                Lost hearing in left ear; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 81-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6199), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 11Mar2021 11:00 (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Batch/lot number: EL1283) in left arm on 18Feb2021 (at the age of 81-years-old) for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetes (had that for years; has always been the same; His last test was 6.7 which was pretty good); 2 stents in leg (at least 5 years ago; takes a blood thinner (ongoing)); partial knee replacement (a couple years ago, that came out fine) and shots (when he was in the military, he got all the shots and had no problem). Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) as blood thinner from an unspecified start date and ongoing and just takes his normal medications that the doctors prescribe. He has been taking them for quite a few years so he didn&#39;t think they have anything to do with it. He never knows, it could be a mixture. But no, he didn&#39;t think any medications he takes were relevant. The patient previously took only one flu shot last Sep2020. No events following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced lost hearing in left ear on 26Mar2021 at 07:00, he woke up and that was it, he had no hearing, it was complete hearing loss. Then he thought maybe it would come back during the day. He heard something and picked his head off of the pillow. His partner was talking, but his right ear was buried in the pillow. When he raised it he could hear her talk. That&#39;s when he noticed. The next day he went to same day care and they put him on an antibiotic. He took 2 of the antibiotic the first day and then 1 each day. He didn&#39;t know if he has it. He did not have information for the antibiotic or remember the name of it. The event did not require emergency room visit but a visit to the physician&#39;s office. went to the same day clinic on 27Mar2021, the day after his hearing loss. He had thought maybe it might come back. The antibiotic didn&#39;t work, so he went to his primary doctor on 01Apr2021 and made an appointment with an ENT on 07Apr2021. On 07Apr2021 the hearing test with result of the bottom was completely dead on his left ear, everything else was dead. His right ear was great for his age. What they did was put a needle in his ear drum and shot it with a steroid. They said a couple of treatments sometimes brings back the hearing and sometimes doesn&#39;t. They called it sudden hearing loss. He could hear out of his right ear okay. He had good hearing before and had no problems. The patient wanted to know if there had been any problems with loss of hearing after the Covid vaccine. He wished that he would have some improvement. There was no one in his family that lost their hearing, so he would say probably not. No one in his family has any problems or lost hearing or anything. He didn&#39;t know of any other problem that would be significant. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

His vision has gotten progressively worse, he can barely see. I spoke to the specialist and other doctors, but they have no information. He will be seeing the doctor in 2 weeks only. I reported the side effects online. It was hard to get medical help because not many people are informed about what might go on with the vaccine. To get him diagnosed has been difficult. They can&#39;t do an MRI on him because he has a pacemaker. He is also 2 weeks out to see a specialist. In the meantime, he cannot see. His vision is getting worse and worse. His next vaccine is coming up too.&#34; The reporter had called and spoke with the director of immunization at the health department. She had also called and talked to VAERS as well. No one could point her to any help. The reporter believed this was probably related to the autoimmune diseases. The patient had no consultation not take the vaccine. The reporter had answered some information on the website while she had been waiting. The rest of the family also had autoimmune issues, and now they were all wondering if it was safe for them to take (the vaccine). The reporter wanted to know if we could provide any recommendations and if her father could get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical outcome of the event was not recovered.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

An 87-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 in left upper arm shoulder area at single dose for  vaccination; glimepiride (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2 mg, 1x/day (once per day in the morning) for diabetes; vitamin d (manufacturer unknown, lot# 300015, expiration date:  Jan2022), via an unspecified route of administration from 2019 and ongoing at 3000 iU, daily (2000 IUs in the morning and 1000 IUs nightly) for bone and immune health; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, lot# P139558, expiration date:  Aug2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 81 mg, 1x/day for helping thin his blood; apixaban (ELIQUIS, 2.5 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from 2018 and ongoing at 2.5 mg, 2x/day (morning and night) for blood thinner; simvastatin (ZOCOR, 20 mg), orally from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, 1x/day for cholesterol; metoprolol (manufacturer unknown, 50 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg, daily (1/2 tablet once daily (25mg total daily dose)) for an unspecified indication; celecoxib (CELEXA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (1-20 mg tablet once daily) for clinical depression; vitamin c (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205348, expiration date: Jun2023), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 1 DF, daily for supplement to boost immunity; famotidine (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at unknown dose with 2x/day (1-40mg tablet twice daily) for nauseated; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12, 2500 mg, lot# 511333-01, expiration date: Jun2023),  via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2500 mg, 1x/day for supplement; magnesium (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205340, expiration date:  Jun2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (400 mg mostly every day but not strictly every day) to keep himself going; immuneti (manufacturer unknown, Capsule, NDC: 2817636726), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 capsule taken daily  for an unspecified indication. Medical history included bad hearing problem. This consumer called on behalf of her husband to ask about possible side effects he was having. She reported that these possible side effects could be from Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications: glimepiride; Vitamin D; acetylsalicylic acid; apixaban; simvastatin; metoprolol; celecoxib; Vitamin C; famotidine; Vitamin B12; magnesium; and Immuneti. She was concerned about the possible side effects and wanted to ask Pfizer if these possible side effects could be from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications. Caller&#39;s husband was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Caller also got her Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Neither patient or caller had any problems with the product initially. Then her husband had onset of possible side effects last night. Starting 17Jan2021 after patient took his usual night medications, which caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included, patient began to feel real bad. He said he smelled some kind of chemical and caller said she did not smell anything. Patient got to feeling worse and worse and they stayed up fairly late to see if he got to feeling better. When he got up this morning: 18Jan2021, he was feeling some better. He came in the room and when he put his medications in his mouth, before he even got them swallowed, he began to feel bad again-caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included. Patient had been on simvastatin a long time and one time they took him off of this and started it back; he had been back on this for about 1 year. Metoprolol was discarded after 10th and 9th of 2021, documented as provided by reporter. Patient started it maybe 2-3 years ago. Vitamin C was Over the counter product, start date was probably 6-8 months ago. Vitamin B12 was probably started about 6-8 months ago. Magnesium was Over the counter product and probably started about 6-8 months ago. Caller verified that there are no other relevant products/medical conditions to provide for this report. She mentioned separately that patient had a bad hearing problem so caller handled his calls for him. The action taken in response to the events for all drugs (except for bnt162b2) was dose not changed. Outcome of events were unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.

Same problem the morning after sleep and over the next day.  Went to opthamalogist on Monday, Feb 1 who immediately referred to retina specialist, seen Feb 2.  Have ongoing treatment for glaucoma, has been stable for years.  I am not claiming this started because of the shot, but it was so close after that I thought I should report out of an excess of caution.

                                                has a fever of 102; Caregiver tried to have him eat something but he took one bite said it did not taste quite right; slept most of the day/sleeping more than usual; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer Program. A contactable consumer reported that an 89-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Solution for injection) via unspecified route of administration on right arm at single dose on 23Jan2021, 14:00 (Saturday). The patient medical history included ongoing dementia (He has a little bit of dementia which has been ongoing since unknown date but at least 10 years) and Maybe some thyroid issues. The patient concomitant medication was not reported. On 27Jan2021, the patient slept most of the day/sleeping more than usual, caregiver tried to have him eat something, but he took one bite said it did not taste quite right and had a running fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. It was reported that patient usually wakes up around 9:00 to 9:30 and read his book but on 27Jan2021 he has been in his chair and slept most of the day, about 3-4 hours until around 14:00 to 14:30. The caregiver gave him some Tylenol and he was reading again with events ongoing and persistent. The reporter enquired whether these events were normal after vaccination because he would have had the symptoms onset closer to the date of vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken for fever. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.
