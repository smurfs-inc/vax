After that had 1 hour of uncontolled severe shaking and shivering . Next day felt fine.  Afew days started noticing LOW FREQUENCY INTERMITTANT TINNITUS THAT IS A HUM, BUT ONLY IF I AM AROUND HIGH VOLTAGE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES AND POWER TRANSFORMERS .  HEAR IT IN MY HOME  WHICH IS 1000 FEET FROM HIGH VOLTAGE LINES 24/7 SINCE DAY 2-4 OF DOSE #1.  Can hear it in other enclosed areas, but doesn&#39;t seem to happen AS MUCH outdoors, although if I am within 1000 feet of high voltage lines I will hear it UNLESS  there are many trees to block the EMF&#39;s or HUM between me and the source.  SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IS TRUE  FOR PAST 3 MONTHS 24/7 AND HAS RUINED MY LIFE BECAUSE I CANNOT SLEEP AND SLEEPING PILLS DON&#39;T WORK.   HAS DISRUPTED MY SLEEP CENTER SOMEHOW.  ALL OF THIS IS SINCE FIRST COIVD19 SHOT !  HAVE HAD #2 SHOT AND WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER !

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 25 Feb 2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at clinic. Medical history included hypertension, blood cholesterol increased, myocardial infarction, colon cancer (had surgery for that and also had chemotherapy), coronary artery disease (30% blocked coronary artery), covid-19 from 19May2020 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril for hypertension; amlodipine; rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol increased; evolocumab (REPATHA), subcutaneously at 140 mg (twice a month) for blood cholesterol increased. The patient reported, he was diagnosed positive with COVID-19 on 27May2020 from which he seem to have recovered without any residues of symptoms or side effect. He received first Pfizer COVID vaccination at noon time this past Thursday 25Feb in a vaccination clinic set up, the following day Friday the 26 he woke up the next morning and entire body was so sore from head to toe and could hardly get himself out of bed, but when he got up, he was having difficulty walking, so anyway he stayed in bed all day on 26 and 27. He initially had a slight temperature, some chills, slight cough, runny nose and those symptoms except for the cough seem to have resolved, what hasn&#39;t resolved is about every 30 or 40 minutes or so he had been having to urinate ever since 26Feb2021 night, his mouth has been constantly very dry. Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 76-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 10:30 as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events prior vaccination. There was no family history relevant to adverse events. The patient previously received first dose was received in his left shoulder as an injection on 25Feb2021 10:30 and the lot number is EN6200. On 19Mar2021, the patient experienced terrible muscle pain and joint pain, little shaky when getting out of the chair, on unspecified date in Apr2021, experienced jawbone like what hooks onto his head gets achy, it gets achy and is weird and on unspecified date in 2021, experienced his hands joint do not work right.. It was stated that he was calling to report what has happened to him from the second shot. The patient stated he got the shot on 18Mar2021 and when he woke up in the next morning he had terrible muscle pain and joint pain so he decided to call his doctor.

It was stated that before he got the COVID shot he was working out with weights in the fitness center and doing really good and now he was fighting a battle. The patient stated also his jawbone like what hooks onto his head gets achy. The patient stated that mostly the joint pain was in his shoulders. It was stated he was sitting down on his chair and he used to be able to get up real easy but he now he was a little shaky when getting out of the chair now. The patient stated also his hands joint do not work right but he bought some stuff to rub on them which seems to help a little bit, but he has never had any of this before. It was stated he was working out, handling barbells, and for an old guy people would be surprised what he was lifting and he had no problems and stated for example if he goes to eat a breakfast meal with the egg, sausage, and biscuit he can barely open his mouth enough to eat it. The patient stated this started probably at the end of April. It was stated this is no 24 hours a day but he had it this morning and it gets achy and was weird. It was stated that eventually he will go back to the dentist since the dentist has a machine to take a picture of his jaw since he has not gone yet because of COVID but once he gets all this squared away he will go to dentist so they can take that picture. It was stated he was able to squat down towards the floor and go way down all the way down and pop right up and stated he knows he could not do that in the last couple of weeks anyway but he has not tried it since he has had trouble getting out of chair. It was clarified that this started as an introduction the day after getting the second shot on 19Mar2021 and it was still going on. It was stated he was not sure if it is getting worse or not since he has not followed it like a documentary. It was stated the doctor told him to take Tylenol and he has never had anything like this happen to him. It was stated what the doctor relayed to him was to go get a Tylenol rapid release and he takes two pills which is 1,000mg and he takes this 3 times a day and has a schedule knowing it was not recommended to take more than the 3,000 since the doctor was not wanting him to go over 4,000mg because effect the kidneys or liver. It was stated but he had not talked face to face with his doctor and he needs to get an appointment with his doctor but there is a wait and probably won&#39;t be able to see him for about a month. The outcome of the events terrible muscle pain and joint pain, jawbone like what hooks onto his head gets achy were not recovered and rest of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after shot I suddenly had  dizzy feeling, my eyes became crossed, could not focus my eyes, everything was a blur.  I could think correct and carry on a conversation.  Took 2 Ibuprofen, drank 8oz of water and laid down for a half hour or so.  After about 40 minutes my eyes started coming back in focus.  My left eye was not seeing some cobweb stands but eventually stopped and became normal.  I then ate some food and everything seemed to be ok.  As I write this 5 hours after the above incident nothing more has happened.  My arm does not hurt either.  No other symptoms of any kind are occurring.

This double vision was intermittent, lasting for several hours at one time.   This double vision persisted and worsened with double vision all day long.  At the ER prior to discharge, Dr. diagnosed me with possible  &#34;Ocular myasthenia gravis&#34; and prescribed me with Pyridostigmine Bromide.  After having been 30mg of this medicine daily for 1 week, the double vision has not subsided.  Starting today (2/24), I am beginning to take 60mg daily.  This double vision continues today (2/24/2021) even with the newly prescribed medication

                                                Awakening  on Saturday, March 13, I saw blood on my pillow and a pee spot on the bed (my first time for either).  I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

                                                Almost immediately felt swelling at the injection site, which I felt as being normal.  Next day when I woke up felt a slight headache , abnormal vision issues that included sparkles, blurred vision and a general tiredness. Did not feel refreshed as I normally do when I wake up in the morning. As the day went on sparkles and vision issues remained and headache got worse. Went to bed earlier than normal and next day when woke up the symptoms got worse, I felt like I had a migraine. Vision issues persisted. Laid down around 11AM and took a nap and when I woke up I noticed a blotch in my left eye reminiscent of the shape of a fish (looked like a shark) and it had different colors. Bright yellow and black almost kind of an iridescent green and orange. The shape was still just the colors were different.  I panicked and called the optometrist and explained what happened. They wanted to see me right away. I was able to be seen in the afternoon. They looked at it, did two tests and came with the diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion.  I visited my neuro- ophthalmologist on 01/28 and he confirmed the diagnosis had previously given.  He then ordered fedrate and a couple of other tests. They also did a visual acuity in the left eye (20/30) and color vision (8/8 normal) and color plates and intraocular pressure (16 OS)

I was seen by Dr. who checked it and said it was bigger than last time and closer to the central retinal artery.

                                                tinnitus, which I have had for 20 years,  was worsened.  Today (3 days after shot) seems better.    Purchased ear buds day after shot to mask extra tinnitus noise for sleep.  Part of the associated ear bud app has a hearing test. (Who knew?)   Anyway, this hearing test showed hearing loss for maybe 40% of their test  I told primary care doc about it and she said should see ENT doc asap.   Have not noticed any hearing loss, just &#34;failed&#34; the test . Appt with ENT is 3 days away.  On prednisone in the interim per the rec of pcp.

He was able to get some benadryl around noon and took that then took more when he returned home.  The swelling went down as he continued the benadryl for several days every 4 hours during the day and then before bed.   It has now been almost a week (Feb. 1, Monday) and the lip is still a little swollen and is tender and sore.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EM9809/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration, on 04-FEB-2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78 years old) 0.3mL as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included patient was diabetic since an unknown date and has psoriatic arthritis. Concomitant medication included infliximab (REMICADE) infusion every 8 weeks for psoriatic arthritis and cetirizine hydrochloride (EQUATE ALLERGY RELIEF). The patient had infliximab infusion the morning of 04Feb2021, prior to receiving the vaccination and was told that infliximab would not be a problem with receiving the vaccination on the same day. On 07Feb2021, the patient went to the emergency room due to Bell&#39;s palsy, which was described as swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face and stated that he can&#39;t talk very good because his lips are swelled up/hard to talk and his eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking. The patient stated, &#34;I went to the emergency room at a hospital and what they said is totally unrelated to the COVID shot I got. In the meantime, few days after I had the shot, I had somehow got Bell&#39;s palsy caused the side of my face to swell up and droop on one side. I just wanted to get back to you so you knew that was not some reaction to the COVID shot, it was something else.&#34; Treatment for the event Bell&#39;s palsy included took Allergy Relief Equate 25mg ultra tablet and another allergy pill and it did not help swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face. Relevant tests included blood work on an unspecified date in 2021 &#34;two weeks ago&#34; that was all good. The outcome of the events Bell&#39;s palsy, eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking and hard to talk was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                He received his vaccine, and immediately he could taste it in his mouth.  About 5-6 days later his normal routine was to work outside and noticed that he had lost his energy issue, and had this issue in the past when his pacemaker was out of wack.  As the month went on it got worse and worse.  In March he was out cleaning up the yard and as he worked it got worse and worse.  He would have to work for 5 and sit down for a minute.  He has hyperventilation syndrome and diagnosed back in 1980 and has been under control, this is one thing that always happens, which seems to be an ongoing problem that he&#39;s having.  His settings on his pacemaker seem to be OK.  He was sitting on his couch and watching a race on 3/8/21 and got a shock coming up from the bottom part of his head, through his chest and out through his right eye, this was less than 2 seconds.  This was an event, but not a hard &#34;mule&#34; kick event.  He wasn&#39;t doing anything to get the shock.  The defibrillator is connected to the bottom part of his heart.  He has a logic system and had an episode of 190-200 BPM which was at the top part of his heart.  He had all of his equipment checked out yesterday, but they could not give him an answer why he got a shock.  He now has to set up an appointment with his cardiologist to see tomorrow.   He has had the pacemaker for 6-7 years now and the device goes into the device clinic and he gets reports regarding this information.   They device people said there was no registration that he had any event.

A 79-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL3248), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Jan2021 11:00 (at 79-years age) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes and hypertension (he was diabetic and was on blood pressure medication, but both his hypertension was under control, and his diabetes, sure his A1C is higher than it should be but was under control with oral medication), root canal infection (though this was contributed to the root canal which he had on 29Jan2021, the root canal was on the lower left of the mouth, tooth number 20). Patient provided relevant Family medical History of Hypertension. Concomitant Medications: He was just taking his general medications, like his maintenance medication, nothing out of the normal. He had no other vaccines on the same day as the covid vaccine or in the 4 weeks prior. He had no positive covid or antibody test prior to the first dose (he had never had a test).On 08Feb2021, the patient had the 1st occurrence of swelling was like golf ball size, it was visible, but it went away after 3-4 hours and he didn&#39;t have to take anything. Then on the 11Feb2021, the patient woke up at 4:30AM, experienced the swelling and it felt numb, the numb feeling starting on left side of cheek and wound up settling in upper lip, it gave him a distorted appearance, it was severe. The swelling in the mouth, that wound up settling in upper lip which was the 2nd occurrence in a 3-day period. The first occurrence was swelling, not as severe, in the lower inside of the mouth in the lower right inside of the gum, the swelling appearance from the outside, though this was contributed to the root canal (had on 29Jan2021). The swelling in the mouth from 08Feb2021 subsided for him in 3-4 hours. He called endodontist, and told her about the second swelling, she said to come in and look at it, that was on 11Feb2021, she took X-rays and result was normal, she said it was not connected to the root canal and told him to contact his Primary and go from there, he agreed with her because he did not feel any type of sensitivity. On 11Feb2021, patient then called the Primary Care doctor, told how he developed the swelling, and the primary care said that he would rather see an ENT specialist and he got an appointment with the ENT that same day 11Feb2021 at 15:00 in the afternoon. The patient went to see him, the ENT checked his mouth out, checked his nose and throat, he did not know what it was stemming from, and said he will put him on an antibiotic. On 11Feb2021, the ENT said that the patient did had a swollen gland he noticed on the left side. The swelling in the mouth on the 11Feb2021 on his lip lasted about 2 days, his upper lip irritated on inside for a day or 2, but it lasted till about the 13Feb2021. On 11Feb2021 (5 days ago), the patient was put on an antibiotic for swelling that occurred in his mouth which was Clindamycin HCL 300mg, 3 pills a day with his last 2 pills of antibiotics falls same day (18Feb2021) as his second vaccine dose was scheduled on Thursday (18Feb2021; appeared to be scheduled outside of the 21-day recommendation). Patient felt like he was sort of on edge for another occurrence possibly happening. Being on the antibiotic, maybe this was some type of infection. The ENT told honestly that he didn&#39;t know why this happened, but if it happened again, he might have a CT scan for the suspect salivary gland, maybe it was clogged or there was an infection in the gland. He asked if he should take the pills or reschedule the vaccine dose and if it was ok to receive the second shot while on this antibiotic (his prescribing doctor couldn&#39;t give an answer). On 18Feb2021, the patient was due to have booster. Patient would have 2 pills left on the 18Feb2021, after that he was finished. Therapeutic measures of antibiotic were taken as a result of swelling that occurred in his mouth (mouth swelling). He did not have to go to the emergency room for the mouth swelling but he has visited the physician&#39;s office. The outcome for swelling in the mouth and lips was recovered on 13Feb2021 (Duration 5 Day); outcome for swollen gland was unknown.  Follow up (16Feb2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported patient information, new event information.

After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

I was not able to go back to sleep.  I realized it was Tendinitis, as I have had systems of Tendinitis, over the years, but it just came and went, and was not loud enough or lasted long enough to be anything but a minor annoyance .   In this case while it is not loud, it is loud enough to be annoying, and it still did not go away. (time is now -01:13 PM 2/16, I am hoping it is just the vaccine working its way through my system.   I notified my primary care doctor at the VA, as well as audio dept.

A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine at on Monday, February 15. That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 81-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 81-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.Medical history included Transverse Myelitis which is a virus of the spinal cord (from age of 11 yr), wheelchair user, difficulty walking (from the transverse myelitis). Reporter and her husband both received the first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 02Feb2021.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On11Feb2021, patient experienced dry heaves, pain and bloating in his stomach, his extremities felt cold and he was shivering, had night sweats and wasn&#39;t eating or drinking. He has been feeling progressively worse since Feb 11th, but she stated she has been taking his temperature and he did not had a fever but had been very thirsty. He had not been able to walk the last couple of days and had to use his wheelchair. Last night on 10Feb2021, he probably drank gallons of water due to his excessive thirst. His doctor told him to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which he did, but it didn&#39;t help. His symptoms have progressed such that the reporter dropped her husband off at the ER today. Reporter stated that he now did have a fever and is awaiting results of a chest x-ray and lab work (performed on 16Feb2021). He was having difficulty breathing, but his oxygen levels were normal. Reporter read online about two people in (city) developed transverse myelitis after receiving a Covid vaccine, but she was not sure which vaccine they received. She was calling to report this information to Pfizer and to see if these types of reactions have been reported and at 10 days post initial vaccination. The patient Is currently in the emergency Room and has not been able to eat for 5 days. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 81-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6199), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 11Mar2021 11:00 (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Batch/lot number: EL1283) in left arm on 18Feb2021 (at the age of 81-years-old) for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetes (had that for years; has always been the same; His last test was 6.7 which was pretty good); 2 stents in leg (at least 5 years ago; takes a blood thinner (ongoing)); partial knee replacement (a couple years ago, that came out fine) and shots (when he was in the military, he got all the shots and had no problem). Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) as blood thinner from an unspecified start date and ongoing and just takes his normal medications that the doctors prescribe. He has been taking them for quite a few years so he didn&#39;t think they have anything to do with it. He never knows, it could be a mixture. But no, he didn&#39;t think any medications he takes were relevant. The patient previously took only one flu shot last Sep2020. No events following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced lost hearing in left ear on 26Mar2021 at 07:00, he woke up and that was it, he had no hearing, it was complete hearing loss. Then he thought maybe it would come back during the day. He heard something and picked his head off of the pillow. His partner was talking, but his right ear was buried in the pillow. When he raised it he could hear her talk. That&#39;s when he noticed. The next day he went to same day care and they put him on an antibiotic. He took 2 of the antibiotic the first day and then 1 each day. He didn&#39;t know if he has it. He did not have information for the antibiotic or remember the name of it. The event did not require emergency room visit but a visit to the physician&#39;s office. went to the same day clinic on 27Mar2021, the day after his hearing loss. He had thought maybe it might come back. The antibiotic didn&#39;t work, so he went to his primary doctor on 01Apr2021 and made an appointment with an ENT on 07Apr2021. On 07Apr2021 the hearing test with result of the bottom was completely dead on his left ear, everything else was dead. His right ear was great for his age. What they did was put a needle in his ear drum and shot it with a steroid. They said a couple of treatments sometimes brings back the hearing and sometimes doesn&#39;t. They called it sudden hearing loss. He could hear out of his right ear okay. He had good hearing before and had no problems. The patient wanted to know if there had been any problems with loss of hearing after the Covid vaccine. He wished that he would have some improvement. There was no one in his family that lost their hearing, so he would say probably not. No one in his family has any problems or lost hearing or anything. He didn&#39;t know of any other problem that would be significant. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

An 84-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EW0164) via an unspecified route of administration on an 15Apr2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing prostate problems from an unspecified date (for probably 15 years), ongoing high blood pressure from an unspecified date (diagnosed with high blood pressure 12-15 years ago), ongoing high cholesterol from an unspecified date (he cannot remember when he was diagnosed with high cholesterol. His cholesterol has been great, since he had been taking cholesterol medications, he has had normal cholesterol. He thought his total cholesterol last time was 170 and that his triglycerides were low), blood pressure from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, heartburn from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing and eye problems from an unspecified date and ongoing. The patient did not have a history of adverse events following prior vaccinations. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event was reported as the patient&#39;s sister had eye problems. She had to get an injection in her eye every couple of weeks or once a month or something. He did not know if his sister had macular degeneration or what. Other than wearing eye glasses, that was the only family history that he could think of that might be relevant. Concomitant mediations included morniflumate (FLOMAX; capsule) taken for prostate from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF 2x/day (8-10 years ago, started with 1 capsule daily but now took 1 capsule twice daily; the patient reported that at his last report, his PSA was up to 9 and it was now down to 3.1); finasteride (PROSCAR) taken for prostate from an unspecified date and ongoing; hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril (LISINOPRIL &#43; HIDROCLOROTIAZIDA) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date and ongoing (for quite a long time); omeprazole (PRILOSEC) taken for heartburn from an unspecified date and ongoing, as needed (if the patient knew that he was going to have something spicy or tomato based for dinner, he knew he would get heartburn, so he would take a Prilosec in the morning. He had used Prilosec for years off and on, since he was working as a pharmacist and he retired in 2013) and atorvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing (for about a year; he was changed from Zocor because the medication did not get along with his blood pressure sometimes). The patient previously received zocor on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced did not get along with his blood pressure sometimes. The patient did not receive additional vaccines on the same date or within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received the flu (INFLUENZA VACCINE), pneumonia (PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE) and shingles (VARICELLA ZOSTER VACCINE) vaccines all at the end of 2020 (at the age of 84-years-old) for immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EB8730) via an unspecified route of administration on an 25Mar2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. In Apr2021 the patient experienced vision changes in right eye/vision complications/getting a dark spot in the bottom part of the vision of his right eye, loss of his peripheral vision, the peripheral vision in his right eye was getting cloudy/eyes go in and out of focus while reading and his vision was getting a little worse. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient was a retired pharmacist who called to find out whether there had been any reports of vision complications after the COVID-19 vaccine. He received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 15Apr2021 and as of about 2 weeks ago, the peripheral vision in his right eye was getting cloudy and the patient was getting a dark spot in the bottom part of the vision of his right eye. He did not know if Pfizer had any types of reports on that type of side effect. He made an appointment with his eye doctor for tomorrow, 04May2021. He wanted to have any information that Pfizer might have. He knew that his eye doctor was going to ask him questions to try to determine what was causing the vision changes. He wanted to check with Pfizer before he went to the eye doctor so that he had an answer to the doctor&#39;s questions. The patient reported that his vision was getting a little worse. He was now having a little trouble with the computer. He had to refocus every time he moved his eyes. Yesterday, 02May2021, he had what could have been a problem driving. He was driving on the highway and there was a lighted sign. He could not read the sign because it was on the right side of the road. By the time he could focus on the sign, he could not read it because he was right by the sign. Something like that could be a big problem. He reported that his eyes go in and out of focus while reading. He had to re-focus when he was going to the next line of text that he was reading. He just got an eye exam and new glasses in Feb2021. His problem in Feb2021 was with focus. He was having problems more or less with reading. In the bright light, everything was fine, but that in regular kitchen or incandescent light, he would only be able to read a paragraph or so. He would then have to refocus in order to read more. It became a real problem and the new glasses that he got were not solving it. The patient stated that the last Pfizer representative he spoke with said that Pfizer did not have any vision changes listed as a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine that the representative knew of. The Pfizer representative informed the caller that there may have been calls that have come in reporting vision changes, but vision changes were not listed as a side effect yet. The patient stated that he saw about 5 doctors. His primary care physician did not know about the vision changes as the changes had just occurred in the last 2 weeks. The patient had absolutely no reaction to either dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He did not even have a sore arm following the COVID-19 vaccine injections. The vision changes started about 2 weeks ago and he wanted to wait to see if it was going to clear up before he made appointments with his physicians. He reported that his vision did not clear up and that he was now getting concerned, especially with driving. The adverse events required a visit to the physician office. The clinical outcomes of the events vision changes in right eye/vision complications/getting a dark spot in the bottom part of the vision of his right eye, loss of his peripheral vision, the peripheral vision in his right eye was getting cloudy/eyes go in and out of focus while reading and his vision was getting a little worse were not recovered/not resolved. The patient reported that he did not believe (doubted that) that the COVID-19 vaccine caused his vision changes.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available the changes in vision in this 84-year old patient is attributed to  patient&#39;s advanced age and assessed unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).

An 84-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 21Jun2021) (at the age of 84 years old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma (Very occasionally), sleep apnoea from Apr2020 (use Cpap, use a breathing machine), arthritis, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypothyroidism. Patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 06Feb2021 01:15 pm (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) (at the age of 84 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. Concomitant medications included ramipril taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported; metoprolol taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported; tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX RELIEF) taken for benign prostatic hyperplasia, start and stop date were not reported; pregabalin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism, start and stop date were not reported; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ezetimibe (ZETIA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d nos taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma, start and stop date were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient developed a taste in mouth that was a cross between ink and metallic, mostly ink, that has persisted till the present time on 23Feb2021 01:45 AM (as reported). Physician stated, he received 2 Pfizer inoculations, one on February 6th and second on February 23rd. Within about 20-25 minutes of the time, in the second shot, he developed a taste in mouth that was a cross between ink and metallic, mostly ink, if you have ever touched your lips when you had, the regular ink that you drew up into a fountain pen and that has persisted till the present time. Physician stated, it tasted and thus tasted as ink. If he drinks plain drinking water, it taste like drinking ink. Physician stated, it came on within 20 minutes-25 minutes of the time that he received the vaccine. At first he thought it was the hand sanitizer in mouth but it never went away, so it may be a coincidence, it came on 20-25 minutes after and it never went away. His lab work was normal, all of it. He had a CBC, a complete chemistry, had a Fabre and a CRT, had a lipid exam and they were all absolutely normal, all on 26Feb2021 (as reported). No treatment was received for the event. The outcome of event metallic/ink taste was not recovered while for other event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

On exam, he has no cranial nerve deficits but has a patch of subjective numbness  involving the above area. Tongue is not involved. Entire dermatome of the  Mandibular branch of the L Trigeminal nerve does NOT appear to be involved.   There is no swelling. There is no pain currently.   Need to assume that this is a vaccine reaction.

An 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EM9810, expiration date was not reported) (at 86 years of age), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 03Feb2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, ongoing blood pressure abnormal and ongoing thyroid disorder. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide which he was taking for years, ibrutinib which he was taking for 7 years, levothyroxine which he was taking for 10 years and losartan which he was taking for 8 years. The patient had no any other vaccine prior to covid vaccine. It was reported that the patient received the Pfizer covid vaccine on 03Feb2021. 24 hours later (04Feb2021), he experienced pain in the ears, headache, chills, and fever up to 101.5 for almost a week now, and currently is hard on hearing and had been feeling weak and lacking appetite. It was added that a week ago he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 03Feb2021 at 1500PM in the left arm. Within 24 hours the side effects started. He had a pain in his right ear and a headache. Since then he has gradually lost his hearing in that ear and they are following up with an ear nose and throat doctor. On 04Feb2021, he got a fever of 101.5, chills, weakness and no appetite. Since then in the evening he had been having kind of a fever of 100 to 100.5 and she has treated with TYLENOL. The fever comes and goes. In the morning he was normal. Adds his appetite was better but he still has to force himself to eat. She queried if should the patient get the second dose of the vaccine. Patient is scheduled to receive the second dose on 04Mar2021. The patient did not visit the ER. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: up to 101.5, fever of 100 to 100.5, and 101.5 on 04Feb2021.  The outcome of the event loss of hearing, fever, weakness, and pain in his right ear was not recovered; headache and chills are recovered on 05Feb2021; while recovering for lacking appetite.

An 86-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 86-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included two ongoing autoimmune diseases from unspecified dates and an ongoing pacemaker from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included ongoing blood thinners from an unspecified date. The patient experienced he can barely see/he cannot see/his vision is getting worse and worse and vision problems, both on unspecified dates. The patient&#39;s child called and stated that &#34;my father is on blood thinner. He has two autoimmune diseases and has a pacemaker. He developed visons problems within a few days after receiving the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19. Now he cannot take care of his dog. He will not be able to take care of himself. His vision has gotten progressively worse, he can barely see. I spoke to the specialist and other doctors, but they have no information. He will be seeing the doctor in 2 weeks only. I reported the side effects online. It was hard to get medical help because not many people are informed about what might go on with the vaccine. To get him diagnosed has been difficult. They can&#39;t do an MRI on him because he has a pacemaker. He is also 2 weeks out to see a specialist. In the meantime, he cannot see. His vision is getting worse and worse. His next vaccine is coming up too.&#34; The reporter had called and spoke with the director of immunization at the health department. She had also called and talked to VAERS as well. No one could point her to any help. The reporter believed this was probably related to the autoimmune diseases. The patient had no consultation not take the vaccine. The reporter had answered some information on the website while she had been waiting. The rest of the family also had autoimmune issues, and now they were all wondering if it was safe for them to take (the vaccine). The reporter wanted to know if we could provide any recommendations and if her father could get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical outcome of the event was not recovered.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that an 86-year-old male patient started to receive second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot# EN9581) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history includes diabetes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications include carvedilol (COREG), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), repaglinide (PRANDIN), adenosine (TRICOR), metformin and amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). On an unknown date, the patient reported that blood sugar was 130 on that morning. He had his normal breakfast and went to get his shot within about an hour after getting a shot he was home and he was having my lunch. He was halfway through lunch he answered his doorbell and he got extremely dizzy. His lips and mouth felt numb and swollen. On 04Feb2021, his blood sugar was down to 50. There was no reason and no explanation for precipitated drop in blood sugar other than the fact that he had the Covid shot. Subsequently he spoke to cousin of his who is physician to heard of someone who had an adverse reaction like low blood sugar and was hospitalized. Nowhere in the side effects warning doesn&#39;t say anything about diabetic with low sugar and with low population over 65 it seems to me that would great number of people who have diabetes and low blood sugar problem. In case indeed of indication of adverse effect of covid. The patient advised that a warning should be on leaf. At least people have sugar tablets or some form of counteracting low blood sugar especially since these are 5-7 have driven to and he was just very thankful but he had to get the shot in (city). He was driving from (city) on 95 for 70 miles an hour. He would have got dizzy and headache and low blood sugar reaction while he was in transit. He was thankful that he got home in time for this not be a tragedy. It was reported that no other treatment was taken by the patient other than consuming large amount of orange peels. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                he smelled some kind of chemical; he began to feel real bad; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 87-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 in left upper arm shoulder area at single dose for  vaccination; glimepiride (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2 mg, 1x/day (once per day in the morning) for diabetes; vitamin d (manufacturer unknown, lot# 300015, expiration date:  Jan2022), via an unspecified route of administration from 2019 and ongoing at 3000 iU, daily (2000 IUs in the morning and 1000 IUs nightly) for bone and immune health; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, lot# P139558, expiration date:  Aug2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 81 mg, 1x/day for helping thin his blood; apixaban (ELIQUIS, 2.5 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from 2018 and ongoing at 2.5 mg, 2x/day (morning and night) for blood thinner; simvastatin (ZOCOR, 20 mg), orally from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, 1x/day for cholesterol; metoprolol (manufacturer unknown, 50 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg, daily (1/2 tablet once daily (25mg total daily dose)) for an unspecified indication; celecoxib (CELEXA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (1-20 mg tablet once daily) for clinical depression; vitamin c (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205348, expiration date: Jun2023), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 1 DF, daily for supplement to boost immunity; famotidine (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at unknown dose with 2x/day (1-40mg tablet twice daily) for nauseated; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12, 2500 mg, lot# 511333-01, expiration date: Jun2023),  via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2500 mg, 1x/day for supplement; magnesium (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205340, expiration date:  Jun2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (400 mg mostly every day but not strictly every day) to keep himself going; immuneti (manufacturer unknown, Capsule, NDC: 2817636726), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 capsule taken daily  for an unspecified indication. Medical history included bad hearing problem. This consumer called on behalf of her husband to ask about possible side effects he was having. She reported that these possible side effects could be from Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications: glimepiride; Vitamin D; acetylsalicylic acid; apixaban; simvastatin; metoprolol; celecoxib; Vitamin C; famotidine; Vitamin B12; magnesium; and Immuneti. She was concerned about the possible side effects and wanted to ask Pfizer if these possible side effects could be from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications. Caller&#39;s husband was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Caller also got her Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Neither patient or caller had any problems with the product initially. Then her husband had onset of possible side effects last night. Starting 17Jan2021 after patient took his usual night medications, which caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included, patient began to feel real bad. He said he smelled some kind of chemical and caller said she did not smell anything. Patient got to feeling worse and worse and they stayed up fairly late to see if he got to feeling better. When he got up this morning: 18Jan2021, he was feeling some better. He came in the room and when he put his medications in his mouth, before he even got them swallowed, he began to feel bad again-caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included. Patient had been on simvastatin a long time and one time they took him off of this and started it back; he had been back on this for about 1 year. Metoprolol was discarded after 10th and 9th of 2021, documented as provided by reporter. Patient started it maybe 2-3 years ago. Vitamin C was Over the counter product, start date was probably 6-8 months ago. Vitamin B12 was probably started about 6-8 months ago.

                                                Second morning after shot woke up with extremely blurry in right eye that improved slowly as the day went by, but not to previous vision.  Same problem the morning after sleep and over the next day.  Went to opthamalogist on Monday, Feb 1 who immediately referred to retina specialist, seen Feb 2.  Have ongoing treatment for glaucoma, has been stable for years.  I am not claiming this started because of the shot, but it was so close after that I thought I should report out of an excess of caution.

Thinking it may be ear wax or fluid contributing to this issue, I went to an urgent care and they cleaned both ears. They found no fluid or infection, but I still could not hear in my left ear. I made an appointment with an ENT. He also did not see any physical issues and ordered an MRI.

A contactable consumer reported that an 89-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Solution for injection) via unspecified route of administration on right arm at single dose on 23Jan2021, 14:00 (Saturday). The patient medical history included ongoing dementia (He has a little bit of dementia which has been ongoing since unknown date but at least 10 years) and Maybe some thyroid issues. The patient concomitant medication was not reported. On 27Jan2021, the patient slept most of the day/sleeping more than usual, caregiver tried to have him eat something, but he took one bite said it did not taste quite right and had a running fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. It was reported that patient usually wakes up around 9:00 to 9:30 and read his book but on 27Jan2021 he has been in his chair and slept most of the day, about 3-4 hours until around 14:00 to 14:30. The caregiver gave him some Tylenol and he was reading again with events ongoing and persistent. The reporter enquired whether these events were normal after vaccination because he would have had the symptoms onset closer to the date of vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken for fever. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.
