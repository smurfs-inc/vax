                                                I have a reaction to the flu shot so my MD recommended that I premedicate with Zyrtec. I did one hour prior to injection. Around 5 minutes after my injection I could feel my throat swelling. I alerted the nurse and took a Benadryl tablet. The swelling stayed consistent and I was able to breathe so I waited for an hour and then went home. When I arrived home I felt and increase in the swelling so I took another Benadryl. The swelling slightly decreased but was still present for 5 hours post shot and then disappeared.  The only other reaction I had was metallic taste in my mouth and extremely sore arm where injection was given for 2 days.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                extremely bad dry mouth; lips were going numb; facial numbness; rash from his neck to his nipple line; BP was 180/110 / BP stayed around 160/100; felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling; felt flush; uncomfortable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

A 45-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3247) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications included supplements and vitamins. The patient got the COVID Vaccine on the 21st of January the Pfizer one and the following day he felt fine but he has this weird rash on that arm on his forearm, on the top of the elbow and then he kind of started on the other arm and then on the legs a little bit, around his belly and then his tongue looked like he has swollen taste buds or something, but he said he felt fine but the reporter don&#39;t if that&#39;s a side effect. &#34;Should he be worried, should he go to a doctor?&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;Because we weren&#39;t sure what it was, he did take one Benadryl like the ones you find at the drug store and then that was it. And then I put Calamine lotion, so topically couple times just to prevent him from scratching but not regularly just when he feels really, really itchy.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

A 47-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EP7533) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Apr2021 at 11:45 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included Allergy and GERD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient&#39;s 2 weeks prior vaccines included omeprazole, daily vitamin B-12, D3. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID vaccination was none. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. COVID tested post vaccination was none. On 08Apr2021 at 11pm, the patient reported that she experienced momentary loss of hearing (seconds duration) in each ear, which seemed to resolve, but currently she has persistent tinnitus in both ears. The patient reported that she did not take any treatment for the events and the events led to physician visit. Outcome of events was not resolved.

                                                I had right sided headache for the first two days, then resolved.  The right sided headaches recurred along with right tongue numbness initially on 12/29/2020.  The symptoms worsen on 12/31/2020 and severe on 1/1/2021.  I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

Symptoms lasted a few minutes.  By the time I was evaluated at the emergency department a few minutes later I was feeling much better.  I did not need to take any medications.  7 hours later I began experiencing itching all over my body however, I never developed a rash.  My heart rate slightly increased.  Simply did not feel well.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes and again resolved without having to take any medications.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

                                                Dose 1 -Muscle twitched on injection into R deltoid.  Immediately after injection experienced warm and cold sensations through right arm,  intermittent pains along arm.   Was asked to be observed 30 mins  post injection.  Sent home.   Paresthesias (intermittent warm, cold, tingling sensations) continued with radiation into right axillary, and into neck.  Experienced  intermittent  facial tingling.  On day 3 post injection, started with burning eye discomfort in right eye.   Went to eye doctor to rule out eye infection.   No eye infection,  Instructed to use Refresh drops.   In 4 days subsided.   Day 7 experienced ear flushing and warmth that last 3 days and subsided.    Saw a neurologist to rule out nerve damage.   EMG was normal.   ANA titer was 1:40 with speckled and cytoplasma pattern.   My last ANA was negative when tested for inflammation due to back pain few years prior.     Neurologist  did not think this was an allergic reaction and since symptoms were gradually improving recommended second dose.   Symptoms fully resolved after 2 weeks  Dose 2 - Jan 19 , 2021 (21 days post) -  Decided to inject left deltoid to avoid trauma to right arm.     Was observed 30 mins and released.   No symptoms.     Moderate arm soreness x 4 days.   Day 3 post injection developed burning eye discomfort, intermittent tingling sensation in arm, warm/cold sensations.   Pain radiating to shoulder and neck.   Day 6  started very mild tingling and warm sensations in in cheek and chin area.  Also experienced intermittent prickly sensations in throat and sensation of throat tightness  predominantly on left side. (but no actual swelling).    Today (Jan 26, 2021) is Day 7 and these intermittent sensations are persisting.   Arm soreness has resolved.   Right eye burning discomfort improving.

Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included hypertension, high blood cholesterol from unknown dates. Allergy information was not provided.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility.  Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), fenofibric acid (FENOFIBRIC ACID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive. Treatment for the events was reported as Motrin and Tylenol for fever and Delsym. for cough. The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                Diagnosed day after 2nd shot with opthalmic artery thrombus causing vision loss/change in left eye.  I did get shot series on 12/22/2020 #1 and 1/10/2021 and was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 12/13/2020.  My internist MD did not feel the vaccine caused the thrombus /Stroke but I wanted to report it as it was associated with the vaccine administration (symptoms of vision loss within 24 hours of the vaccine #2 administration).

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

About a day or so after 1st phizer shot the volume and intenity of tinnitus increased. Also added a lower octave static like sound in left ear that was not there before.  My 1st shot was March 17 about 9:30 am. My ears still ring almost 2 1/2 weeks now with the increased intensity. Afraid to get second shot, which I am supposed to get on Wed Apr 7.

A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

My arms, chest, back, and legs. As the day went on and I moved around, the hives disappeared. Before going to bed, I noticed that my left eye was mildly swollen. The next morning, I woke up and the hives returned. Again, after moving around, the hives went away. Later in the late afternoon and into the evening, I noticed that both of my eyes were swollen and so was my upper lip. I woke up and the hives returned, only one eye was swollen and my lip was swollen. By later in the afternoon, the hives and swelling had just about disappeared. The following morning, I was back to normal with no hives and no swelling around my eyes or lips.

                                                Almost immediately, my peripheral vision became filled with moving shapes. And, though I typically do have the black floaters, these are different. Most were white, and looked similar to pinwheel fireworks. Later, I noticed that my peripheral vision started included &#39;moving patterns&#39; with zig-zag shapes, and these patterns would move in random directions. Finally, there are the stationary patterns, where, again, in my peripheral vision,  random shapes  would appear to filled with  the zig-zag lines mentioned earlier, but the filled shape itself was stationary.

At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

                                                On 1/10/21, approximately 48 hours after the 2nd dose in the COVID vaccine series, I experienced ringing in right ear for about one hour, followed by sudden, complete, single-sided hearing loss in the right ear.  The next day, some hearing was restored in the right ear but it was muffled. Examined by primary physician, and both both ears appeared normal. Referred to an otolaryngologist  for an examination and hearing test which showed high-frequency hearing loss in the right ear.  Prednisone 50 mg daily prescribed, with follow-up exam and hearing test schedule for 1/20/2021.  No change in hearing, as of 1/17/2021, still muffled hearing with &#34;full feeling&#34; in right ear.
