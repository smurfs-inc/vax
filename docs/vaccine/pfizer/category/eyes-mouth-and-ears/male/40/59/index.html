                                                I have a reaction to the flu shot so my MD recommended that I premedicate with Zyrtec. I did one hour prior to injection. Around 5 minutes after my injection I could feel my throat swelling. I alerted the nurse and took a Benadryl tablet. The swelling stayed consistent and I was able to breathe so I waited for an hour and then went home. When I arrived home I felt and increase in the swelling so I took another Benadryl. The swelling slightly decreased but was still present for 5 hours post shot and then disappeared.  The only other reaction I had was metallic taste in my mouth and extremely sore arm where injection was given for 2 days.

The Tinnitus is shifting in quality at times. Doing some head tapping on the lower back of the head with my fingers does temporarily help with the symptoms.

                                                Within 8-10 minutes I had a wave of heat start from the back of my head to the front, like the feeling you get right before you go under from anesthesia. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

Medical history included blood pressure (as reported). Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, both for blood pressure. The patient just took the vaccine on Wednesday (13Jan2021) and had a reaction, not sure if it was from the vaccine or not and he was just calling that in to report that as it can be related. The patient got vaccinated on Wednesday at 2 O&#39; clock and no major issues, just sore arm. However, Friday (15Jan2021) afternoon he had woke from a nap and his eye felt irritated. He was still experiencing a swollen eye. So, he was calling about the swollen eye, red eye. He never had something like this before, didn&#39;t take anything that might cause it, the only thing unusual was because he got the vaccine. Treatment included using a cold compress only, not ingesting anything. The outcome of events sore arm, eye felt irritated and red eye was unknown, swollen eye was not recovered.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                After the first vaccination I had a scratchy and sore throat. 42 hours after the second vaccination, I developed hives all over my chest, neck, and back and my tongue swole and became numb. I went to urgent care and the symptoms began to diminish, but the doctor prescribed prednisone and antihistamine.

My ability to breathe was unaffected, but it was incredibly difficult to swallow, like I could not generate any saliva naturally. Approximately 20 minutes after that, my tongue went numb. The symptoms went away several hours later after taking a couple of doses of Benadryl and Loratadine.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

                                                10 min after injection, my mouth started getting hot, then it moved down my throat and it was difficult and painful to swallow. I got quite dizzy. They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

I did not develop any other symptoms (no SOB/difficulty breathing, etc) My R ear is fine too. I observed myself to see if the redness/itchiness will spread but after about an hour or so, the redness and itchiness went away. I did not take any antihistamine and did not I apply any hydrocortisone. Just went away on its own.  Four days later, it happened again, my L outer ear turned red again, this time it is not itchy but more like throbbing pain. It went away after 1-2 hours without any treatment.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine around 17:30 today and states that he developed hives down his left arm and was having difficulty swallowing. He does have a known egg allergy and states that he has had prior anaphylaxis reactions to the flu vaccine. Patient was given PO Benadryl with complete relief of his symptoms. He has no complaints at this time and states that he feels &#34;perfectly fine&#34;. At bedside for initial evaluation. Discussed plan for continued Benadryl throughout tomorrow and follow-up with his PCP. Patient is agreeable. Plan for discharge. The patient is comfortable with further observation of his symptoms at home.  I discussed our workup, answered all questions and made sure there were no other concerns.  I provided counseling about standard home and self-care measures and advised on standard return precautions including new, persistent, or worsening / concerning symptoms.

That lasted about 60-90.  After the pressure subsided, I was left with a semi severe ringing in my ear for about 2 days before diminishing to a slight ringing that continues to persist.

                                                Rapid onset of blurred vision and partial blindness, confusion, inability to form complete or coherent thoughts or sentences.  Started with blurred vision around 5:45pm. I immediately sat down on the couch, and tried to explain to my wife what was going on. However, I was unable to complete the thoughts I was trying to form. Eventually I began confusing words (such as saying &#34;king&#34; when I wanted to say &#34;kind&#34; or &#34;kite&#34;) and was unable to produce more than one word every 1-2 seconds with great difficulty. Then a headache came that was both extremely painful and somehow &#34;painless,&#34; as if I was observing myself having the pain as a bystander. All of this happened within one minute of onset.  I laid down and after about 10 minutes from onset the difficulty speaking subsided and I could make complete sentences, although with some difficulty. After around 20 minutes from onset my vision had fully returned.   I called 911 out of concern for stroke-like symptoms. The dispatcher sent an ambulance, and I was taken to the Hospital Emergency Department for treatment.  Around three hours after the onset of the incident I was diagnosed with a complex migraine and discharged.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

At about 29-30 hours, noticed mild numb feeling along right jawline from middle of mouth to right ear, and around the right ear. By morning (about 48 hours post vaccination), numb feeling appears gone on right jawline, but seems to have moved to left jawline (still mild). No trouble breathing or eating at all. Consulted primary care doctor out of concern over odd sensation, but not treatments at this time. Considering taking a benadryl tablet just to see if it has any effect.

He reported that after returning home he has dizziness and weakness that lasted 45 minutes and then resolved without treatment.  He did not seek care. On the day of his second shot (2/22/21) he said he had not taken his blood pressure medication that morning.  His blood pressure was143/98 and pulse 70 prior to vaccination.  At 10 minutes after the injection he reported feeling dizzy and having shortness of breath and feeling dry mouth.  His O2 sat was 98%.  Pulse had increased to 82 and then several minutes later was 110.   He was placed on a monitor but a large size cuff was not available at the vaccination site.  He continued to feel weak and more short of breath, so he was given a dose of epinephrine by autoinjector and EMS was called to transport him to the ER.  At the ER, he was given diphenhydramine and his condition continued to improve.   He was observed in the ER for 3 hours and discharged home.

A 45-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3247) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications included supplements and vitamins. The patient got the COVID Vaccine on the 21st of January the Pfizer one and the following day he felt fine but he has this weird rash on that arm on his forearm, on the top of the elbow and then he kind of started on the other arm and then on the legs a little bit, around his belly and then his tongue looked like he has swollen taste buds or something, but he said he felt fine but the reporter don&#39;t if that&#39;s a side effect. &#34;Should he be worried, should he go to a doctor?&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;Because we weren&#39;t sure what it was, he did take one Benadryl like the ones you find at the drug store and then that was it.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

The second night after the vaccine the tinnitus was quite bad, then the next day it settled down to be two or three times as noticeable as my baseline tinnitus was prior to the vaccine, at least. At this point, normally don&#39;t hear it, but when I&#39;m going to sleep it&#39;s very noticeable. Ten weeks later, it&#39;s steady and hasn&#39;t gotten worse or better since  it steadied out on the third day.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that he felt fine after the shot for the rest of the day and the first night other than the soreness where he received the shot. The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date with sequelae (recovered with lasting effects).

                                                Tinnitus.  Continuous ringing in ears that will not go away.   I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

In the mirror I see the arches around the uvula swollen and red 11:50 Inform the nurse. Body starts shivering, talking and breathing is labored- according to my wife my voice sounded very different.  Nurse checks lungs through stethoscope and SPO2&#43; heart rate- All normal, does not detect any constriction of lung air passages. But I am panting while talking. 11:55 I decide to wait and monitor. Shivering slowly stops, breathing slowly starts to return to normal (in about 20 mins). The urge to pass stool stopped. 12:22 No change either way- Breathing is ok, but mild tingling around lips, and feeling of tightness at back of throat. I take 5mg Cetrizine HCl.

A 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 at 15:00 or 15:10 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. It was reported that the patient had no pre-existing conditions and was &#34;100% healthy and normally ran every day for 2-3 miles.&#34; Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient did not have a history of adverse events that followed prior vaccinations. The patient previously received the flu shot in Sep2020 (at the age of 47-years-old) for immunization and experienced no side effects. It was reported that the patient received a flu shot every year and experienced no side effects. On 16Mar2021 the patient experienced fever, pain in back and pain in neck that went up to his head; on 17Mar2021 the patient experienced headache; on 18Mar2021 the patient experienced does not feel from his waist down on left side, does not feel from his waist down on right side, weakness on right side, weakness on left side, passed out and on unspecified dates the patient experienced Guillain Barre syndrome, lost hearing on right side and high blood pressure. The events does not feel from his waist down on left side, does not feel from his waist down on right side, weakness on right side, weakness of left side and passed out (911 was called) required an emergency room visit; does not feel from his waist down on left side, does not feel from his waist down on right side, weakness on right side, weakness on left side and Guillain Barre syndrome also required a physician office visit. The patient was hospitalized for the events passed out, does not feel from his waist down on left side, does not feel from his waist down on right side, Guillain Barre syndrome, weakness of right side and weakness of left side from 18Mar2021 to 08Apr2021 (also reported as &#34;for 22 days&#34;). The reporter (friend of the patient) called to file a report for his friend, who did not speak any English. The reporter wanted to make Pfizer aware of the adverse event that the patient experienced. The reporter stated that the hospital staff stated that they reported the patient&#39;s adverse event to Pfizer, the local health department and the CDC, but the patient&#39;s family and friends were not sure if the report was filed, thus the reporter was calling. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;6-7 hours after getting home from getting the vaccine on 16Mar2021, the patient started to feel fever, pain in his back, and pain in his neck that went up to his head. The hospital had given the patient Tylenol and the hospital staff informed the patient that if he felt a fever or pain after the COVID-19 vaccine, he should take the Tylenol. The hospital staff also informed the patient that if his symptoms got worse to call 911 and go to the emergency room. The patient took the Tylenol and his fever came down a bit and the patient went to sleep. On the next day, 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s neck pain started going up more like a headache. On the morning of Thursday, 18Mar2021, the patient got weak. The patient could barely move his hand or neck or leg. After the weakness began, &#34;it was like 1-2-3&#34; and the patient was passed out. After the patient passed out, 911 was called and when emergency personnel arrived, the emergency personnel thought that the patient had had a stroke. When the patient woke up on 18Mar2021, the patient was unable to feel from the waist to all the way down. The medical staff at the hospital did a lot of testing on the patient, MRIs and all that stuff, and all of the test results were coming back negative. The medical staff took some fluid from the patient&#39;s back after the patient was in the hospital for 2-3 days. The results came back negative until 2 weeks later when the patient&#39;s friends and family were informed that the patient had Guillain-Barre Syndrome. The patient&#39;s left side got a little improvement with medicine, but the patient&#39;s right side did not get any improvement.&#34; The patient&#39;s fever was treated for the first few days while hospitalized, the patient no longer had a fever. The patient was also treated for high blood pressure for the first few days that he was hospitalized. The reporter was informed of the patient&#39;s hearing loss &#34;after the patient started speaking good, about 3-4 days after the patient had the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 16Mar2021. The patient was losing hearing before that, but the patient was not able to talk to the caller or family a lot.&#34; (as reported). The reporter did not provide details on medications administered during the patient&#39;s hospital stay. The reporter stated that the patient was just discharged from the hospital and sent home.

The reporter stated that the patient should have been back to normal health before having been discharged from the hospital. He did not know why the patient was discharged.

The patient took Advil Migraine for his headaches which did not work, or only worked for 10 minutes and then the pain would come back. The hospital referred the patient to a different facility. The reporter stated that the patient could not get an appointment with this facility for up to 2 months from now. The patient could not wait 2 months for relief. He could not be like that with a headache and no feeling on his right side for 2 months. According to a different doctor the patient needed &#34;more IVIG, immunoglobulin and needed to get attention from a neurologist to watch him until he got better.&#34; The patient had an appointment scheduled with a neurologist for Monday 26Apr2021 at 08:00.

                                                I had right sided headache for the first two days, then resolved.  The right sided headaches recurred along with right tongue numbness initially on 12/29/2020.  The symptoms worsen on 12/31/2020 and severe on 1/1/2021.  I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

                                                In the past, I have had a very mild  and intermittent case of tinnitus.  However, immediately after receiving my first Pfizer dose -- within an hour -- I noticed that my tinnitus got much, much worse and louder -- it became a constant loud hissing in both ears.  More than a week later, the tinnitus is almost debilitating --  CONSTANT and never getting any lower.    A &#34;whooshing&#34; sound that just won&#39;t stop.  It&#39;s maddening.    I&#39;ve never had tinnitus this bad in my life and there is no reason for it to have gotten worse besides the vaccine.    It is high-pitched, and constant, and this is two weeks after receiving my dose.     It&#39;s only getting worse -- there has been no hint of quieting down.   I am very upset over this and it&#39;s obvious that my tinnitus got severe directly after I got the first Pfizer vaccine.   I&#39;ve been living at home alone for the last year so it&#39;s certainly not due to loud music or anything like that.

                                                Feb 15, 2021 Monday, I started feeling pain on the right portion of my neck; Feb 16, 2021 Tuesday, I felt the pain radiating inside my right ear and had a mild headache.  Tuesday evening, my wife noticed that I am not fully blinking/closing my right eye; Feb 17, 2021 Wednesday, I didn&#39;t have the same pain but there&#39;s numbness on my right cheek extending to my right lips.  Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

It was as if I&#39;d burned my mouth with hot coffee. Pain was intense enough to wake me at night and make eating solid food difficult. I had to use topical benzocaine to get through meals.   The episode lasted a full week before subsiding.

Things I loved before the vaccine I can no longer tolerate because they taste so bad. I am eating ice so I don&#39;t dehydrate.  This is the worst experience I have ever had and I doubt that I will get the second dose.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot EN6201, first dose) solution for injection intramuscular in the right arm on 24Feb2021 at 17:00 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing irritable bowel syndrome from Mar2020 and acid reflux (esophageal). Concomitant medication included ongoing lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux (esophageal) from Nov2020. The patient stated his diarrhea worsened 2 hours after receiving the vaccine (24Feb2021 at 19:00) and had diarrhea again around 10 pm. The patient stated hearing loss was already there and the vaccine actually exacerbated the situation in 2021. The patient also experienced ringing in my ear in 2021. The patient&#39;s nurse, primary care doctor, and gastroenterologist stated it was okay to receive the vaccine as the patient was in the middle of a flare up with his IBS (inflammatory bowel syndrome) in 2021. Treatment for the event hearing loss exacerbated included unspecified steroids and has been working. The outcome of the events diarrhea worsened and ringing in my ear was unknown. The outcome of the events hearing loss exacerbated and having a flare was recovering.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

                                                Dose 1 -Muscle twitched on injection into R deltoid.  Immediately after injection experienced warm and cold sensations through right arm,  intermittent pains along arm.   Was asked to be observed 30 mins  post injection.  Sent home.   Paresthesias (intermittent warm, cold, tingling sensations) continued with radiation into right axillary, and into neck.  Experienced  intermittent  facial tingling.  On day 3 post injection, started with burning eye discomfort in right eye.   Went to eye doctor to rule out eye infection.   No eye infection,  Instructed to use Refresh drops.   In 4 days subsided.   Day 7 experienced ear flushing and warmth that last 3 days and subsided.    Saw a neurologist to rule out nerve damage.   EMG was normal.   ANA titer was 1:40 with speckled and cytoplasma pattern.   My last ANA was negative when tested for inflammation due to back pain few years prior.     Neurologist  did not think this was an allergic reaction and since symptoms were gradually improving recommended second dose.   Symptoms fully resolved after 2 weeks  Dose 2 - Jan 19 , 2021 (21 days post) -  Decided to inject left deltoid to avoid trauma to right arm.     Was observed 30 mins and released.   No symptoms.     Moderate arm soreness x 4 days.   Day 3 post injection developed burning eye discomfort, intermittent tingling sensation in arm, warm/cold sensations.   Pain radiating to shoulder and neck.   Day 6  started very mild tingling and warm sensations in in cheek and chin area.  Also experienced intermittent prickly sensations in throat and sensation of throat tightness  predominantly on left side. (but no actual swelling).    Today (Jan 26, 2021) is Day 7 and these intermittent sensations are persisting.   Arm soreness has resolved.   Right eye burning discomfort improving.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 08:48 am (lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included facial paralysis from 20Jan2021 to an unknown date diagnosed initially as bell&#39;s palsy but now is diagnosed as myasthenia gravis and gastric reflux. Concomitant medication included unspecified gastric reflux medication and unspecified vitamins. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior and did not receive other vaccine on the same day. The patient previously he was put on prednisone 60 mg tablets by mouth times 7 days, then 10 mg tablets for an additional 7 days. The patient mentioned he received the vaccine in a vaccination center. The patient reported that prior to his first shot towards the end of Jan2021, his doctor thought he had Bell&#39;s Palsy. On 20Jan2021, he stated that he was put on a high dose of steroids to clear it up. He stated that on 09Mar2021, he had his first Covid vaccine with no issues. On 12Mar2021 between 5-6 pm, he mentioned that it came back (the Bell&#39;s Palsy) with a vengeance, near his eye and with eye droop. He specifies left eye droop. He added that the Monday after (15Mar2021) over the weekend, it got worse. He mentioned that he talked with his neurologist who told him to speak with his ophthalmologist who the patient spoke to on Tuesday. The patient mentioned that both doctors came up with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. He inquired since one of his doctor&#39;s is concerned about him taking the second vaccine and the other doctor was ok with it. He mentioned that one doctor had a feeling of some bias, and the other doctor. He did some research in an association with people diagnosed with it. One of his doctors said that he is immunocompromised, so he looked at autoimmune information, and the information says it is ok. He reached out to the local medical center that is doing the vaccination and they are unwilling to talk with him over the phone. He has read on the association site and they seem to recommend to take it. He did not want to rebel against his doctor, so he wants to be sure. He inquired if it was safe for him to take his second dose and wanted to get good factual information that can give him a good starting point that is related. He mentioned that his second dose schedule was on 30Mar2021. He also stated that initial onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy with left eye droop, he was on a high dose steroid regimen and that seem to help which he finished up early Feb2021. It was mentioned that the event initial onset was not after the vaccine. The Ophthalmologist checked him on Tuesday and his left eye which he could barely open, and his doctor also noticed right eye droop. He stated without medication, it is worsening but with his medication, it is definitely helping to transmit between nerves. He stated before the medication this time of day he could not lift his left eye longer throughout the day, the more difficult it is for the muscles as they become weaker. There was noticeably drooping of the right eye. The ophthalmologist exam on his right eye was drooping which was ongoing. It is still there, his wife and he were comparing their eyes and how much he could open it, and it surprised them how little he could open it. It was different and strange. The time reported for the drooping of the right eye was 2:30 pm and persisting but the left eye was worse. He hasn&#39;t noticed a difference about the same, medication has been helping. It was also mentioned that myasthenia gravis reported that it started on the 16Mar2021 2:30 pm (talked to the Neurologist to compare notes, so maybe 3:30 - 4:00) when they made the initial diagnosis and started testing the next day. He is waiting for blood work to come back, but all the tests have pointed in that direction. Myasthenia gravis was ongoing, but the condition has worsened and the medications at a therapeutic level, it keeps it at bay. He further added that his eye became so hard to see, so he pyridostigmine bromide on 17Mar2021 since he couldn&#39;t open or focus, he thought he would give it a try. It works when he can&#39;t focus and if he doesn&#39;t take, it he will go back to where he was before. He will not be able to open his eye and the double vision will come back. The events required physician&#39;s office visit but did not require emergency room visit. He mentioned that there were 3 test and one more scheduled. The first one was a common test; the first initial test diagnose Myasthenia gravis. The second test was the ice test since they went on the assumption in their initial thinking it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and in his, doctor&#39;s, opinion it didn&#39;t look right. The test sounds goofy and it is one of the tests, they did to predict how it was going to go. He reported that they placed an ice cube in a cloth on the eye and let cool for 2-3 minutes. The eye lid is raised more than it was before the test and it went back down. This test was done on 16Mar2021. He reported that the did a chest x-ray on 17Mar2021 and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal. He has a CT scheduled next Wednesday (24Mar2021) to check his thalamus and lungs. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test with unknown results on 17Mar2021, he reported that he is waiting for the results to look for antibodies for Myasthenia gravis; chest x-ray was normal on 17Mar2021, he reported that they did a chest x-ray and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal; endoscopy with results of no finding on Mar2021, his GI doctor wanted to do an upper and lower endoscopy, so 2 weeks prior to the vaccine he had an upper and lower endoscopy with no finding; and ice test with results of bell&#39;s palsy on 16Mar2021 and in his doctor&#39;s opinion, it didn&#39;t look right. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Slept very soundly that night.  For the rest of the week, I needed a 5 to 6 hrs extra sleep every day.  I missed a week of work because of fatigue.  On 3rd and 4th days after shot I had diarrhea. On 3rd and 4th days after shot I had slight nausea.  Slight ringing in ears on days 2, 3, and 4 after shot.  Only slight fatigue on 5th day after shot. All other symptoms gone.  6th day after shot all symptoms gone. I feel fine. I&#39;m glad I was vaccinated.

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

Duration of about an hour after washing face and flushing eyes with warm tap water. Rinsed mouth with antiseptic and drank plenty of water. Things I know to do when anything I&#39;ve ingested sparks the warning signs with the tearing up of the left eye. Since I cannot afford Epipens, I wonder if it would have helped if I was not able to breath during this reaction?

                                                Fairly rapid onset of excess fatigue, difficulty keeping eyes open associated with oscillating vision, near simultaneous distortion of sound (at the time was watching a show using my phone, and the actors no longer sounded like themselves), sense of subtle disequilibrium, and a sense of intense heat involving my upper abdomen and lower chest, centered around my xiphoid process as if being pressed up against a space heater, the latter symptom was non-painful, perhaps the best example is the feeling one has after receiving intravenous contrast dye for CT imaging although more the &#34;warmth&#34; was more intense. Lasted 90-120 minutes before going to sleep, then gone by morning.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

                                                Chronic tinnitus significantly increased in intensity/volume the day following the first injection--I estimate about double the volume. In both ears. After 12 days it has not subsided at all. The increase in severity is causing secondary headache, jaw clenching, sleeplessness, irritability, hearing issues.

                                                The evening of the vaccine I had minor  tongue swelling. The next night after eating Tuna I had the tongue swelling again with some Tachycardia and a severe headache with red welts all over my body. I also had tightness in my throat. I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours. I took Prednisone for five days.

The next day (3/7) the right side of my face was numb and showing symptoms of what doctors later decided was Bells Palsy. on 3/7 I had fatigue and general feeling bad like I had the flu. On Monday 3/8, I was feeling worse and I called the advice nurse who advised I go to the  Emergency room due to right face partial paralysis, numbness, and face drooping. They diagnosed Bells Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and prednosone. From 3/9-12 the right side of my face was numb, droopy and I had ear pain and a lot of fatigue. By Saturday 3/13 I was feeling better and have gradually gotten better through today 3/26. I still have numbness in my right cheek. and occasional tingling in my lips. My doctor has advised me to go ahead and get the second dose of vaccine tomorrow 3/27. Also, during the week of 3/7 - 3/12 I had some dizziness and a general foggy feeling in my head.

                                                Worsening of tinnitus. Already had mild case with a high pitched sound in both ears, but mostly my left. About a day or so after 1st phizer shot the volume and intenity of tinnitus increased. Also added a lower octave static like sound in left ear that was not there before.  My 1st shot was March 17 about 9:30 am. My ears still ring almost 2 1/2 weeks now with the increased intensity. Afraid to get second shot, which I am supposed to get on Wed Apr 7.

                                                Tinnitus increased dramatically approximately 4 days after first Pfizer vaccine. It slowly subsided and then again spiked a few days after my second Pfizer vaccine shot. It has ever so slowly subsided since the spike after the second shot, but is still much louder than prior to shot one.

He complained of an itchy forehead, which we began to monitor.  He then felt thickness of the base of the tongue, tingling of the lips.  He was given an oral dose of 25mg of Bendryl.  We began to monitor his pulse ox levels.  He remained at 98-99 sat on room air.  His heart rate ranged from 60-68.  He then experienced more itching of the arms, and continued itching of the forehead, thickness of the tongue.  A second oral dose of 25mg Benedryl was given.  After continual monitoring for 45 minutes his symptoms began to subside.  After another 15 minutes he felt his symptoms had resolved.  His final pulse/ox reading was 99% with a pulse of 67.  He was instructed to follow up with his PCP.  He was also instructed to monitor himself for further symptoms.  ER protocols given.  He left on his own.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

                                                Approximately 20 minutes of receiving the first dose of Pfizer COVIN19 vaccine, I started to develop a metallic taste in my mouth.  Shortly after the metallic taste started, saliva production decreased causing severe dry mouth and it became difficult to swallow.  I went to the closest hospital which was approximately a 10 minute drive from when symptoms started and explained what was going on to the person at the triage desk.  I did NOT request to be seen by a doctor because symptoms had started to lesson but I did wait at the ER since it was a public place for approximately 30 minutes before traveling home.  Approximately 2 hours after onset of symptoms, saliva production had returned to normal levels.

The ring has not stopped since getting the 1 st shot . I saw my Primary doctor and did all my blood work wand checkup and everything came back normal and refereed me to   a ENT doctor Facility.  He said everything look normal  and said it must be the Vaccine that caused the Tinnitus.

It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since. Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, Lot number; unknown) via intramuscularly on the left arm on 07Feb2021 at 9.30 am (at the age of 55-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that, after 5 days taking the vaccine, on 12Feb2021 at 12:00 AM I started to have ringing of the ears. I never experienced this and it has occurred for the past 2 days in both ears. I need to know if I should hold off on the second doses and if this ringing of the ears has been reported for other patients taking your Vaccine. I am scheduled for my 2nd shot on 28Feb2021. Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have covid prior vaccination. Patient did not tested covid post vaccination. No treatment was received for the event. Outcome of event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I looked at my pupils and they were pinpoint to slightly bigger.   My glasses are auto tint, but not so much behind car windows.   When I got home I sat in a dim room(lights off, but sliding door blinds closed but some light coming in) for an hour eating lunch.  I then checked my pupils and they were about a third the size of my iris.    Mild headache, dull eye pain and squinting continued.   I searched the internet and found no details about eye problems.  I called, ask a nurse and was told they found no information about eye problems at CDC or internet related to vaccine, but perhaps it is headache causing eye problems.    Seems like this should be listed somewher!  Or do I need to see my opthalmologist?   You should be complete in side effects that eye problems are possible.   I had no problems prior to vaccine.    Do with this what you will(likely ignore it as you are bidens cdc).

They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

Volume fluctuates. Sounds like crickets or an electronic hum/buzz sound. Very disturbing and it&#39;s hard to concentrate and hard to sleep. The research I&#39;ve done indicates this is Tinnitus.  I don&#39;t know yet if this is permanent.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic. Glucose 117 mg/dl (79-115 normal range), zinc 54 mcg/dl (60-120 normal range), CMV IGG AB &gt;10 u/mL (positive is &gt; or = 0.7 range). The outcome of the events was unknown.

I then became goofy. Started laughing etc. Then in the drive home about 20 minutes later I started to be tired. I was in the phone with a friend and slipped into a deep slumber. The next day Saturday I woke groggy like from a hang over minus the headache. I had a sudden urge to eat , i bacon and egg sandwich with mayo then had a urgency to eat a bowl of cereal. (rice crispies. Then tried to work (remotely from home) but I could not concentrate or focus. Finally I just threw in the towel and went back to sleep. Woke up to send this report.  Good night. I still recommend this inoculation to everyone!

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

My arms, chest, back, and legs. As the day went on and I moved around, the hives disappeared. Before going to bed, I noticed that my left eye was mildly swollen. The next morning, I woke up and the hives returned. Again, after moving around, the hives went away. Later in the late afternoon and into the evening, I noticed that both of my eyes were swollen and so was my upper lip. I woke up and the hives returned, only one eye was swollen and my lip was swollen. By later in the afternoon, the hives and swelling had just about disappeared. The following morning, I was back to normal with no hives and no swelling around my eyes or lips.

A 57-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscular, in the left arm, on 05Jan2021 07:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications were unspecified. The patient took unspecified medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for covid-19 post vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. On 07Jan2021, the patient experienced diplopia due to left 6th (abducen) cranial nerve palsy. The event resulted in doctor office/clinic visit, and emergency room visit. Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event which included fresnel prism on current glasses to alleviate diplopia. Outcome of the event was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported diplopia due to left 6th (abducen) cranial nerve palsy and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Historical vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2(lot number: ELO142) on 06Jan2021 01:00 PM in right arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced ringing in ears and hearing loss that is continually worsening on 29Jan2021 12:00 with outcome of not recovered. AE resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. it is unknown whether treatment was received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible temporal association, and lacking any reported alternative explanations, a causative role of BNT162B2 vaccine for the reported worsening of ringing in ears and hearing loss cannot be excluded.

                                                Experienced a delayed reaction to vaccine that occurred at 11 p. m.  Administration was at 8:23 a. m. earlier in the day.  Symptoms began as build up of mucous in back of throat and reflux. Very early the next morning symptoms progressed to near inability to swallow,    Took 50 mg of Benadryl which gave a bit of relief.  Very hard to drink the water and get it down with the two pills.  The symptoms included swollen lips and inside of the mouth swelling.  Went to the emergency room at the Clinic  at 7:30 a. m.   I was given 60 mg of Prednisone, Pepsid to coat the stomach re the steroids. Was sent home with prescription for epi pen, medrol dose pack, Pepsid and Zyrtec.  Symptoms improved except for swelling of lips.  However, on 3/11/21, despite taking the medication, the symptoms worsened in terms of renewed lip swell as well as new symptoms of facial flushing and chest flushing.  Symptoms then abated with medication.  On 3/13/21, symptoms flared again with renewed lip swelling, inside and outside check swelling and outside face and chest flushing.  They they abated again with medication.  On 3/14/21, lip swelling renewed as a symptom.  To date, my lips do not feel right but tingly and bloated and irritated.  Saw an allergist this morning who thinks I am allergic to polyglycol a preservative in the vaccine.

                                                Almost immediately, my peripheral vision became filled with moving shapes. And, though I typically do have the black floaters, these are different. Most were white, and looked similar to pinwheel fireworks. Later, I noticed that my peripheral vision started included &#39;moving patterns&#39; with zig-zag shapes, and these patterns would move in random directions. Finally, there are the stationary patterns, where, again, in my peripheral vision,  random shapes  would appear to filled with  the zig-zag lines mentioned earlier, but the filled shape itself was stationary.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the vaccine i started to get very bad chills and body aches and also fever that reached 102. Every bone in the body felt like it was cracking. This lasted about 24 hours. I was also sweating a lot. The sweating at night lasted 3 days. I have the dry mouth and tongue with a thick layer of saliva and the mouth is swollen. I also have very dry eyes and nose/throat. These also are the after side effects of covid which i had in mid jan that i was getting better from. After taking the vaccine the symptoms of swollen mouth and thick saliva including dry eyes flared up again. Today is day number 6 after the vaccine and its a little better but not much.

At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

The next day, some hearing was restored in the right ear but it was muffled. Examined by primary physician, and both both ears appeared normal. Referred to an otolaryngologist  for an examination and hearing test which showed high-frequency hearing loss in the right ear.  Prednisone 50 mg daily prescribed, with follow-up exam and hearing test schedule for 1/20/2021.  No change in hearing, as of 1/17/2021, still muffled hearing with &#34;full feeling&#34; in right ear.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

                                                Pt started developing a droopy right upper eyelid on Friday night (01/29/21) and by the time he woke up on Saturday, his right upper eyelid was completely shut and he couldn&#39;t open at all unless he physically used his finger to open the lid. Pt also experienced double vision when opening the eye. Pt went to the Emergency Dept and was given an MRI and CT to r/o stroke and everything came out normal. He was diagnosed with a partial 3rd nerve palsy and was referred to Optometry where we saw him on Monday (today). Pt does indeed have a partial right 3rd nerve palsy which can happen after vaccinations.

Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

It has increased subsequent to my second dose on 3/4/2021. I had no other significant symptoms after my first dose, but did have sufficient pain at the injection site in my left upper arm the day following my shot to wake me up at night. That went away within 48 hours, but the tinnitus effects have not decreased to date.

                                                3/18/2021 I noticed that I could not clear my ear the next morning my eye lid felt like it was dragging across my right eye and I developed Severe pain in and around my left ear running down into my neck. Shortly later I had less and less control of the right side of my head, now I can&#39;t  move it. I have since discovered that I have Bell&#39;s Palsy due to the vaccine. I didn&#39;t know what it was until I went to the doctor as this has never happened to me before.
