                                                I have a reaction to the flu shot so my MD recommended that I premedicate with Zyrtec. I did one hour prior to injection. Around 5 minutes after my injection I could feel my throat swelling. I alerted the nurse and took a Benadryl tablet. The swelling stayed consistent and I was able to breathe so I waited for an hour and then went home. When I arrived home I felt and increase in the swelling so I took another Benadryl. The swelling slightly decreased but was still present for 5 hours post shot and then disappeared.  The only other reaction I had was metallic taste in my mouth and extremely sore arm where injection was given for 2 days.

                                                After waiting 15 minutes I was released and felt fine. About 3-5 minutes after leaving the site my tongue became numb and felt s=slightly swollen, throat became extremely dry, pulse rate increased from low 50 BPM to 100 BPM. Drove to a nearby store and stopped, felt a bit disoriented when trying to call my wife. Drank water and waited at a store for approximately 15 minutes until I felt better. This was about 40 minutes after the vaccine was administered. When driving home still some discomfort/numbing of the tongue and throat. Ate at 1:30 and symptoms had stopped.

The Tinnitus is shifting in quality at times. Doing some head tapping on the lower back of the head with my fingers does temporarily help with the symptoms.

                                                Within 8-10 minutes I had a wave of heat start from the back of my head to the front, like the feeling you get right before you go under from anesthesia. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

Woke up this morning with a strange pain in my left eye socket, felt like a headache but inside my eye ball, it goes away when I sit and lie down and comes back when I stand up.  Vision in that eye was blurry, but slowly returning.  Continue to have muscle aches and fever, but they are lightening.

                                                note I was moderately anxious prior to getting the vaccine and had a busy day the next day which was worrisome in case of side effects.  dizzy first day, chills, fast heart. Everyday so far feel off and on tired, dry mouth off and on, dehydrated?  Felt tired within an hour of injection on Tuesday.  I don&#39;t remember if my stomach was growling on the first night on the day I got injected and I just went to bed.  The next morning I woke up really thirsty/hungry and tired. I slowly made myself breakfast. Sat down to eat on a stool and felt dizzy. My heart raced for 30 sec as I carefully made my way to the flow to be safe. I had the chills, a bit shaky for a short period. I called my doc who told me to stay hydrated. The clinic where I got injected DID NOT inform me about dehydration. As of today, I still have off and on a dry mouth, feel more of an empty stomach at meal time, tired off and on, and maybe dehydrated. I work from home so I am not pushing myself. I have not felt dizzy again and am decent at taking in water now.

                                                Ii got he vaccinator on 3/5 and went home.  the first night around 9p, I started to feel chills, Had a really big temporal headache.  I thought it was a reaction to vaccination, I took Tylenol PM, layer down and woke up in the middle of the night, in a full body sweat.  I went strait into chills, changed my clothes.  Layed back own and awoke the next morning, with chills and temp of 101.  I had body ache but proceeded with my day.  I continued to have chills, I went out to my elderly parents, took them food and had dinner.  Upon arrival home, had high fever 103...no Tylenol.  Awoke still w/ chills and high fever and this was Sunday.  Stayed in Sunday then the afternoon, felt like I needed to seek help.  I went to get a rapid test at Medical Center and it came back Neg.  Went back home, I could now sense that my taste was altered.  I then continued to have a high fever but they would only come at night.  Body sweat, aches, chills cont&#39;d on Sunday.  Monday still had same s/s and Tuesday, I thought that I should seek more medical attention.  I went to an Urgent Care 3/9/21.  They then did a nose swab and felt that it would come back Neg.  I went home and on Thursday 3/11/2021 I got a call that I was positive.  Did isolate.  But from 3/5 to 3/11 then I lost taste/smell.  Came out of isolation 3/20 and on 3/21 my whole left side of fact, shoulder and leg went numb for approx 1hr.  Then my wife said that I was talking a little slow in my response.  Next morning my left shoulder was hurting and I had pain.  The Urgent care provider wanted to r/o TIA  so he sent me to ER for full work up and that doctor said he saw nothing.  He didi say that it could be Covid related and/or possible TIA.  &#34;I am feeling good today&#34;  There is no residual but because of the left shoulder pain I did go back to Urgent Care.  Got cortisone inject and MRI.  My PCP then told me that I had a partial &#34;tear&#34; in my left shoulder but I do exercise every day and could have done it then.

After 10-15 minutes, he came to the pharmacy counter stating he felt hot and sweaty.  His eyes then rolled backwards and he collapsed on to the floor.  He was unresponsive, his head and back arched and he slightly rocked while on the ground.  I went to make sure he didn&#39;t hit his head and patient became responsive.  We tried to have pt stay on the ground, but he refused.  Therefore we moved him to a chair and elevated his legs.  911 and store medical assistance were called. After the ER services arrived and examined pt, left on his own and stated he felt fine now.

Started to get sharp chest pains near my heart then started to feel fatigue. Then my tongue started to get swollen/numb and I couldn&#39;t really talk. Went to urgent care and due to my condition they called the ambulance and went to hospital. They did an EKG/chest x-rays and blood work. Couple hours later they send me home with no diagnosis just to see primary doctor.  Symptoms were mild for 2 days then again on 5/14 symptoms came back and went back to urgent care. They did an EKG/Covid test/ only and doctor just said it was a panic attack. I disagree I still don&#39;t feel completely right.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

Medical history included blood pressure (as reported). Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, both for blood pressure. The patient just took the vaccine on Wednesday (13Jan2021) and had a reaction, not sure if it was from the vaccine or not and he was just calling that in to report that as it can be related. The patient got vaccinated on Wednesday at 2 O&#39; clock and no major issues, just sore arm. However, Friday (15Jan2021) afternoon he had woke from a nap and his eye felt irritated. He was still experiencing a swollen eye. So, he was calling about the swollen eye, red eye. He never had something like this before, didn&#39;t take anything that might cause it, the only thing unusual was because he got the vaccine. Treatment included using a cold compress only, not ingesting anything. The outcome of events sore arm, eye felt irritated and red eye was unknown, swollen eye was not recovered.

Feels like intense pressure/blockage, but still able to voluntarily open the tube (pop your ears) and no increase in mucus discharge or congestion. No swollen lymph nodes in the neck.  Pain got up to a level 6/10. Took Extra Strength Tylenol and went to bed early. Following day it still aches some, about the same as the arm area of the shot. Not sharp pain any longer but sore.

I otherwise felt fine and had a normal day of moderate physical activity.     I awoke in the middle of the night with chills and body aches and a strong feeling of anxiety.   I was able to fall back asleep and woke up as normal a few hours later.  I had a very strong head ache centered behind my sinuses,  body aches in my pelvis and legs, and hot flashes mixed with chills.  Aches were manageable with Tylenol.  As the day progressed those continued and I was very fatigued.   I went to bed earlier than normal and after a full night&#39;s sleep symptoms subsided.

He already went to the physician about it. He was scheduled to go to Ear Nose and Throat doctor on 12Apr2021. He stated they checked his ear and everything. The hearing loss was not related to any kind of ear wax or anything.  He went to urgent care, so they were limited to what they can do, and he was referred out to Ear Nose and Throat. He said everything sounded muffled and liked a constant buzzing in that ear. He had never had this problem. That doctor was going to check his ears and would do a hearing test on 12Apr2021.

I went to bed that night, and woke up just after midnight to tremendous ringing in the ears.  I thought I was hearing something outside, but it was in my ears.  I also had very sore body muscles.  I got up the next day the the symptoms persisted.l throughout the day.  The body aches slowly diminished and eventually went away, but the constant ear ringing has persisted.  Today is the 9th.

Malaise;  Night sweat about 36 hours after first dose;  Chills all night one night after the second dose.

My whole body was sweating and my vision was affected (everything was bright).  I was able to return to the store but was close to passing out.  I sat down for about 10-15 minutes while the symptoms persisted and I was not able to see well.  After that time the sweating stopped and my sight was no longer affected.  This was not anxiety and I have no history of fainting with shots.  This was a reaction to the shot.  After about an hour I felt fine except for muscle soreness at the injection sight.  If the reaction was any worse I would have passed out or asked for help.  I am hesitant to get a second dose out of concern that the reaction could be worse.

                                                Shortly after my shot I developed a phantom smell of smoke, while it is not an unpleasant smoke smell, it smells like firewood burning in a fireplace.  It is concerning because I can&#39;t tell if I am smelling a real smoke smell or a phantom smell should a fire occur.  It goes away but comes back.  I notice the smell more when I am getting ready to go to sleep or when I am not actively doing anything .  At first I thought it was someone in my neighborhood burning firewood all the time, but as time went on I asked my wife is she smelled it and she said she smells no smoke.  So I just monitored my self, but as of today I am still experiencing the phantom smells since March 2021..

I have sporadically experienced ringing in my Right ear as well but not nearly to the extent I have in my left ear. I also experienced frequent, daily headaches for about the first month or so after the shot. I also experienced neck/right shoulder stiffness for about 3 weeks following the shot. I continue to wake up on a daily basis with a feeling in my head and ears like I&#39;ve been listening to loud music or been in a loud sporting event for several hours (on top of the still nonstop/constant ringing in my left ear that will not go away). I have also experienced swelling in my feet and ankles anytime i&#39;m active for an extended period of time

No change in diet, working conditions or lifestyle other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccination.   Patient has been monitoring blood pressure at home with a machine and at the clinic. Average blood pressure is 143/90 with some readings as high as 160/95 and as low as 118/80 (after waking up on day 3 of a hospital stay).

                                                Immediate weird taste in his mouth (&#34;like licking a kitty litter box and made his snickers taste gross&#34;), dizziness, and nausea after getting the vaccine. Brain fog, dizziness, and nausea continued for the rest of the shift. 5 hours after the vaccine (10pm) he was very fatigued. When he woke up the next morning his arm felt like it &#34;was in a vice&#34; and he is still hazy.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

Uncontrolled palsy for head and neck intermittently through the injection day.  I lost my voice and had spasms in my larynx.  For several hours I had a hard time choosing my words and speaking which was the scariest.  I could not focus enough to even wash my hands on injection day and had to be driven home from work.   I got dehydrated because water tasted horrible.  The next morning I am better on all fronts except the ringing in my ears wont stop

Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

A 42-year-old male patient received the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm left, on 01Apr2021 14:00 (at the age of 42-year-old), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. No additional vaccines administered on same date. Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as &#34;no&#34;. No relevant family medical history. The patient experienced pressure in both ears on 01Apr2021; tinnitus, a constant ringing in his ears on 01Apr2021; the pressure was so painful in one of his ears/felt like it was physically painful on 01Apr2021; and debilitating headache on 06Apr2021. The patient had the vaccine on 01Apr2021 (reported as &#34;last Thursday&#34;), and the same night, he developed pressure in his ears and tinnitus, basically a constant ringing in his ears. The pressure was so painful in one of his ears that it felt like it was physically painful. He compared it to a child having their first ear ache- it was maybe something like that combined with a really bad headache. He clarified he had a debilitating headache, and it was probably so bad that he considered for a moment going to go to the hospital but he did not, instead he took three ibuprofen (ADVIL) and that helped. Patient had not been to the doctor yet in regards to his symptoms, and stated he had a scheduled appointment Friday with an ENT doctor. Patient didn&#39;t have pressure in ears before the vaccine. He had constant ringing in his ears that doesn&#39;t subside. There&#39;s a link between his symptoms and the vaccine. He was in completely normal shape before he decided to get the vaccine. Patient&#39;s weight was 225-230 lbs (unknown date). The outcome of the events &#34;pressure in both ears&#34;, &#34;tinnitus, a constant ringing in his ears&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

                                                initially began as what felt like jolts to my chest area from inside my chest over five days beginning on March 31, 21 @ 1:20am; next on April 01, 2021 @ 12:02am; then April 02, 2021 @1:02am; then April 03, 2021 @ 1:36am; and on April 04, 2021 @ 2:46am. I ended up in the emergency room the afternoon of Sunday March 04, 2021 with severe chest, abdominal, and intestinal pain. I followed up with doctors on April 05, 2021; April 09, 2021; and April 28, 2021 with continued painful symptoms described below. All they has done so far is 1) took a chest X-ray, 2) taken blood, and 3) referred me to a sleep laboratory.  The X-ray and blood work came back negative per ER.  Symptoms: 1. Inability to sleep. most nights feels as if I just drank five cups of coffee before bed. When I am able to fall asleep, pain and/or jolts coming from inside my trunk/core area wake me up within about an hour.  2. Constant pain coming from my chest, abdomen, and intestines. Intestinal and abdominal pain (gut wrenching, pain/burning sensation, cramps). At times feels like radiation or waves/currents are passing through my intestines/trunk. I wake up with intestines feeling sore. I also have discomfort when I eat or drink something the following morning. Also, my trunk/core area feels tight all day and night. I constantly feel a burning sensation in my chest and gut areas. The discomfort in my chest area (tightness, burning sensation) with occasional burst of pain the size of a nickel that comes from the left side of my chest and underneath my rib cage.  3. Limbs twitch/jerk on their own (both hands, both feet, neck, both shoulders, both legs, fingers) during the day and during the night. tingling sensations in legs.  4. ringing in the ears with headaches. 5. Woke up from sleep due to both nostrils getting clogged while I slept; woke up gasping for air.  6. Penis no longer has the same sensation and difficulty with erection.

About 1 1/2 weeks after the dose, he started to get significant fatigue.  He started to sleep poorly.  He developed arthralgias described as bilateral, distal joints (hip down, wrists mainly).  He developed tingling sensations in his arms and legs.  He has had mental fog.  He had some HA and eye pain.  His PCP sent him to the ED for evaluation.  He was evaluated by neuro consult on 4/4, had an LP.  THe LP only showed some elevated protein (somewhat traumatic tap based on 10 RBC in tube 4).  MRI brain, cervical/thoracic spine was unremarkable.  He was dx w/ possible post-infectious polyneurophathy, and suggested f/u w/ neuro clinic for further eval.  Pt reports his paresthesias lasted 2 days and has since resolved.  He has not been seen by outpatient neuro clinic yet.  He did have a post LP HA which he returned to the ED for.  He reports that the HA has resolved.   In the past 2-3 days he has had felt less fatigue.  He still has arthralgias, continuous.  They do not seem to be worse in AM or PM.  He can do most activities and just tired working out this week.  Activity does not seem to make it better or worse.  The joints are not red or swollen but feel &#34;tight&#34;.  He has not noticed any fevers but gets occasional nightsweats or sometimes feels flush and measures only a low grade temp that does not last (&lt;100F).  He has had slight decrease in wt but no change in appetite.  No n/v/d.  NO cough, sob, CT/CP, wheezes. No rash. He does have some sinus sx&#39;s which he thinks could be c/w seasonal allergies.

The head pressure sometimes is mostly on the left side and shifts to sinus pressure and left ear pressure. When the head pressure shifts to sinus and ear pressure, dizziness subsides. The head pressure almost everyday but there were a few days where the the pressure subsided. Took zyrtec for 4 weeks but had no effect. Took flonase for 1 week and had no effect. Sudafed sometimes helps relieve pressure for a few minutes but it persists soon after.

                                                Medical assistant gave an initial Covid vaccination to her patient. While he was waiting his 15 minutes post vaccination to monitor for reactions, she noticed he was staring blankly at her. She asked if he was ok. Site Lead overheard her ask the patient and came into the room. RN noticed that he was slumped over and having a seizure. RN picked him up and placed him on the floor on his side. RN told MA to get an onsite MD and advised another RN in the room to call 911. Patient continued to seize. Blood pressure, oxygen level, and glucose levels were checked. All were within normal limits. Patient awoke and told RN he has a history of seizures but has not had his medication for a couple months. He stated that he has seizures when he gets nervous or upset. His last seizure that he could recall was a month ago. He then went into another seizure. EMS was on the scene. He came out of that seizure quickly. They placed oxygen on the patient. He wanted to sit up. RN helped him to sit up and helped him walk to the stretcher. He was awake, alert and oriented to person, place and time when he left the clinic. He was transported to Hospital per his request.

Ears became full with fluid and pressure then extreme tinnitus developed.  My regular doctor prescribed 2 different antibiotics which had zero effect on tinnitus. It is  almost 12 weeks after the tinnitus began and I still have ringing in the ears. It has reduced to 50% over the 3 months. I have never experienced this symptom previously and it has become the worst health event in my life.  I have not been exposed to any loud sounds. I have been to see 2 ENTs and they believe the condition is permanent. I had a CT scan completed and it shows there are no issues. I am hoping it is inflammation and will go away over time.   I am currently taking Prednisone and hoping it reduces any possible inflammation.  The ringing and popping noises in my ears need to stop ASAP.

                                                The pharmacist carelessly gave me the second shot of my Pfizer.Some dribbled out of the arm.. without asking my permission he gave me a second dose Basically overdosing me. My tongue felt strange my lips sweated.  The injection site hurt for 7 days and is still uncomfortable.  My lungs have been extra congested with mucus.  I missed 3 days of work due to the inability to use my left arm (sore) and general fatigue. Experienced strange twitching of the left arm muscle at injection site on the third day.

                                                10 min after injection, my mouth started getting hot, then it moved down my throat and it was difficult and painful to swallow. I got quite dizzy. They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                I received my first dose of Pfizer vaccine (lot # EN6200) around 10 AM. I was perfectly fine after the shot. However, 6 hours later around 4PM my Left outer ear turned bright red and get itchy (no raised or macular rash, no hives, no signs of insect bites or anything) No other redness or rashes in any other parts of my body. I did not develop any other symptoms (no SOB/difficulty breathing, etc) My R ear is fine too. I observed myself to see if the redness/itchiness will spread but after about an hour or so, the redness and itchiness went away. I did not take any antihistamine and did not I apply any hydrocortisone. Just went away on its own.  Four days later, it happened again, my L outer ear turned red again, this time it is not itchy but more like throbbing pain. It went away after 1-2 hours without any treatment.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

                                                Approximately 25 -30 min after receiving vaccine I felt pressure in my left ear, the side of the shot, and listening to my car stereo sounded like I was underwater.  That lasted about 60-90.  After the pressure subsided, I was left with a semi severe ringing in my ear for about 2 days before diminishing to a slight ringing that continues to persist.

                                                Rapid onset of blurred vision and partial blindness, confusion, inability to form complete or coherent thoughts or sentences.  Started with blurred vision around 5:45pm. I immediately sat down on the couch, and tried to explain to my wife what was going on. However, I was unable to complete the thoughts I was trying to form. Eventually I began confusing words (such as saying &#34;king&#34; when I wanted to say &#34;kind&#34; or &#34;kite&#34;) and was unable to produce more than one word every 1-2 seconds with great difficulty. Then a headache came that was both extremely painful and somehow &#34;painless,&#34; as if I was observing myself having the pain as a bystander. All of this happened within one minute of onset.  I laid down and after about 10 minutes from onset the difficulty speaking subsided and I could make complete sentences, although with some difficulty. After around 20 minutes from onset my vision had fully returned.   I called 911 out of concern for stroke-like symptoms. The dispatcher sent an ambulance, and I was taken to the Hospital Emergency Department for treatment.  Around three hours after the onset of the incident I was diagnosed with a complex migraine and discharged.

It is piercingly loud when exposed to loud noises.  It started the day after the vaccine injection. Other events are: - Frequent headaches (every 2 or 3 days).  They started the day of the injection and are current. - Sore throat.  It started 2 days after the injection and has decreased in the last few days. - Dry throat and chills.  They started a week after the injection and are current. - Soreness in the arm where injected.  This has gone away. I visited my healthcare professional about this.  No treatment was given.  The healthcare professional decided that we&#39;ll have to monitor the symptoms for any changes.  If the tinnitus gets worse or persists after a month, then it is suggested that I see an ENT (Ear, Nose, &amp; Throat) doctor.

                                                Upon presentation to Tent 4, participant identified himself as being, &#34;a big baby when it comes to needles&#34;.  Received vaccine to LUE and was waiting in Obs area with son (who reported only being seated for approx 5 mins.).  A loud noise was heard and participant was observed laying out prone on the floor.    Clinicians assisted him to roll over where his eyes were red, wide-open gaze, and diaphoretic but was not responding to commands.  After turning him to his Rgt side he began to sit up and became slightly combative and was able to be calmed down.    Moved to Tent 6 to cot via wheelchair where is RUE BP was 180/100 at 11:09, and Lft radial pulse taken by MD was &#34;60 and weak&#34;, Resp 16 and unlabored so no oxygen in use but nearby.  Upon further assessment, participant repeatedly stated that, &#34;he just did not feel well&#34; and when probed, c/o frontal headache, nauseated (but did not vomit), and weak.  Offered water to sip and by now lip no longer bleeding.  When asked, &#34;what did you feel prior to falling out of your seat?&#34;, he stated, &#34;I just remember that you all were around me asking me questions...hence could not recall moments leading up to being found on the floor and no type of aura was identified as well.  Reported a h/o HTN but did not take his medication today...other history is unremarkable.    Ambulance arrival approx 11:13, VS taken, assessed and transported to nearest facility.  Family returned and later reported that he sustained only a large &#34;goose-egg&#34; on the forehead and fat lip but otherwise was treated and released.

Around day ten the tinnitus ceased in left ear but continues in right. Intensity varies from day to day and never disrupts sleep or poses any difficulty in hearing or concentrating. I mention the pitch as any momentary tinnitus I&#39;ve experienced in my life were fleeting (minute or less), accompanied by muffled hearing, and much lower pitch. Tinnitus persists to today, 4/7/21, and I&#39;ve scheduled my first appointments for intervention with a specialist (ENT).

This lasted for maybe a minute or two.. about an hour later my legs became very itchy. This lasted maybe a minute and was immediately followed by my face getting flush again. This also lasted about a minute. Maybe 15 minutes later the same two events repeated in the same order. Both again lasted maybe a minute.   During this time there was a little bit of tingling around my lips. This came and went for a few hours.   15 or so minutes after the 2nd round of itchy legs/face flush, my throat became itchy for a couple of minutes.   I did go to the urgent care and while was told by that doctor that as all of these had come and gone within a minute or so and that my breathing had not become an issue that I didn&#39;t need an epi shot and that I could just go home.   I didn&#39;t experience any further allergic reactions, just the expected ones.

In addition, the morning after the injection I woke up with a bright red face rash and draining on the left nostril, the left eye crusted shut with yellowish drainage, a red blister-like spot on the left lower eyelid, bloodshot eye, and swelling from the eyelid and down into the cheek. The swelling got worse after a couple of days, leading to medical treatment with eye drops and an antibiotic.

This was 28 min after initial shot (2nd dose).  Concerned that airway would be restricted.  In a panic went to ER at different hospital that I was near.  No signs of anaphylaxis.  Waited in hospital for ~3 hours.  Symptoms did not get worse and could breath through nose.  Decided no steroid shot (did not want to negate covid shot).  Went home without additional treatment.  Mouth was dry for 1 additional day, but not as extreme as initial dryness.

                                                1. Immediately upon injection, my tongue started to go numb, and it was numb/tingly within 10 seconds.  2. Over the 15 minutes I sat and waited, the sensation spread to much of my mouth and started to go down into my throat. I did not feel like anything was swelling per se, but definitely numb.  3. At 15 mins, it still seemed to be progressing, so I notified staff and went back to the first aid area. I was monitored and we waited to see what would happen. The numbness went a good way down my throat.  4. When I had some water, I noted that I was able to swallow fine but could barely feel the water going down. I also noted the tingling sensation had spread to the lower part of my face (that had been covered by my mask), though my face was not completely numb -- it felt like when local anesthetic is wearing off.  5. I stayed for a while longer, was evaluated by a doctor, and was eventually released. The numbness largely subsided by 4-5 hours after injection.   6. Notably, I have never had any sort of reaction to a vaccine before. 7. Concerned at a stronger such reaction to the second injection, an immunologist suggested I skip it and instead.

                                                Received 1st Shot 4/10/21.  A few days after 1st Shot of Pfizer: My eczema flared up and I was waking up from itching in the middle of the night. I was being treated for eczema for a few months prior to vaccination. I had never woken up from itching prior to vaccination. Flare up areas were on shoulder opposite of vaccination arm. This area had never flared up before. Also had period of flare up behind right knee for first time as well. All of these were more severe than before vaccination.  I used topical steroids sparingly in the few weeks after 1st Dose. After 3rd week it seemed to ease.  Received 2nd Shot 5/1/21.  After 2nd Shot of Pfizer: I had Tinnitus side effect in both ears seemingly from the vaccine. I did not have worsening skin rashes/eczema after 2nd Dose.I did not have Tinnitus after 1st dose.  2 weeks later, symptoms seem less but not completely gone. Eczema is similar to what it was before both vaccine doses.

Then prescribed methylprednisolone for a six-day course of therapy. Will see physician again in less than three weeks.  No improvement. Only less and less hearing in the right ear.

                                                With my 1st vaccine I just had soreness around the injection site. After the 2nd vaccine I woke up at 4am on 1/31/2021 with muffled hearing in my left ear and mild numbness in the entire left side of my body from top of my head to bottom of my feet. I experienced vomiting and diarrhea also. I had blood pressure of 150 /105 and pulse rate of 100. My doctor was afraid I had a stroke, so I went to the ER and had a CT scan in brain. I tried to go to work the next day but my head was foggy so I had to leave work. I had a test for carotid arteries and heart test that came back fine. I was sent to a neurologist. He suspected I had possible swelling in the spinal cord, but since I was feeling a little better he thought it was ok to wait to have a spinal tap. He described that the symptoms were MS dialed symptoms but did not feel I had MS. I&#39;ve gotten better but continue to have a neuropathy pain in my left foot, left hand, and left side of my face. It tends to get worse at night but in the morning it is ok. It continues through the day. None of these symptoms were there before the vaccine.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

I haven&#39;t eaten anything or done anything out of the ordinary prior to or after my vaccine shot.  Since the vaccine is the only thing different in my life and it has been a few weeks i thought it was the only common denominator that would be causing this feeling.  it doesn&#39;t affect anything in my daily life other than a bit of an annoyance to constantly feel this.

I thought nothing of the shortness of breath as I am asthmatic. The next couple of days I felt completely drained, fatigued. Ten days later I have partial facial paralysis. I saw the emergency physician at the hospital who prescribed prednisone, acyclovir, over the counter eye drops, and an eye patch to wear at night.

                                                Tinnitus.  After receiving my first shot on February 19, 2021, I began to experience a faint and intermittent ringing in my right ear and ignored it.  After receiving my second shot on March 12, 2021, the ringing in my right ear became louder and has continued.  Sometimes is it still faint and intermittent, and other times it is more intrusive and distracting.  At this point, I have not sought treatment, but may do so if it continues.

Once it finished traveling, approximately 10 minutes after shot, the taste of metal appeared on the back of my tongue. The numbness passed within 15 minutes of the shot and then pain began radiating from the shot to my elbow every few minutes. I had a feeling that could be best described as inebriation after about 15 minutes and could smell pizza to be specific. There was no pizza around. This went away within about 10 minutes of onset. I slept for about 4 hours, woke up with a headache, and arm pain for 2 days.

I went to doctor and was prescribed Amoxacilin.   I thought hearing loss could have been from minor infection.  Once antibiotics were complete and I still could not hear (&amp; tinnitus) I went to primary doctor and he prescribed Methylprednisolone (a steroid).  That treatment has now completed and hearing loss &amp; tinnitus still persist.

                                                This is sharing a concern / reporting a concern. This is not a complaint against anyone. This is not reporting side effect. The adverse effect date and time is a mandatory field. This is the reason I filled adverse date and time. I had my 2nd dose of vaccine on April 25, 2021 at campus at 1.20 PM. I just felt the syringe just touched the peripheral of my skin. I told the nurse that I do not feel I get the shot. Later, I do not feel any side effect any effect. I had no pain, or the site of injection was not swollen. I am worried I did not get the 0.3ml dose. During the first shot on April 4, 2021 at 1.43 PM, I felt pain on shoulders. I felt my tongue got thickened/ some tingling sensation on tongue and a little slur in speech. After 6 hours, I felt headache, a little chill, light head, nausea, more pain on shoulders and the next day, I felt light headedness and I felt tired for few days. I consider these as normal side effects and nothing unusual from what I read in internet and what I heard from others. So, I did not report it and it was a normal thing for me. Since I experienced this in first dose, I expected a more severe reaction than first dose. But I did not even feel pain at the site of injection nor any usual symptoms that usually appear. This made me to doubt I got required dose or the vaccine was correctly withdrawn from the vile. I do not know how to confirm that I got correct dosage. If I have not received the full dose, I am ready to take an additional shot and I would be flexible to take the shot at the available time near to my living place on any day.  Again, I am not complaining anything. Probably the nurse is very proficient in taking shot with no pain. I do not know why my body does not react to the second dose.

I can still hear quiet sounds, at least in other frequency ranges. But it is quite annoying, particularly when I am in a quiet environment with nothing to distract me.

I lost my sense of smell 10 years ago due to sinusitis. I experienced lethargy about 5 days after the shot up to 4 weeks after. I had some tightness in my chest, my albuterol inhaler helped with that. The  tingling in my hand and feet happened on a few occasions. I had numbness that lasted about an hour. I had frequent night sweats that woke me. I had muscle tightness in my leg and abdomen. I also had soreness in my arm, which made it hard to grasp a pen. I did test my reflexes which were normal.

                                                polyneuropathy; facet joint diagnosis/new left forefoot paresthesia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 45-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot EJ1685) at the first dose in left arm on 17Dec2020 12:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.

No any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. It was reported that 20Dec2020 morning: new left forefoot paresthesia. no weakness. Patient thought this might be due to the back pain he had been watching for 3 months, thinking it was due to running/physical therapy overuse injury.

On 24Dec2020 9 pm, paresthesia both hands and feet, no weakness nor other symptoms those continued and were slightly worse on 27Dec2020 morning, including face/teeth. no other symptoms; 27Dec2020 afternoon: internal medicine physician evaluation, working diagnosis polyneuropathy. Neurologist appointment will be 07Jan2021, 2 hours before 2nd shot was scheduled. The patient had been tested for COVID-19 test type post vaccination: negative on 22Dec2020.  No treatment for event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Outcome of events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of polyneuropathy and facet joint diagnosis/new left forefoot paresthesia due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.

At about 29-30 hours, noticed mild numb feeling along right jawline from middle of mouth to right ear, and around the right ear. By morning (about 48 hours post vaccination), numb feeling appears gone on right jawline, but seems to have moved to left jawline (still mild). No trouble breathing or eating at all. Consulted primary care doctor out of concern over odd sensation, but not treatments at this time. Considering taking a benadryl tablet just to see if it has any effect.

At 10 minutes after the injection he reported feeling dizzy and having shortness of breath and feeling dry mouth.  His O2 sat was 98%.  Pulse had increased to 82 and then several minutes later was 110.   He was placed on a monitor but a large size cuff was not available at the vaccination site.  He continued to feel weak and more short of breath, so he was given a dose of epinephrine by autoinjector and EMS was called to transport him to the ER.  At the ER, he was given diphenhydramine and his condition continued to improve.   He was observed in the ER for 3 hours and discharged home.

A 45-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3247) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications included supplements and vitamins. The patient got the COVID Vaccine on the 21st of January the Pfizer one and the following day he felt fine but he has this weird rash on that arm on his forearm, on the top of the elbow and then he kind of started on the other arm and then on the legs a little bit, around his belly and then his tongue looked like he has swollen taste buds or something, but he said he felt fine but the reporter don&#39;t if that&#39;s a side effect. &#34;Should he be worried, should he go to a doctor?&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;Because we weren&#39;t sure what it was, he did take one Benadryl like the ones you find at the drug store and then that was it. And then I put Calamine lotion, so topically couple times just to prevent him from scratching but not regularly just when he feels really, really itchy.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

                                                Within 4hrs of receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine I began to experience ringing in the ears followed by onset of extreme headaches and body aches somewhat dissimilar from the flu. These aches felt like painful internal construction of the head neck back and thigh muscles. Severe pain in the left arm where I received the jab.  I was extremely fatigued and could barely make it from bed to the bathroom. I treated the condition with Tylenol 1g every 4hrs followed by 200mg of Motrin. I also ensured adequate fluid hydration and electrolytes 120&#43; oz per day. The symptoms continued for about 36hrs. I began to feel better but 48hrs later I relapsed with the onset of ringing ears then headache followed by extreme fatigue. I treated the 2nd round with continued bed rest over 3 days with Tylenol (1g) and Motrin (400mg). I eliminated Tylenol day 2. I reduced Motrin to half on Day 3. I felt better for 48hrs and again relapsed but only needed smaller 200mg doses of Motrin for a day along with bed rest. The ringing in the ears have been consistent since the onset of the symptoms 4hrs after receiving the 2nd shot. The ringing is greater when I?m active and late in the day. The ringing in the ears is less after min of 6hrs full sleep during the night. I have yet to be able to exercise since racing that 2nd dose. I?m slowly progressing in reducing the fatigue by consuming 30mL shots of ginger juice daily along with 500mcg of  Vitamin B12 as directed by my Dr.

Then it turned in to tinnitus by about 7pm. of moderate intensity, lasting for about 5 hours that night. Was bad enough did not think I&#39;d be able to sleep, but abated while reading in bed, and was gone in morning. No further issues since.

We was leaving when his wife and his mother mentioned he had swollen eyes. Pt said he was feeling well and that his eyes were fine. However, family member insisted he had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and he mentioned he started to feel lightheaded and nervous afterwards. His BP was 107/81 mmHg and pulse 100 bpm and he mentioned he wanted to take something for allergies, so patient was given 50 mg Benadryl after confirming his weight (80 kg). After 15 minutes waiting, patient mentioned he was feeling fine, and he wanted to leave. BP was taken again and it was 125/76 mmHg and pulse was 89 bpm. Pt refused calling 911 because he was feeling ok and he did not feel his eyes swollen.

                                                2 days after my second shot I broke out in Hives and welts down my torso, Arms, and legs. I went to urgent care and they gave me a shot of prednisone and gave me a pack of the same steroid to take over the next 6 days they also prescribed some prescription Claritin and Famotidine.. The following day 4/16/21 around 1130pm I woke up to my face being swollen as well as my tongue. I was taken to the ER where the triage unit gave me epinephrine as well as another steroid to stabilize the swelling as I was having trouble breathing. Once stabilized I was released and took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6 hours as well as the Claritin, famotidine, and the prednisone. I had hives for a few days after and followed up with my primary doctor, but as of today I feel like i am back to normal.

I had a web-call with doctor and he asked that I report my symptoms.  I have a follow-up in one week and if the smell doesn&#39;t improve, he will refer me to an ENT specialist.

                                                When I woke up the day after (Day #2) being given the vaccine I was extremely tired exhausted, I had intense chills and hot flashes. Never a fever. I felt nauseated. Completely lethargic. Muscle aches all over my body, was hard to move. I couldn&#39;t stay awake. My eyes hurt. I had intense migraines.  And no appetite. My right arm hurt, but not as bad as many others&#39; reported.  I took ibuprofen to help, it didn&#39;t. I drank lots of water and gatorade zero for the electrolytes. It didn&#39;t help either.  On day #3, this was when it got scary. The previous  symptoms carried over, minus the nausea and I was able to be mobile (less lethargic).  But something new started to happen. I took my dog out for a short walk, a slow pace, I am very athletic, and I had shortness of breath. I was winded from just walking slowly. Then the brain fog started to set in. This I hated the most. I wasn&#39;t able to comprehend things. I tried to assemble an item I bought from Amazon and it was extremely hard to follow simple instructions. I wasn&#39;t able to see clearly for some reason. And even comprehending emails that I was receiving was troublesome. I kept drinking water, and was able to eat a little. Had two more bottles of Gatorade Zero.  On day 3, most of all the symptoms subsided except that I still got winded from movement.  On day 4, I was fine.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

No arm pain -- but nine days of brain pain, waking up feeling like my head was split, at least five days of altered vision, and most disturbed were my breathing and my heart. I felt for many days like I had a Brillo Pad in my lungs and heart, as well as lots of pressure in the chest and shortness of breath/labored breathing. Two days ago I thought I might be having a heart attack. The symptoms lightened yesterday morning (day nine) though I still have strange sensations in the head and taking a full, deep breath is not totally easy yet. .

At this point, normally don&#39;t hear it, but when I&#39;m going to sleep it&#39;s very noticeable. Ten weeks later, it&#39;s steady and hasn&#39;t gotten worse or better since  it steadied out on the third day.

                                                I had a mild COVID-19 infection in January, 2021. My symptoms were mild congestion and slight body ache. I did not lose any sense of smell or taste, nor were those senses altered in any way during my infection. I waited 3 months for my COVID-19 vaccine. About 10 days after I received my first shot of the Pfizer COVID vaccine I started to experience weird tastes and smells with certain foods such as eggs, corn chips and popcorn, and strawberries. I did not lose my sense of smell or taste, but they have been altered. When I eat these foods I have a bad taste and smell. The sensation seems to have dissipated a bit but is still with me 3 months after the first dose.

He says it progressed that evening to numbness and states his spouse noticed slight swelling to his face. He also complained of pain to his teeth and gums. He voiced concerns about bell&#39;s palsy, but stated he didn&#39;t notice any asymmetry or paralysis in his face and his symptoms have resolved entirely as of today 1/4. He was never seen or evaluated while he was having symptoms, unfortunately, and was able to continue working. Denied chest pain or difficulty breathing, no rash. He reports self-medicating with prednisone on sat/sun with improvement and as mentioned, is now asymptomatic.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that he felt fine after the shot for the rest of the day and the first night other than the soreness where he received the shot. The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date with sequelae (recovered with lasting effects).

Itching and swelling subsided with a dose of Loratadine. Nausea worsened that night and vomiting ensued with diarrhea worsening. At bedtime, itching returned, sleeplessness, vomiting and sweating profusely from the scalp and face, slight difficulty filling lungs with air. Another dose of Loratadine calmed symptoms. Wednesday (10th) through the next Thursday (18th ), nausea persisted, but eased with Benadryl and Emerton. Diarrhea persisted through Monday (15th). No fever, no soreness, no headache.

                                                I already suffer from mild tinnitus.  About 14 hours after the 2nd vaccine dose my tinnitus became noticeably worse for a period of about 24 hours.  I also experienced the typical flu-cold like symptoms after the 2nd vaccine dose including muscle ache, stiff and achey joints, and general I&#39;ll feel for a period of 8 after that began 14 hours after the 2nd dose was administered.  I experienced fatigue for roughly 4 days after the 2nd dose.   I had no symptoms nor adverse reaction after the 1st dose.  My biggest concern was the tinnitus.  The cold and flu like symptoms I understand should be expected.

                                                Tinnitus.  Continuous ringing in ears that will not go away.   I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

I got out of bed.  While in the bathroom, I began to feel very lightheaded and passed out while I was washing my hands.  My wife heard me crash to the floor.    I returned to consciousness but passed out again while trying to stand, unresponsive to my wife.  I returned to consciousness after about 1 minute.  I stayed sitting for several minutes while my wife brought me some water.  I felt thirsty and it&#39;s possible I was dehydrated, but I had been drinking fluids (water) the day before as normal.  Due to the two fainting spells and a possible head injury, I went to the Emergency Room for treatment at approx. 2 am.

                                                Within seconds of my first vaccine I had a massive headache. 20 mins later I had brain fog. An hour later I had exhaustion and then injection site arm began hurting. This lasted for 48 hours and then I was fine. It came on fast and stayed. I had difficult time thinking or retaining a memory. Second shot had no instant reaction, injection site just slowly began hurting. An hour later, and very suddenly, brain fog hit me and i lost all short term memory, mid sentence. Similar to what I would consider a form of Alzheimer?s. At the same time I developed a headache, not as severe as the first shot, but I was more exhausted than the first shot. Forming sentences, being able to think was very difficult for 72 hours. I was exhausted, arm hurt. After the 72 hours, I lost my sense to smell. I am in my 96 hour since my second injection and still have no sense of smell. I can taste. Never had a fever but for both shots it felt like it was absorbed by my muscles and was then converted to something else which was then released back into my system. It was like I had sore muscles it was like my muscles became the poison. This effect was grossly more profound  after the second vaccine.  The ability to think was the scariest side effect.

I experienced mild tinnitus after 2nd dose of vaccine and just assumed it would go away.  I&#39;ve never had chronic tinnitus and in general I am in very good health.  I am 5&#39;11 and 170 lbs and very active. I have experienced tinnitus on occasion after a loud concert or other but this is different.  My hearing is otherwise perfect. Due to Covid I am still working from home and very much notice this adverse event as it is rather quiet at home with little background noise.  I have now had this issue for over 2 months and recently have had issues where it is quite bothersome which prompted this report.

                                                Approx 27hrs after 2nd dose I felt my heart suddenly started irregular beats, arrhythmia with dizzy feeling, flush on face which lasted a minute or 2 followed by very rapid / hard beating of my heart (I could see my shirt move on my chest from the beating). This lasted for almost 10 minutes. Very scary. Paramedics were called about 5 minutes into the episode.  (I had a similar reaction of dizzy, flush with rapid and hard heart beat reaction after 1st dose about 5 minutes after it was given which lasted couple minutes then subsided).  When the paramedics arrived, I was laying down in my bed trying to relax and breath. By then the rapid and very hard beating of heart was calming down but was still elevated pulse for a resting position...~128bpm.  My BP was measured at 154/87.  They connected the 12point electrodes and the reading came back normal...only elevated pulse.  Paramedics ran 3 more scans during the  20 minutes they were there for...all came back normal.  My O2 was 100%. I elected to no go to ER since we live only 2 miles from the local hospital and I was feeling much better by then...but would go if I had another heart episode.  I have had none since.  Only other strange side effects was sore arm for 2 day and I notice is constant ringing in my ears all the time...strange.  I hope that will go away soon...very annoying.

A week  later I went to an Urgent Care to have my ear checked out.  I was put on antibiotics.  After that not clearing up my ear, I visited an ENT doctor who diagnosed me with Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss.  I also now have constant Tinnitus in my right ear.  Dr did 2 injections into my eardrum with steroids and I was also put on Prednisone pills for 2 weeks.  After these course of treatments I had no improvement in the hearing loss.

He lay down on the floor, and our technician asked him if he was OK.  I immediately went out to him, and he told me he was already feeling better.  I had him put his feet up on the chair, and he told me that he thought this reaction was due to anxiety.  He was talking and breathing  normally.  I offered to check his blood pressure and get him some water, but he declined.  He rested on the floor for approximately 5 minutes and then said he was feeling well enough to go.

I cannot tell which ear it is coming from since closing off my ear canal does not stop the sound.   The only way to describe the loud sound is a constant sound the cicada makes.  The only time I don&#39;t notice the sound is in loud environments but it is constant if my surroundings are silent.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

Took allegra and it went away in 30-60 minutes. Tongue was sore the next day.  I also suffered a mild anxiety attack at the same time. Treatment for that was meditation and cessation of throat swelling symptoms.  Lastly, I also had a severe flare up of my fibromyalgia symptoms in my forearms starting 3 days after the injection. I don&#39;t know if this was a primary effect from the vaccine, or secondary from the additional nociceptive input from the joint and muscle pain I was experiencing in my forearms. I increased my lyrica to compensate. Two weeks out from the shot I&#39;m almost back to baseline.

                                                this is a positive but odd event: I had a heightened and dramatically improved sense of smell and taste after my shot. I could smell the new plastic smell of my laptop which I never smelt before. It was so odd. And I could really taste the cream in some pistachio ice cream. I can really say this was a dramatically heightened sense of smell and taste.

I started smelling a weird smell every time I washed my hair.  Then it got stronger and stronger as time went on and then also with other smells. It is an awful smell, but only triggered by certain things. I can smell other things just fine.  Also very similar to my taste. Some things taste horrible now. I can&#39;t eat peanut butter, orange juice, nuts, and then many foods taste just ok, and I part of it tastes ok, and part tastes horrible.  About a month after the first vaccine it was at it&#39;s peak and it has stayed the same since.

About 48 hours after Pfizer vaccine dose #1, ears began to feel full/pressure.  The next day was peak &#34;fullness&#34; but also noticed start of tinnitus.  The tinnitus has remained constant ever since.  It sounds like a bilateral/stereo 18 kHz sine wave at 30 dB.   Primary care doc referred to audiologist, audiologist referred immediately after testing to ENT.  After discussing with ENT, was prescribed tapering course of prednisone (60mg/day for 10d, 40mg/day for 4d, 20mg/day for 5d), which I began on 4/14.  Symptom has continued unabated.

He had been feeling ok but that morning experienced sudden onset of severe pain in his hip. He had taken ibuprofen for the pain a few hours before the swelling in his face happened. He has never had any reactions to ibuprofen. He has no known allergies. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before.  The swelling got worse overnight but during the following day the swelling started to go down. By that night it had gone down completely. Now he is fine but his lips look a little bruised, However, now we don&#39;t know if he should get the second vaccination which is scheduled on the 30th April. We did not contact a Dr.

The site had a little bleeding as the male nurse adminiter the dose.  Redness faded but circular yellowish discoloration about 2 inches in diameter is still visible on left arm after 7th day.   2. Eyes started itching the first shot and left eye had itchy corner like dry skin or something.  Itchiness faded then came back again after second shot.  Same reaction, itchy eyes the next day and the left eye corner started itching and drying up.  Applied 1% cortizone to relieve itchiness and dryness on 3rd day.  Seem to have releived the itchiness and dryness but still monitoring it.   Will report this reaction with my provider when I see them next week,

The clogged sensation changes depending on how much I move around, but it has not gone away. I can clear my eustachian tubes, so whatever it is seems to be further in the ear. I can still hear, it&#39;s just muffled in the right ear.  The only other adverse reaction I&#39;ve had was on Monday, April 19, where I had very sore hips/back around 8pm and around 11pm when I went to bed, I had chills as if I had a fever. Those symptoms were gone by the morning of Tuesday, April 20.

In the mirror I see the arches around the uvula swollen and red 11:50 Inform the nurse. Body starts shivering, talking and breathing is labored- according to my wife my voice sounded very different.  Nurse checks lungs through stethoscope and SPO2&#43; heart rate- All normal, does not detect any constriction of lung air passages. But I am panting while talking. 11:55 I decide to wait and monitor. Shivering slowly stops, breathing slowly starts to return to normal (in about 20 mins). The urge to pass stool stopped. 12:22 No change either way- Breathing is ok, but mild tingling around lips, and feeling of tightness at back of throat. I take 5mg Cetrizine HCl.  [Note: My mouth and throat felt like I have felt in the past with a reaction to shellfish.] 1:15 Redness at back of throat is less, and I feel normal. I drive off the parking lot of the vaccination site Next day Throat feels sore, but otherwise ok

The reporter (friend of the patient) called to file a report for his friend, who did not speak any English. The reporter wanted to make Pfizer aware of the adverse event that the patient experienced. The reporter stated that the hospital staff stated that they reported the patient&#39;s adverse event to Pfizer, the local health department and the CDC, but the patient&#39;s family and friends were not sure if the report was filed, thus the reporter was calling. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;6-7 hours after getting home from getting the vaccine on 16Mar2021, the patient started to feel fever, pain in his back, and pain in his neck that went up to his head. The hospital had given the patient Tylenol and the hospital staff informed the patient that if he felt a fever or pain after the COVID-19 vaccine, he should take the Tylenol. The hospital staff also informed the patient that if his symptoms got worse to call 911 and go to the emergency room. The patient took the Tylenol and his fever came down a bit and the patient went to sleep. On the next day, 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s neck pain started going up more like a headache. On the morning of Thursday, 18Mar2021, the patient got weak. The patient could barely move his hand or neck or leg. After the weakness began, &#34;it was like 1-2-3&#34; and the patient was passed out.

The medical staff at the hospital did a lot of testing on the patient, MRIs and all that stuff, and all of the test results were coming back negative. The medical staff took some fluid from the patient&#39;s back after the patient was in the hospital for 2-3 days. The results came back negative until 2 weeks later when the patient&#39;s friends and family were informed that the patient had Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

The patient was also treated for high blood pressure for the first few days that he was hospitalized.

                                                I started getting a specific very unpleasant metallic smell (and to a lesser degree taste) to pistachios, peanut butter and to a lesser degree, almond butter. I also notice the same smell in my body odor and feces (which may be related to eating the above objects). These may be related in the sense that they are all dry roasted. I am an MD and have a PhD in immunology -I have looked at vaccine smell changes, and the best I can find is that changes in smell resolve after a few days. Mine has not diminished at all.

                                                I had right sided headache for the first two days, then resolved.  The right sided headaches recurred along with right tongue numbness initially on 12/29/2020.  The symptoms worsen on 12/31/2020 and severe on 1/1/2021.  I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

                                                Headache started later that day that never went away. It has been 2 weeks. It is a dull throbbing headache. My vision also got blurry.  I was told my cataract in my left eye (left arm was shot) had gotten just a little worse after seeing my ophthalmologist.  I also noticed the cataract originally appeared after using the scopolamine patch  (on my left side) a few years ago.  I don&#39;t know if there is a connection. Also, I was told the left eye has become very dry.  I also went to a retinologist, but said the retina seemed okay.

                                                In the past, I have had a very mild  and intermittent case of tinnitus.  However, immediately after receiving my first Pfizer dose -- within an hour -- I noticed that my tinnitus got much, much worse and louder -- it became a constant loud hissing in both ears.  More than a week later, the tinnitus is almost debilitating --  CONSTANT and never getting any lower.    A &#34;whooshing&#34; sound that just won&#39;t stop.  It&#39;s maddening.    I&#39;ve never had tinnitus this bad in my life and there is no reason for it to have gotten worse besides the vaccine.    It is high-pitched, and constant, and this is two weeks after receiving my dose.     It&#39;s only getting worse -- there has been no hint of quieting down.   I am very upset over this and it&#39;s obvious that my tinnitus got severe directly after I got the first Pfizer vaccine.   I&#39;ve been living at home alone for the last year so it&#39;s certainly not due to loud music or anything like that.

Since then the ringing has gotten quieter but yet still always there and has not gone away at any point.

He ate a ham sandwich and drank plenty of water prior to leaving the house.  He states he is often &#34;dehydrated &#34;because he works in a hot warehouse and sweats a lot on the job but had not begun working yet this evening.  He tries to drink lots of water and electrolyte drinks such as Pedialyte when he is at work.  Of note, he states his doctor was concerned recently because of some abnormal liver enzymes and mildly elevated blood glucose readings on routine lab work.

No treatment to date, just happened last couple of days. NOTE: I had a surgical procedure (to fix a hiatal hernia, laparoscopic procedure) on Monday 03/29.  Outpatient procedure but was under general anesthesia.  This procedure was done in a hospital 5 days post the first vaccine dose.

I was not under any stress, have never had anything like this occur, was not doing anything strenuous and all of a sudden had what I thought might even be a stroke or heart attack. I walked back to the house and took BP and it was 172/75 and pulse rate was only 64...but I was sweating, faint feeling, blurred vision, completely exhausted and it felt like my heart was pounding...but it wasn?t.??  I took BP multiple times but it was fine.  Just a really strange anxiety attack I guess that lasted a few hours.  I wasn?t worried about it and was t going to report it but have had 3 other people who unsolicited told me about their anxiety attack between 5 -7 days after shots. Two were phizer and one was Modena. Figured I would report it in case it helped someone else to not panic if they had an event like this.  It was quite scary and I don?t get worried about things like that!

A 48-year-old male patient (Height: 5&#39;10 (unit not probed further), Weight: 220 (unit not probed further)) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 48-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he took the vaccine on 09Mar2021 and immediately he got the same day, he got the severe tinnitus in his ears and he was six weeks out and this been a lot, reading about it now. But, the tinnitus was really not gone away, it&#39;s a whooshing sound, it&#39;s really miserable, it&#39;s turned up on the day he got the Pfizer vaccine. He saw his ear, nose and throat doctor. His ENT doctor advised him surprisingly based on these other patients that came with same symptoms as him advised to skip the second vaccine. Patient didn&#39;t really want to skip the second dose, but he was at the 42 days and he want to wait for his tinnitus to get lower before getting it. Patient don&#39;t know what to do if he waited had 42 days there was no research, he would still like could get it his ears heel or if the tinnitus got lower. Patient had the severe tinnitus from the day he got the vaccine and he was now getting the 42 days maximum gap between doses. The patient underwent lab test and procedure which included Audiology for his hearing, was the one to check for his lost hearing: tinnitus from the vaccine on 24Mar2021. No treatment was received for the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Ringing started in my left ear within 48 hours of 2nd vaccination shot (same side as injection arm).  The ringing has been persistent, continuous, and continues today, three and one half weeks after receiving the second dose.  The ringing has NOT been accompanied with other sinus related symptoms, like congestion, stuffy nose, etc.  I have experienced a mild plugged-ear like symptom in my right ear, but not ringing in the right ear.  This also persists today.  The intensity of the ringing in my left ear varies slightly from time to time, without any understood correlation.  The ringing intensity is high enough to impact my hearing of conversational speech, but not so severe to impact sleeping. Overall, the intensity of the ringing  has not diminished, and may even be increasing slightly.  I have not received any medical advice yet, but plan to make an appointment with my doctor as soon as possible.

A 48-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Manufacturer: Unspecified, Formulation: Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration to his left arm on 24May2021 (at age of vaccination) (Lot number: EW0191, NDC number/Expiry date: Unknown) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was taking Covid 19 shot as he was forced to do it or he would lose his job, against medical advice. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications were reported as none (other products: no). On an unspecified date in May2021, the patient experienced rash all over his arm and ringing of the ears, tinnitus. Caller stated he was a healthcare professional, he sold Medicare and other healthcare plans. He said he was calling about the shot. He did not get the information for reporting until he got the second shot today. Caller stated it said Pfizer EW0191 for the first shot and then PFIZER EW0196 for the second one. He was not sure if it was a zero or an O. He stated he was calling about the Covid 19. He wanted to report the first one and he had a sheet and he was reading all of things. He had a rash all over his arm and it was puffy. Not just a rash it exploded since then. They keep growing and then they dry off and come up again. Caller stated his first shot was done on 24May2021. He did not know he lost a lot a weight he was 175. Caller clarified the weight loss if from his treatments. He had a rash all over his arm. He could not tell if it was the first or second day. Either 24May2021 or 25May2021. He woke up with it. Then he did not realize until the next day until midday. It was probably sometime at night. It was ongoing and persisting. It was not getting worse, well actually now it on the right just a few. It said CDC Covid 19 vaccination on a 2x3 card. He got his first shot on his left and the second on his right. Ringing of the ears, tinnitus. That night he experienced it and it had not stopped. It was not loud or making him mad or crazy but he was hearing it. Attempted to clarify with caller the start date. Caller stated that night or the next. It was ongoing and persisting. It was a low tone, still there. He guesses it helps the more adverse events that are reported when people call in with adverse events. Now if he were to call now that he got the second shot to report more rashes, he already had a rash on each arm. Treatment was reported as none. Treatment included acne, benzoyl peroxide to dry it up. Communication: Provided caller with Report Reference 7OUJST6G. Outcome of the event weight loss was unknown, whereas other events was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Tuesday evening, my wife noticed that I am not fully blinking/closing my right eye; Feb 17, 2021 Wednesday, I didn&#39;t have the same pain but there&#39;s numbness on my right cheek extending to my right lips.  Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

                                                A few days after the shot I experienced persistent swelling and pain in the hard palate directly behind the incisors, extending back about an inch. It was as if I&#39;d burned my mouth with hot coffee. Pain was intense enough to wake me at night and make eating solid food difficult. I had to use topical benzocaine to get through meals.   The episode lasted a full week before subsiding.

Things I loved before the vaccine I can no longer tolerate because they taste so bad. I am eating ice so I don&#39;t dehydrate.  This is the worst experience I have ever had and I doubt that I will get the second dose.

Moments later, heart rate elevated north of 190 bpm and blood pressure went up to approx 180/100. Developed dry mouth (was very thirsty) and shaking/chills. Took about 60 minutes to stabilize. Went to ER for evaluation and tests around 2:30P. Received a liter of fluid. Both EKG and Bloodwork was indicated as normal. Released from hospital around 6P. Slept through most of the night.   3/26: heart rate was erratic all day. Would race and then stabilize throughout the day/night. Extremely lethargic. No trouble breathing (was able to breathe and take deep breathes) but took effort to breathe.  3/27: 1:40A woke up heart began racing at close to 200 bpm. Dry mouth, shakes. Similar to what I experienced immediately following the vaccine shot. Went to ER out of precaution. Symptoms stabilized after about an hour. Hospital did EKG, blood work and chest X-ray. all were normal, lungs were clear. However, glucose and bilirubin were both slightly elevated.  3/29: Still feeling lethargic. Heart rate has stabilized some but is still erratic. It  easily increases from simply walking around the house (much more than usual).   3/30: Scheduled appointment with primary care physician 3/31: Scheduled appointment with cardialogist

A 49-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Mar2021 14:40 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included he had some previous nerve damage in his neck that had not been acting up in about a year. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL9269) on 02Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. On 24Mar2021, patient had some facial numbness and mild palsy in the left side of the face. He stated he had some previous nerve damage in his neck that had not been acting up in about a year, but it was acting up then. He stated it was the feeling like when you go to sleep on something, and it felt heavier. He asked what he should do, if he should seek medical attention and for information on this. After providing information from the Prescribing information, he asked if the Bell&#39;s Palsy went away in these individuals in the clinical trials? He stated his wife just said that the left side of his face was sagging. He stated he did not think it was a stroke though because he could move that side of his face and can articulate everything. He felt loopy but did not feel like it was a stroke. Patient reported that basically he felt numbness on the side of his face and cheek. There were reactions when he smiled, it seemed a little bit off. There was a weird feeling and numbness in his face. The numbness went from his cheek up on to the temple area and jaw area, the numbness was primarily on the left side of his face. Patient had nerve damage in his neck already. Patient wanted to know if he should go somewhere with it, was it ok, what was going on with the numbness in his face. Patient thought the numbness in his face and cheek had worsened. Felt like face was heavy on that side or drooping:  Caller reported that looking in mirror, the left side of his face did not react the same. Patient&#39;s face felt like it was heavy or drooping on the left side, but that it pulls up higher. Patient reported that his face looked ok. Mouth pulls weird: Patient reported that this could be from his prior nerve damage, it was like he had got some weird palsy going on in his face. Patient stated that he just wanted someone to tell him dude wait it out, go to the emergency room, go to the doctor. Patient inquired if the facial numbness was because he had prior nerve condition and if the Covid-19 vaccine had exacerbated his existing nerve condition. The outcome of the events were unknown.

                                                I went with my wife, whom we were more concerned about possible reactions to the vaccine given her history of anaphylaxis reactions to bee and wasp stings, has had to carry a Epi-pen always, so we stayed an additional 15 minutes for 30 minutes total before we left.  She was completely fine throughout, I however as we were walking out I began to feel a little ?Off?, not necessarily nauseous or dizzy, just a bit Off.  Told my wife that and that I wasn?t sure I should drive us home (I drove us there), so she drove.  About 15-20 minutes into the drive, it got worse and I passed out.  My wife says my eyes rolled in the back of my head with my eyes open but no responsive.  She says she kept hitting my chest but I didn?t respond. I came to about 2 minutes after passing out.  She asked me if I felt like I needed to goto the hospital, I told her I needed to eat, that I felt like what I needed was food, then we go from there.  I did eat breakfast, an English muffin at about 8am that morning, it was almost 12:30 by that point.  When I finally got food in me I felt much better and have had no adverse reactions since.

I started with severe vertigo and left ear pressure on 4-3-21. I have never had this problem in my life. I was okay by 4-5-21, and I though everything was fine. On 4-15-21, the severe ear pressure in my left ear returned along with the severe vertigo. I have now had 24-7 vertigo daily since 4-15-21. I went to my family doctor, on 4-16-21. I was given meclazine which has done absolutely nothing. I feel absolutely awful, and it is at its worse after 6 pm. I can not live like this. Daily activities are an absolute chore now.

A  male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 31Mar2021 at 18:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; expiration date not reported) at the age of  at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Medical history included diabetic from 2006 and ongoing; heart patient, had first heart attack in 2006; kidney stones, diagnosed during end of last year 2020 or beginning of this year 2021. Patient had his 1st car accident when he was . Family medical history relevant to adverse events was reported as none. There is no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, no additional vaccines administered on same date, no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the vaccine and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he got the COVID vaccine at the end of the last month, the 30Mar2021 or 31 Mar2021. Patient then confirmed it was 31Mar2021. Patient stated that he is diabetic and a heart patient. He has been having kidney stones that has nothing to do with vaccine. He was supposed to have a procedure for the kidney stones done yesterday, 13Apr2021. He drank a lot of water 3 days before but when he went in yesterday, 13Apr2021, they couldn&#39;t find a vein and usually he does not have trouble with people finding a vein. They did try to go in his neck a couple of times to place an IV and he did end up with a knot in his face. They couldn&#39;t find a vein that would hold an IV, so he was not able to have the procedure done. Patient reported that the knot was just a little knot on the jaw below the ear lobe, and so he went home but it kept getting bigger and hurting a lot more. He reported that the knot is now all the way to the center of his nose, his eyeball and bone around the eyeball hurts. The patient&#39;s jawbone hurts, inner ear and outer ear hurts all the way down to neck and shoulder. He went back to the surgical center yesterday, 13Apr2021, they told him there was no bleeding and that he could go home or do whatever he wanted to do. Patient stated that he ended up in emergency room on 13Apr2021. He reported that the emergency room ran some bloodwork but doesn&#39;t know what kind and that they had to stick him 4 or 5 times and then had to use a sonogram machine to find a vein. He stated that he was stuck 20 times yesterday trying to get blood and find a vein. He stated that finding a vein on him has never been that hard and that he does have tricky veins sometimes, but if someone is good enough, they can get it. Patient reported that the emergency room basically did a CAT or CT scan, it wasn&#39;t an MRI, but he thinks it was a CAT scan with contrast. He stated that the emergency room didn&#39;t find anything and that they told him it was his imagination but that it is not his imagination to see a knot on the side of his face. Patient stated that he could be wrong, but he thinks it is because of the COVID vaccine. He stated that he has had needles, surgeries, IVs before and never had this where they can&#39;t get a vein and have never had knots just pop up on his body. Patient commented he has days when he can&#39;t hear, clarified as selective hearing since an unknown date. Patient stated that he will not be getting that second COVID vaccine. He stated that last month he had no problems with his veins, so the only thing new since last month is the COVID vaccine he received on 31Mar2021. He stated that he thinks he received the COVID vaccine on the left side but everything he is experiencing is on the right side. Patient reported that trouble finding veins started at 7:00 AM, the knot showed up around 8:00 AM or 8:30 AM and that he has a headache that started on 13Apr2021, around 8:00 AM or 8:30 AM that is ongoing and staying about the same as a constant headache. Patient stated that he was told that the hospital isn&#39;t for what he has. The outcome of the events knot on face and headache was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

I had not been straining or doing any activity that I believe would have facilitated this type of event.

                                                36 hours after vaccination, I woke up at 3am with ringing in both ears for the first time in my life.  I&#39;ve seen two ENTs and a chiropractor. My hearing test was normal and showed no loss of hearing. The ENT said the pressure test was normal.  I have had periods of ear pressure, clogging and the feeling of water in the ears.  Over the past 10 weeks, those specific symptoms have diminished and only now happen a few times a week, but the ringing in the ears persists.  It is constant.  I have gotten more used to it, and there are times when it&#39;s louder and times when it&#39;s less loud, but I cannot say that it is &#34;disappearing&#34;.  The ringing is definitively not resolved.  I have tried prescription nasal spray and allegra, which possibly help. In addition, 13 days after vaccination, I started experience chest tightness, sternum pain, aches and pains throughout my upper body: both arms, back.  The tightness in the chest is exacerbated by exercise. Those symptoms have diminished over time but have not resolved. I have not gone back to exercise. Chest xray was negative and stress test was normal. Transthoracic Echo showed some abnormalities. Blood pressure became elevated post vaccination and remains elevated.

I fell at work when I was just standing by my desk when I suddenly became extremely dizzy. At home I am having to hold onto things to help with balance. I am also having headaches, tinnitus, confusion, some mild congestion, and extreme tiredness. The vaccine is the only thing thing that is different the last couple of months. None of my medications have changed. I am due for the second shot next week, but I am not getting it due to the side effects I am experiencing.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

                                                diarrhea worsened 2 hours after receiving the vaccine; Ringing in my ear; was already having a flare; Hearing loss was already there and the vaccine actually exacerbated the situation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot EN6201, first dose) solution for injection intramuscular in the right arm on 24Feb2021 at 17:00 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing irritable bowel syndrome from Mar2020 and acid reflux (esophageal). Concomitant medication included ongoing lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux (esophageal) from Nov2020. The patient stated his diarrhea worsened 2 hours after receiving the vaccine (24Feb2021 at 19:00) and had diarrhea again around 10 pm. The patient stated hearing loss was already there and the vaccine actually exacerbated the situation in 2021. The patient also experienced ringing in my ear in 2021.

Treatment for the event hearing loss exacerbated included unspecified steroids and has been working. The outcome of the events diarrhea worsened and ringing in my ear was unknown. The outcome of the events hearing loss exacerbated and having a flare was recovering.

                                                About 6.5 hours after vaccination my throat got a bit dry and feeling like a start of a cold /raspy feeling and I felt two spots on the front of my neck itching. I looked in mirror and saw two pimple size type spots itchy. over the neck 30 mins another itchy pimple grew and neck got a bit red  and under an ear got red and itchy.   over the next hour my breathing felt a little more difficult, though oxygen level oximeter reading still good.  8.5 hours after vaccination both sides of my upper back/shoulders were covered in hives.  I felt a bit foggy also.  I administered epinephrine pen to my thigh.  Over next few minutes the hives disappeared (except for a few pimple size spots though they basically disappeared)and the itch was gone.   My breathing felt fine.  I monitored signs and symptoms with no noticeable issues for the next day&#43;.  This was the 1st time I ever used an epi pen.

I got in my house and told my wife I was not feeling right and started to notice a dizziness coming on. I was to call the pharmacy to find out what I should do, but noticed my heart rate was up, I looked at my Apple watch monitor and my BPM was 164. I felt flush and told my wife to call 911. Ambulance arrived and took my vitals and ( I do not recall the blood pressure, but it was high for me) when they put me into the ambulance I began to shake uncontrollably and then began to sweat profusely. They took me to the emergency room, but did not administer any drugs. The Dr. came in and said he did not think it was related to the vaccine, but my personal Dr. agreed with me based on my medical history that it had to be related to the vaccine. My resting heart rate (I monitor this daily) is between 45 - 60 and my last blood pressure reading at my yearly physical on April 2nd, 2021 was 100/70.

Has been 3&#43; weeks since 1st shot and tinnitus has not gotten better.  I would rate the tinnitus as &#34;moderate&#34;.  It is definitely noticeable, high-pitched ringing in both ears.  Not debilitating but definitely present.  I am scheduled for my second shot next week but will likely not get it, for fear of making the tinnitus worse than it already is.  I can barely put up with it now, if it gets any worse after the 2nd dose I will greatly regret getting the 2nd dose, so I am likely to skip it.

Symptoms tapered off over 3-5 days. Similar experience with 2nd vaccine but less pronounced with a shorter timeframe, tapering off after 2-3 days. Strongest side effects after first vaccine, symptoms did not become noticeable until a couple of hours after it was administered, increasing next 24 hours before lessening over time. Basically identical to long covid symptoms but lasting only for a few days after vaccinations and not before.

                                                On April 1, 2021, I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Center and the only side effect from the vaccine at that time was localized soreness at the injection site of my left shoulder.   On April 2, 2021, earlier that day the soreness at the injection site began to dissipate after doing push-ups and massaging my left arm. After going to bed last night and that night is when the additional side effects started.  I was awakened by itching on both arms which had formed whelps from my shoulder to my forearm.   For the next 13 days, the whelps and itching were sparsely during the day (which had consumed my legs, upper torso as well as arms) as they presented the illusion to be getting better but would flare up at night while sleeping. I attempted to do home remedies from Calamine lotion, Benadryl and cold showers but nothing seemed to effectively work against the itching and the whelps that resembled Hives.    On April 13, 2021, while at work a new side affect began which was the swelling of my bottom lip (particularly the right half) along with itching in my throat.  The swelling reduced itself as I continued to work through the night but the discomfort in my throat continued. The whelps and itching were still sparsely present as well.   On April 14, 2021, later that morning, post work, the reduced swelling of my lower lip and throat discomfort I decided to go to the ER. While enroute to the ER, my top lip began to tingle and swell. These events made me more concerned about the severity I was experiencing since receiving the vaccine.   After checking into the ER and being triaged, the doctor informed me that I would be hospitalized overnight due to the swelling of my upper lip, elongated tonsils, elevated blood pressure and the diagnosis of whelps as Hives. For the next three nights I was intravenous administered Epinephrine, Benadryl and Prednisone.   On April 16, 2021, the third night I was discharged from the hospital with the same medications and informed to follow up with an allergist.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 50-year-old, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 25Mar2021 19:00 (Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to spring pollen, oak birch, and ash. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) and levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken as allergy medication. On 25Mar2021, the patient got the shot, waited 15 minutes, no problems. On 26Mar2021, woke up to a very very red face. On 27Mar2021, massive facial angioedema, fatigue, itching, notable penis redness, his penis was also &#34;sheet red&#34; and swollen. The patient started 4mg prednisolone on 27Mar2021, kept facial swelling and allergies at bay, mostly, but a very close rate to not keeping up. On 02Apr2021, swelling subsided and mostly was getting back to &#34;normal&#34;, however lips were flaking, skin flaking. On 04Apr2021-week of, things got better, very swollen lips but everything reasonably in check. On 12Apr2021, the face re-firing red at approx 1pm, slept until 6pm, and complete relapse of allergy/angioedema. Trip to Emergency room (ER), given shot of Kenelog in the arm, released. On 13Apr2021, no improvement, steroids ended 6 days after the patient started taking them, 2nd trip to ER with epinephrine shot, no improvement; blood taken, white blood cell count normal. On 14Apr2021, allergist appointment and he was told that he was allergic to something in the shot triggers pollen allergies, rosacea, etc. 50mg prednisone 5 days, 40mg 5 days, etc. He states that it was a systemic histamine reaction. On 26Apr2021 starts up again, mild, contact me. The patient doesn&#39;t know what to do with the second vaccine in general and he had called and they say no on him getting number 2. He was terrified of vaccines now because of his reaction. He also says that he was not hospitalized but he went to the emergency room twice. The patient would like to know if there have been any reports of those who had a similar reaction to this getting the second dose of the vaccine and how they reacted. He states that he has been told that he should not get the second dose but wonders if he were to get another COVID-19 vaccine other than Pfizer, if he would have the same reaction. The event allergic to something in the shot/systemic histamine reaction resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The event massive facial angioedema/ complete relapse of allergy/angioedema resulted to emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with steroids for the events. The outcome of the event massive facial angioedema/complete relapse of allergy/angioedema was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovering.

                                                He got his vaccine, he felt tiredness but nothing major.  The next day he started feeling nauseous and really out of strength.  His muscles were tired, and he got a strange bump under his right armpit, and had a mild fever.  He also had little bumps around the vaccine site.  The arm is red, but not itchy but does hurt upon touching the arm.   It&#39;s beginning to get better.  He did run fever, and had fever blisters in his mouth that are still there, and he has a lot of pain on the right arm, and on the shoulder blade area.  He has taken Ibuprofen for these symptoms.  He did not call his doctor.

This was followed by 2 weeks of regular PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s noted by my self. This did not seem to be related to any kind of anxiety since I have never had anxiety problems.   I eventually had an echo cardiogram on  03/30/2021 which resulted as normal I also wore a Ziopatch for 2 weeks from 03/30/2021 which resulted as normal. By the time I was able to be tested most of my symptoms had resolved.

I don&#39;t remember exactly when but it was it was very noticeable the following day after receiving the first shot (and very possibly that night) and continued to worsen for the next few days. I&#39;ve have very mild tinnitus most of my life, however this is *far* worse than anything I have ever experienced (can hear it very clearly over day-time background noise, conversations, etc. whereas before could only hear it when it was relatively quiet.) It has been 3 weeks and has not abated, and in fact is probably continuing to grow worse. It is probably noteworthy that within minutes of receiving the shot, a got quite light headed and my face felt slightly numb for a period of an hour or two. These symptoms went away, however the tinnitus has not.

This tinnitus was so loud and overbearing that I was forced to turn on the television to ?mask? the ringing in order to go back to sleep. This only started after my 2nd dose and has continued ever since (it?s been 5 days now) without any signs of improvement. I have no history of tinnitus, nor have I ever been infected with Covid 19.

A 50-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EM9810, Expiration date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered at an unspecified anatomical location on 10Feb2021 at 09:00 am (age at vaccination was 50 years) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient had known allergies to iodine, shrimp and iodide (like the CATSCAN contrast fluid). Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and One-A-Day Mens over 50 vitamin. The patient previously received first dose of flu shot in upper right arm on 12Jan2021. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Hospital. On 10Feb2021 at 15:00 pm, the patient experienced swelling of tongue, face, confusion, slurry words, difficulty breathing, no pains though, headache (bad one) and numbness in right side. The patient received treatment with DECADRON (steroid) and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent Nasal Swab COVID test (COVID Nasal/Nasopharynx COVID test) on 28Feb2021 and the result was negative. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unknown date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events.

                                                11 minutes after vaccine administration I began experiencing prickling sensation of mouth lips followed by prickling sensation of my tongue, increased heart rate and for a few seconds felt my throat tightening.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes.  By the time I was evaluated at the emergency department a few minutes later I was feeling much better.  I did not need to take any medications.  7 hours later I began experiencing itching all over my body however, I never developed a rash.  My heart rate slightly increased.  Simply did not feel well.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes and again resolved without having to take any medications.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

ANA titer was 1:40 with speckled and cytoplasma pattern.   My last ANA was negative when tested for inflammation due to back pain few years prior.     Neurologist  did not think this was an allergic reaction and since symptoms were gradually improving recommended second dose.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test.

He did also say that he was having vomiting but that had been after taking his antibiotic and medications for the shingles, basically his right side of his body.

Took solu-medrol dose pack and abdominal pain symptoms  improved, but still not fully resolved.   On Feb 16 was seen by PCP for persisting, unilateral tinnitus.   Sent for MRI Brain which was normal .   Referred  for further evaluation by audiologist and otolaryngologist .  Was seen on  February 25, 2021 for right ear fullness, tinnitus.    Hearing test normal.   Diagnosed with right sided tinnitus.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: En6200), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Feb2021 12:00 (at the age of 51-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine facility type was a school or student health clinic. Medical history included heart attack in Oct2020. The patient had no known allergies. The patient did not have covid prior vaccination and was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin; clopidogrel and metoprolol. It was reported that on 18Feb2021 (the day after the patient got the covid shot) at approximately 17:00 his ears started ringing, he called in sick and got a doctor&#39;s appointment asap. The patient said that there was no blockage or infection, so he got a referral to an audiologist to get hearing test. The test only revealed some amount of loss due to the ringing he wasn&#39;t able to hear high frequency at low volumes. The patient was concerned about getting second shot. Not sure what to do. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and was considered disability or permanent damage. There was no treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 08:48 am (lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included facial paralysis from 20Jan2021 to an unknown date diagnosed initially as bell&#39;s palsy but now is diagnosed as myasthenia gravis and gastric reflux. Concomitant medication included unspecified gastric reflux medication and unspecified vitamins. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior and did not receive other vaccine on the same day. The patient previously he was put on prednisone 60 mg tablets by mouth times 7 days, then 10 mg tablets for an additional 7 days. The patient mentioned he received the vaccine in a vaccination center. The patient reported that prior to his first shot towards the end of Jan2021, his doctor thought he had Bell&#39;s Palsy. On 20Jan2021, he stated that he was put on a high dose of steroids to clear it up. He stated that on 09Mar2021, he had his first Covid vaccine with no issues. On 12Mar2021 between 5-6 pm, he mentioned that it came back (the Bell&#39;s Palsy) with a vengeance, near his eye and with eye droop. He specifies left eye droop. He added that the Monday after (15Mar2021) over the weekend, it got worse. He mentioned that he talked with his neurologist who told him to speak with his ophthalmologist who the patient spoke to on Tuesday. The patient mentioned that both doctors came up with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. He inquired since one of his doctor&#39;s is concerned about him taking the second vaccine and the other doctor was ok with it. He mentioned that one doctor had a feeling of some bias, and the other doctor. He did some research in an association with people diagnosed with it. One of his doctors said that he is immunocompromised, so he looked at autoimmune information, and the information says it is ok. He reached out to the local medical center that is doing the vaccination and they are unwilling to talk with him over the phone. He has read on the association site and they seem to recommend to take it. He did not want to rebel against his doctor, so he wants to be sure. He inquired if it was safe for him to take his second dose and wanted to get good factual information that can give him a good starting point that is related. He mentioned that his second dose schedule was on 30Mar2021. He also stated that initial onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy with left eye droop, he was on a high dose steroid regimen and that seem to help which he finished up early Feb2021. It was mentioned that the event initial onset was not after the vaccine. The Ophthalmologist checked him on Tuesday and his left eye which he could barely open, and his doctor also noticed right eye droop. He stated without medication, it is worsening but with his medication, it is definitely helping to transmit between nerves. He stated before the medication this time of day he could not lift his left eye longer throughout the day, the more difficult it is for the muscles as they become weaker. There was noticeably drooping of the right eye. The ophthalmologist exam on his right eye was drooping which was ongoing. It is still there, his wife and he were comparing their eyes and how much he could open it, and it surprised them how little he could open it. It was different and strange. The time reported for the drooping of the right eye was 2:30 pm and persisting but the left eye was worse. He hasn&#39;t noticed a difference about the same, medication has been helping. It was also mentioned that myasthenia gravis reported that it started on the 16Mar2021 2:30 pm (talked to the Neurologist to compare notes, so maybe 3:30 - 4:00) when they made the initial diagnosis and started testing the next day. He is waiting for blood work to come back, but all the tests have pointed in that direction. Myasthenia gravis was ongoing, but the condition has worsened and the medications at a therapeutic level, it keeps it at bay. He further added that his eye became so hard to see, so he pyridostigmine bromide on 17Mar2021 since he couldn&#39;t open or focus, he thought he would give it a try. It works when he can&#39;t focus and if he doesn&#39;t take, it he will go back to where he was before. He will not be able to open his eye and the double vision will come back. The events required physician&#39;s office visit but did not require emergency room visit. He mentioned that there were 3 test and one more scheduled. The first one was a common test; the first initial test diagnose Myasthenia gravis. The second test was the ice test since they went on the assumption in their initial thinking it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and in his, doctor&#39;s, opinion it didn&#39;t look right. The test sounds goofy and it is one of the tests, they did to predict how it was going to go. He reported that they placed an ice cube in a cloth on the eye and let cool for 2-3 minutes. The eye lid is raised more than it was before the test and it went back down. This test was done on 16Mar2021. He reported that the did a chest x-ray on 17Mar2021 and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal. He has a CT scheduled next Wednesday (24Mar2021) to check his thalamus and lungs. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test with unknown results on 17Mar2021, he reported that he is waiting for the results to look for antibodies for Myasthenia gravis; chest x-ray was normal on 17Mar2021, he reported that they did a chest x-ray and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal; endoscopy with results of no finding on Mar2021, his GI doctor wanted to do an upper and lower endoscopy, so 2 weeks prior to the vaccine he had an upper and lower endoscopy with no finding; and ice test with results of bell&#39;s palsy on 16Mar2021 and in his doctor&#39;s opinion, it didn&#39;t look right. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Hives with itch appeared about 3 hours after the shot was given, along with an itchy feeling in mouth and on tongue and feeling of strangeness in throat. I felt mostly normal during the 30 minutes after the shot, but developed a headache, chills, mildly upset stomach. I have anxiety issues and was nervous about getting shot so was hesitant to label anything as a side effect as it could be anxiety/panic disorder etc. But the rash/hives are itchy - I showered which made them itchier. I&#39;m submitting this @ 10:30pm EST, my shot was @ 2pm EST - I have taken more zyrtec worried I am having an allergic reaction. I am filing this because I am worried about the 2nd shot - I do not want to have  a worse allergic reaction after the 2nd shot. I will call my allergist. He manages my allergies and advised me to continue taking my seasonal allergy meds and zyrtec as normal during the shot today. Presently there are no hives/itch on any other parts of my body except my upper chest and upper back.

                                                I got the vaccine on Tuesday morning. On Thursday morning when I woke up, the skin around my left eye was red (like in a rash) and the eye was swollen. By Friday morning, my other eye was swollen as well and I developed a rash on my upper right chest (very close to the collar bone). By Saturday morning, my symptoms had worsened slightly. I went to urgent care to see a doctor at 1 PM. They were not sure if this was a reaction to the vaccine. They asked me if I had exposure to poison oak, I didn&#39;t (although I do have severe allergy to poison oak). They recommended taking Allegra 180mg twice a day. Doctor recommended taking the second dose of the vaccine per plan on 4/20 but starting Allegra 1 day before that and continue to take it until 3 days later. I have occasional itching but no pain.

                                                Roughly 11 hours after the injection, 75% of my body was covered in hives.  I was very itchy and red.  The next day I did a televisit through my health insurance provider&#39;s website and saw a medical professional who advise that I treat the hives with OTC drugs like Benedryl &amp; Pepcid.  I also used topical creams like Cortisone &amp; Gold Bond.  I soaked in a bath with an oatmeal powder.  Also used an ice pack.  I got very little temporary relief from these treatments.  The medical profession said to not use a steroid as no one is sure what that could do to the effectiveness of the vaccine.  This has gone on now for over three full days now and I&#39;m following up with my regular medical practice today.  The affected areas (most of my body) look slightly better today but I&#39;m still just as itchy.  In addition, my top lip was slightly swollen when I woke up today but has since gone down.  I haven&#39;t had any respiratory issues.

Also noticed the day after both shots I was highly sensitive to the sun  and my forehead got discolored blotchy red/brown (similar to a bad sunburn but without the pain) that took a day to mostly go away, but still has hints of it.   Cold sore is subsiding but expect it to last at least a week. Haven?t had them in a long time, but recognize it.

                                                Received the shot around 10:15 am on 30 April 2021 at a public vaccination clinic at a community center.  I didn&#39;t expect any side effects as no one I know has had any from the first shot.  However, within about 2-3 hours started to feel mild body aches similar to when you have the flu coming on and minor fatigue.  Nothing debilitating.  Ended up taking a few long naps during the day and not getting much work done.  By the evening I had a very slight headache at the base of my neck which was probably related to the sore muscles.  Also noticed that the soles of my feet were a little sore which seemed unusual.  Went to bed around 11:30 pm on 30 April.  Woke up around 3 am on 1 May and just felt &#34;off.&#34;  I could still feel body soreness but also had developed a strong metallic taste at the back of my mouth and into my throat.  Drank a lot of water to try to see if that changed anything but it didn&#39;t.    Woke up around 7 am on 1 May.  Body was very sore (like from a major workout), bottoms of feet still tender, minor headache and strong metallic taste.  Tried to work on some things but ended up going back to bed around 8 am for a few hours.  Woke up around 10 am and feel much better.  Minor body aches (including the sore feet, which is weird) and just a minimal metallic taste.

                                                Ringing in ears/Tinnitus; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 23Mar2021 (at age of 51 years old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included did had surgery a month before and did had a bunch of lab work to get to that. Concomitant medication(s) included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), zolpidem. The patient experienced Ringing in ears, Nausea, Tinnitus, all on 13Apr2021. First dose was 23Mar2021; second dose scheduled for 14Apr2021. May delay or not get second dose. Caller states he got his first shot on 23Mar2021 (three weeks before) and is scheduled for his second shot today (14Apr2021). Says that yesterday (13Apr2021) he began experiencing ringing in his ears and nausea. States he looked online and saw that other people were also experiencing tinnitus and that it got worse after the second shot. Says some of them had said it got so bad they could not sleep or hear. He is worried about getting his second shot today and is asking if he should possibly delay it, or not get it? Patient took first vaccine 3 weeks before today and patient was due for the second vaccine today and patient started developing some ringing in ear a couple days before and patient didn&#39;t really think about much of it and so patient heard of few other people mentioned the same thing so patient was reading about it and hear that it is you know a side effect that people are experiencing. Patient just want to know if patient should not take the second dose that is scheduled for today or not, people like online people are saying the second dose made it much worse and people had severe ringing to the point where it affected their hearing and they couldn&#39;t sleep and it got along after their second dose, and that&#39;s what patient was about to go get today so patient want to know if patient should not take the second dose?&#34;. The outcome of the events was unknown. No Treatment in response to events.

The flu symptoms passed, but continued to have problems with lymph nodes. Fatigue set in just after flu symptoms, have never recovered. In June, I started having pain in my upper maxillary. Saw my dentist, who sent me to a dental surgeon. They determined that it was wire from a jaw surgery 30 years ago. They removed the wire, but all of the other wires are giving me pain, and may need to be removed. They had not bothered me prior to the vaccine. Mental health has also declined and not recovered. My medications are now higher than pre vaccine. Fatigue is still a major problem.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included hypertension, high blood cholesterol from unknown dates. Allergy information was not provided.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility.  Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), fenofibric acid (FENOFIBRIC ACID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive. Treatment for the events was reported as Motrin and Tylenol for fever and Delsym. for cough. The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

I did get shot series on 12/22/2020 #1 and 1/10/2021 and was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 12/13/2020.  My internist MD did not feel the vaccine caused the thrombus /Stroke but I wanted to report it as it was associated with the vaccine administration (symptoms of vision loss within 24 hours of the vaccine #2 administration).

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

Duration of about an hour after washing face and flushing eyes with warm tap water. Rinsed mouth with antiseptic and drank plenty of water. Things I know to do when anything I&#39;ve ingested sparks the warning signs with the tearing up of the left eye.

                                                I have had mild tinnitus (ear buzz) in my left ear from 2014. The onset of that had coincided with a flu shot I had taken then on the left arm. Since then the tinnitus had subsided to a tolerable level. I took the Pfizer Covid 1st shot on the right arm on 04/07/2021 9am. Other then mild fatigue, I was fine through the day. But that night at 3am, I woke up with significant tinnitus in my right ear. Over the next day it went away from the right ear but the tinnitus still lingered overall and was a little aggravated. Since then, it has now settled back in the left year but still at the aggravated levels it was back in 2014. Also, the left ear feels stuffed up as do my sinuses.

The ear speciaiist simply  advised me to either puchase hearing aides or download some white noise apps to play overnight.    there was no advice or insight as to how the vaccine did this to me.

The next morning he woke up with dizziness, headache and vision/near sighedness was impaired.  He has some emotional issues that have been corrected but they seemed to have returned.  Also had fatigue that was fairly  mild at first, and over the next 3 days got worse, and has remained the same since that time to present.   About a week some of the dizziness and headaches are not as often, but the headaches have become more severe.  Before it was a low grade migraine that was constant, but other times it is horrific and others not too bad.  No predictability.  No fever, no chills, no sore injection site.  He has notified his doctor who tested his electrolytes which came back normal.  He ended up falling getting out of the shower and hurt his back and shoulder and prescribed him Hydrocodone which did not help the headache.

It fades quite a bit sometimes, but is way more noticeable than ever before. I am thinking it may be related to the vaccine as nothing else in my diet/routine has changed recently and I feel great otherwise.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

Once or twice a day when I stand up I get dizzy or wobbly feeling, sometimes it is bad enough I have to sit back down. I no longer sleep well. I used to just lay in one spot all night, barely making a dent in the covers. My dog slept in bed every night for over 7 years. But after vax, she stopped sleeping on bed and I wake up to a trashed bed and the covers all balled up on my head. How or what I eat has changed, I no longer like most of the stuff I always liked. I no longer feel right, just always feel off, tired and by the end of most days the noise in my ear is driving me insane. I have never experienced the ear noise or the getting dizzy ever in my entire life until the Govt stuck poison in my arm.

This was before I knew of any reported instances of tinnitus associated with the vaccine.  My neighbor had mentioned he developed it after his.  I closely watched mine to see if it went away.    I am reporting now in June of 2021 because it has not gone away and this data may be valuable.  I am not sure if it is vaccine related or not.  I teach science.   I think logically not irrationally.   All I know is I seemed to have have noticeable tinnitus for the first time in my life around the time I received the vaccine.   I will eventually follow up with an audiologist in the near future.  Submitting this report is my first action concerning this situation.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I had the soreness in my arm and a small  fever of 99. Over the course of the next few weeks I was experiencing severe eye pain which caused me to start losing site in my right eye and also microclots in my eyes, my eye doctor stated that the vaccine was not the cause of my conditions with my eye.  But other than the soreness of my arm where the vaccine was administered and a slight fever I really didn&#39;t have any other problems.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 52-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 30Mar2021 03:00 PM (at the age of 52-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included hepatitis, hemochromatosis, high blood pressure, known allergy to nickel. No COVID prior vaccination was reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included losartan, from unspecified date at 50 mg, daily. No other vaccine was received four weeks. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and she experienced allergy. Patient reported that he received the Pfizer vaccine and he was involved in a vaccine clinic where they made some mistakes. He might or might not have received the first vaccine. They were not sure. They did not think he did. They scheduled me for 3 weeks in case he did get the vaccine. They think he might have gotten just saline solution instead of the vaccine. He knew Pfizer was doing testing on receiving a third dose instead of just two doses. Patient asked information on receiving a third dose. It was also reported that on 31Mar2021 12:00 PM the patient was suffering from weird smells that were not actually there, kind of bitter and sulfur like. It was very strong. Please note, he never actually had COVID. No treatment was received due to the event &#34;smell alteration&#34;. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not resolved for &#34;smell alteration&#34; and unknown for the other event.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Lasted 90-120 minutes before going to sleep, then gone by morning.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

                                                Chronic tinnitus significantly increased in intensity/volume the day following the first injection--I estimate about double the volume. In both ears. After 12 days it has not subsided at all. The increase in severity is causing secondary headache, jaw clenching, sleeplessness, irritability, hearing issues.

The next night after eating Tuna I had the tongue swelling again with some Tachycardia and a severe headache with red welts all over my body. I also had tightness in my throat. I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours. I took Prednisone for five days.

The next day (3/7) the right side of my face was numb and showing symptoms of what doctors later decided was Bells Palsy. on 3/7 I had fatigue and general feeling bad like I had the flu. On Monday 3/8, I was feeling worse and I called the advice nurse who advised I go to the  Emergency room due to right face partial paralysis, numbness, and face drooping. They diagnosed Bells Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and prednosone. From 3/9-12 the right side of my face was numb, droopy and I had ear pain and a lot of fatigue. By Saturday 3/13 I was feeling better and have gradually gotten better through today 3/26. I still have numbness in my right cheek. and occasional tingling in my lips. My doctor has advised me to go ahead and get the second dose of vaccine tomorrow 3/27. Also, during the week of 3/7 - 3/12 I had some dizziness and a general foggy feeling in my head.

                                                Worsening of tinnitus. Already had mild case with a high pitched sound in both ears, but mostly my left. About a day or so after 1st phizer shot the volume and intenity of tinnitus increased. Also added a lower octave static like sound in left ear that was not there before.  My 1st shot was March 17 about 9:30 am. My ears still ring almost 2 1/2 weeks now with the increased intensity. Afraid to get second shot, which I am supposed to get on Wed Apr 7.

Around 12 PM April 1st I noticed a distinct increase in the sound level of the tinnitus which has continued since.  I contacted my personal physician&#39;s office by phone and was told nothing could be done and to go ahead for the 2nd dose on April 21 2021.

He stayed in the pharmacy for 15 minutes before walking out to his car, where he began to experience visual loss. He describes how &#34;everything turned white and I couldn&#39;t see anything&#34;. He laid his seat back and symptoms resolved within 5 minutes. Pt checked his blood pressure when he got home and says it was 120/70. That was kind of low for him. Sounds like a vaso-vagal episode. Of note, he had not eaten yet that day.

                                                After my second COVID vaccine injection I noticed that I had developed tinnitus. What I hear is a high-pitched tone, apparently in both ears.  It is constant, and seems to be worse at night before I go to bed.   Note: I did suffer from tinnitus about 15 to 20 years ago, until I realized the cause was my occasional use of a table saw when I was not using ear plugs.  That instance of tinnitus went away once I began using earplugs, and did not return until two days ago, after I received my second COVID vaccine. I have a regular checkup with my regular physician today, and plan to tell him about the tinnitus.

                                                A fairly aggressive visual migraine, Episode lasted 15-30 minutes almost exactly 24 hours after injection.  It would seem there was no mention of migraines as a side affect. So figured it best to report just in case it was a sign of something more. The floaters and flashes were similar to those I have gotten prior to migraine headaches. This was unusual as normally they normally  do not interrupt my vision greatly and are simply in my vision and usually only in one eye. In this case it wasn&#39;t limited to one eye or one spot.. there were multiple and made it hard to focus and see. Usually when I get visual migraines, a headache comes shortly after. So far as of this writing, I only feel a tinge of a migraine coming on, but it is seeming to fade already.  Should note, I do not get migraines often (maybe once every other year or so.. ) and when I do it is usually after extended exposure to the sun and not on a chilly morning when I first wake up. Thus this report.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left (left shoulder) on 30Mar2021 09:00 (Lot Number: ER8733) at age of 53 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to events: caller states he don&#39;t think so, his father had high blood pressure and diabetes. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen taken for tooth disorder at 600 mg every 8-12 hours, taking it probably a week before receiving the vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No events following prior vaccinations. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient experienced slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at on 30Mar2021, chills on 02Apr2021, fever on 02Apr2021, sweating on 02Apr2021, continued muscle pain on 03Apr2021, skin, hair was hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin on 03Apr2021, muscular pain down to pelvis and knees aching on 03Apr2021, diarrhea on 03Apr2021, fatigue in 2021, headache in 2021, weakness and dizziness in 2021, sinus drainage in 2021, feels dehydrated in 2021.  The patient was calling to report some long term, severe side effects. He received the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He didn&#39;t have anything then muscle pain for the first two and a half days, no reaction until on Friday 02Apr2021 he had extreme chills, fever, sweating, then that continued on to be muscle pain, his skin and hair were hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin through Sunday 04Apr2021. It dissipated into muscular and inner-skeletal pain. He had muscular pain down to pelvis and knees and things would start aching.  Now it was kind of letting up. It was the 4th day now and no one he knows who had gotten it had such a long term reaction to this. Clarified that he had slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at and that dissipated on Thursday 01Apr2021 and he had no pain anymore and no other side effects. On Friday 02Apr2021 afternoon when it went haywire and thought he may have to go to the hospital on Sunday 04Apr2021. He had diarrhea and almost had everything on the list except redness at the site injection. He also did not have swollen lymph nodes. He didn&#39;t think he needed to go to the hospital, he normally didn&#39;t get sick and hadn&#39;t been ill for years and this was why he wanted to report it because it seemed that it was pulling for along time. He had been sleeping and drinking a lot of liquids. Headache, joint pain, and diarrhea continued all the way through Monday 05Apr2021 and started to dissipate Monday evening. He had no nausea and vomiting. The muscular pain down to pelvis started Saturday 03Apr2021. His knee would ache and then that would stop and then his other knee would ache then stop. It was like it would transfer around lower part of body, and that dissipated late Monday 05Apr2021 night into Tuesday (06Apr2021). Now he had fatigue was tired and had sinus drainage. He felt dehydrated and couldn&#39;t seem to drink enough liquids to get the feeling of dry mouth out.  The diarrhea, fatigue and the sinus drainage was still continuing and the other symptoms seem to have dissipated. He still felt so fatigued and didn&#39;t feel the other symptoms are there. He hoped they didn&#39;t return. It had stayed the same for the diarrhea, fatigue and sinus drainage and he was still tired. Later added he did have weakness and dizziness, but assumed it was fever and chills. Caller states he did have weakness and dizziness and Saturday 03Apr2021 and Sunday 04Apr2021 were the worst two for all of the symptoms at the same time. It had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021 evening. Outcome of weakness and dizziness: Caller initially confirmed it had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021. However, he later stated he was still experiencing slightness there. He still feels some weakness, and feels about 60% right now.  He thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated because he had family members that had contracted covid-19 and be less weary of the virus. He was hesitant now to get the second shot. He was taking ibuprofen because he had issues with a tooth. He was taking Benadryl for the sinus and hadn&#39;t taken it in 36 hours and hadn&#39;t taking anything else. He was already taking Ibuprofen for the tooth issue, but was also using it to relieve some of the symptoms and if it was indeed that he may have contracted something after that. He hadn&#39;t been to the doctor but for checks ups in years and years.  Time of Onset (24-hour clock): Caller stated it started about 1-2 pm in the afternoon on Friday 02Apr2021 and came on very quickly. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of diarrhea, fatigue, sinus drainage was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                The morning after the 2nd shot, I woke to severe tinnitus, hearing sensitivity, headache, earache, and fullness in the ears. I went to my PCP and she said that I had an infection of the middle ear. I took a course of Augmentin. Later, when I sent an ENT, the infection had cleared but the symptoms remained.

                                                I&#39;ve been experiencing ear ringing  from ear clogging to buzzing, hissing sounds. First it is started in my left ear after few days of the first doze then the right ear. It started real bad after the second injection. Presently, the clogging ear state has diminished but the buzzing, hissing and cricket alike sounds yet present. This pulsatile emerging sounds of perhaps tinnitus,  disrupts my personal life and to concentrate me at work.

A 53-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 18May2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient had no family medical history. The patient did not have history of all previous immunization with the vaccine considered as suspect. The patient did not administered additional vaccines on same date of the vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medication(s) included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM) taken for hypothyroidism, start and and ongoing. On Saturday 22May2021, he had ringing on his ears. He wanted to know if that was from the vaccine or not. At the time that it happened, he was pressure washing and he was not sure if the loud noise contributed to his tinnitus. He has a history 10 years ago of tinnitus. The pressure washer was very loud. Then he started to wonder. He had pressured washed before and never had it before. Caller stated that he still had the ringing. It was not as bad as it was at first. The patient stated he did not do anything but try to stay away from loud noises. The outcome of the event was improving.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EN6201), via an unknown route, on 12Feb2021 (at 12:45) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Relevant medical history included atrial fibrillation from Jun2020, ablation surgery for atrial fibrillation on unknown date, ongoing atrial tachycardia, and ongoing premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Past drug history included allergy to penicillin. Relevant concomitant medications included vitamin NOS, mineral NOS (MEGA MEN) and amino acids NOS, carotenoids NOS, herbal NOS, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane, minerals NOS, vitamins NOS (GNC MEGA MEN SPORT). Within approximately two minutes of receiving the shot, he felt a warm sensation travel from the left shoulder area to his chest/upper stomach, his eyes burned, he could taste something, and his heart rate became rapid at a steadily increase amount. He watched his heart rate tick up on her watch to approximately 113 BPM. His normal resting heart rate was upper 60s. He felt dizzy and out of it for about 30 minutes. He felt like he had tunnel vision and lost speed sensation in the car he was driving. His pulse stayed at 92-94 BPM for approximately two hours. He wasn&#39;t anxious about getting the shot and had actually been looking forward to it. The patient was not treated for the events. The patient had recovered from &#39;felt dizzy&#39; on 12Feb2021 while the remaining events resolved in Feb2021.

                                                Ten  minutes after receiving his vaccination, he developed lightheadedness, vision changes (? vision became cloudy?) , paresthesias in bilateral upper extremities.  He was able to sit back down. No falls or trauma to his head or any part of his body. He was placed on a stretcher to a private section of the arena and monitored. Initially, his blood pressure was 103/69,  and interval blood pressure 20 minutes later was 139/73.  He was given water to drink, which he tolerated.  He reports that he has similar reactions to needles in the past, but the current presentation is longer than usual (symptoms usually resolve in five minutes). He was able to recover from the symptoms after 25 minutes of monitoring.

                                                Prior to receiving  Pfizer vaccine, I had mild tinnitus, which did not bother me during the day with normal ambient sounds and I was able to drown it out with a fan running at night bedside. It is now much more noticeable during the day and the fan is not as effective.  At times, during the day, I need to turn on music or something to drown out the ringing.

Now (4/7/2021), when I talk to people or watch TV, I hear lots of echoes from my left ear. I also felt ringing inside of my left ear even no sounds outside.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                About 48 hours after the shot, I developed flu-like symptoms: chills, mild diarrhea, body ache, and low fever. These dissipated in the next 36 hours. HOWEVER, during this time I developed bilateral, persistent high-pitch tinnitus. This problem is significant enough to affect sleep and concentration. The tinnitus remains persistent three weeks later.

The tinnitus is extremely loud 24/7 making my days feel like I have PTSD and my nights difficult to sleep. I need music, TV, or white noise on 24/7. The elevated level of tinnitus has not subsided since it ramped up.

                                                Tinnitus - ringing in both ears. No prior condition before receiving the COVID shot.  I received the injection of the Pfizer COVID vaccine (dose #1) at 2:30pm on May 13, 2021 at  the Pharmacy . I had a normal day the remainder of the day (work, errands, taking care of my children, etc.) so either the tinnitus had not yet developed or, because of the external sounds, I didn&#39;t notice it. I first noticed it the next morning when I awoke but went about my day (with more external sounds masking it). Later that day, I was in a quiet location and noticed the noise again; I thought it might be an electrical motor humming or something (I was in a public place); it was not.  The sound is a high pitched &#39;white noise&#39; sound, is continuous, has not improved and is most noticible when in quiet situations (reading, sleeping, working on the computer).   While the government machine convinced me to do my civic duty to receive the first injection, I will not return for the second injection.

A 54-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Apr2021 08:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8736) (at the age of 54-years-old) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) 20mg ER. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 29Mar2021 08:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) (at the age of 54-years-old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 27Apr2021 at 09:00 (day after injection) on the same arm, the patient experienced wrist itching and hand swelling (left). On the next evening on 28Apr2021, both wrists were itching and both hands were swelling with severe pain, lasted 3 hours then they went away completely. The next day on 29Apr2021 at 03:00, both heels were itching, toes were swollen mildly with almost no pain. The next day on 30Apr2021, inside of right elbow was itching, swelling and medium pain. The next day on 01May2021, there was nothing. The next day on 02May2021, both armpits swelling and itching extreme with severe pain in both shoulders which radiated down to hips after 1 hour started to go to emergency room (ER) but it all vanished completely. Sometimes the patient got a day break but otherwise, since 27Apr2021 this had happened to some part of his body (most commonly in hands) up to Friday 28May2021. The patient was put on second round of steroids and now antihistamines and he hadn&#39;t had any symptoms for 2 days. The severe itching and pain also occurred at other locations such tongue, inside of cheeks, throat, and chest pain radiating into neck, left side of neck swelling and aching. The patient had never had similar symptoms before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment medications to lessen swelling and pain. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                The first night I had itching down my left arm and palm of my hands, my wrist. Then my hands swelled up quite large. It lasted about 3-4 hours and then completely went away. The following day, the same thing happened but this time it was both hands around midday. I had some pain, but it was not severe. This lasted 3-4 hours again and went away. The next day, both my armpits swelled up profusely and itched. I had light itching on both arms and swelling again. On my back, the pain shot down my back and in my left hip. The pain was not extreme, it was just uncomfortable. This lasted a few hours and went away as usual. About 24 hours and nothing happened. Then my left hand and palm started itching lightly. My tongue and mouth began itching and swelling profusely to a point where i couldn&#39;t eat anything. The next day, my heels started itching on both feet and my toes swelled up. I saw my doctor who provided me steroids. They lasted 5 days and I had no symptoms while on the steroids. When the steroids ended, my throat started to swell and my mouth as well. It got a little difficult to breathe but by the time I got ready to go to the ER it had subsided. This was accompanied by lite swelling and itching in my left hand. The same symptoms keep occurring. I went to an allergist/immunization specialist. I am now on my 3rd run of steroids. As soon I am off the steroids, my symptoms return. I have also been on antihistamines which seemed to help a little in conjunction with the steroids. Without the steroids, they do not help.

A 54-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 at vaccination age of 54-year-old via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22May2021 16:00 (Lot Number: EWO179) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 in Nov2020 to Nov2020 prior to vaccination. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) and alprazolam (XANAX), both indications, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine in a public health clinic or facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that 2 days after the vaccination (24May2021 08:00), the patient&#39;s vision was disrupted when he would move his head. He saw almost what you would call double vision whenever he moved his head, like while driving or looking from one side to the other. He couldn&#39;t drive for about 3 days because the movement of one car would look like 2 cars. This didn&#39;t happen when head was still and looking straight. His equilibrium was totally off, his head felt wobbly, his head was in a fog type haze for about 2 weeks. The feeling was scary. He mentioned that he did have covid Nov2020. He added that he made phone call to his doctor and they said to give it 2 weeks before coming in which is exactly when symptoms started to subside but still feel a little off. The patient did not received treatment for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

                                                Approximately 20 minutes of receiving the first dose of Pfizer COVIN19 vaccine, I started to develop a metallic taste in my mouth.  Shortly after the metallic taste started, saliva production decreased causing severe dry mouth and it became difficult to swallow.  I went to the closest hospital which was approximately a 10 minute drive from when symptoms started and explained what was going on to the person at the triage desk.  I did NOT request to be seen by a doctor because symptoms had started to lesson but I did wait at the ER since it was a public place for approximately 30 minutes before traveling home.  Approximately 2 hours after onset of symptoms, saliva production had returned to normal levels.

The ring has not stopped since getting the 1 st shot . I saw my Primary doctor and did all my blood work wand checkup and everything came back normal and refereed me to   a ENT doctor Facility.  He said everything look normal  and said it must be the Vaccine that caused the Tinnitus.

Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, Lot number; unknown) via intramuscularly on the left arm on 07Feb2021 at 9.30 am (at the age of 55-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that, after 5 days taking the vaccine, on 12Feb2021 at 12:00 AM I started to have ringing of the ears. I never experienced this and it has occurred for the past 2 days in both ears. I need to know if I should hold off on the second doses and if this ringing of the ears has been reported for other patients taking your Vaccine. I am scheduled for my 2nd shot on 28Feb2021. Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have covid prior vaccination. Patient did not tested covid post vaccination. No treatment was received for the event. Outcome of event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After having slight headaches(normal side effects) with dull eye pain from 11pm thru overnight of March 23,  at 10:30 I went out drving in car and my eyes were squinting. with heavy dark clouds(not bright) outside.   I looked at my pupils and they were pinpoint to slightly bigger.   My glasses are auto tint, but not so much behind car windows.   When I got home I sat in a dim room(lights off, but sliding door blinds closed but some light coming in) for an hour eating lunch.  I then checked my pupils and they were about a third the size of my iris.    Mild headache, dull eye pain and squinting continued.   I searched the internet and found no details about eye problems.  I called, ask a nurse and was told they found no information about eye problems at CDC or internet related to vaccine, but perhaps it is headache causing eye problems.    Seems like this should be listed somewher!  Or do I need to see my opthalmologist?   You should be complete in side effects that eye problems are possible.   I had no problems prior to vaccine.    Do with this what you will(likely ignore it as you are bidens cdc).

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 00:30 (lot number: ENG6199) (at age 55 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization administered in a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included tramadol taken for numbing shot for tooth, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccines received in four weeks. The patient experienced the following with his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Shot was painful and in about 15 to 20 minutes later everything felt fine. But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side. They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM. Treatment was not given for the events. The patient recovered from the event &#34;shot was painful&#34; on 12Mar2021; while recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Mar2021.

                                                Three days after shot #1, began to experience a constant ringing in the ears of medium discomfort (29-Mar-2021). As of the date of this report submission, it has not stopped. I am scheduled to see an ENT on Thursday, 1-Apr-2021.

                                                6 days after injection I experienced an increase in fluid in my right eye, similar to central serous retinopathy events I had many years before. This resulted in a gray circular disc in my field of vision and distortion in vision that remains to this day. I followed up with my retina specialist, in office images show an increase in fluid from images taken two months prior.

Finally today, Thurs., the symptoms are subsiding. Have used otc meds including cold and flu syrup, tablets, and allergy relief. Writing as I am finding comfort from FEXOFENADINE WHEN OTHERS DID LITTLE other than make me totally useless from extreme drowsiness; and because these symptoms are not the typical reported issues that come and go within a day or two of injection.  Specifically, the store brand product is apparently highly effective and without the drowsiness issues.

                                                I received the vaccine about two - three inches from the center of the muscle and in back of center - it was more in back of deltoid than the front of my deltoid. When I first got the shot, I had a burning sensation from the site of needle to back of neck to behind my ear area. It felt like a burning aching feeling. My ear felt like it was clogged up and aching. I told the medical site about it and the doctor on site said that more likely they hit a nerve. My blood pressure was very elevated. They had me stay to be observed for 45 minutes. I went back to work. I still felt it at night. The next day, I started feeling up my neck and my collarbone and my left side of my face and my head - my face felt tight and my lip felt numb on the left side and I had a slight confusion too. I went to Emergency room. They did CAT Scan and exam. After that, I noticed it was going all the way down my arm, all the left side of my body to toes. It felt like numbness - like neuropathy type feeling. It felt like constant pain. I went to the Urgent Care and they gave me Prednisone steroid (5 days of it) 5 mg to help with inflammation.  I took that for the five days. I started noticing a little black bruising on my body. After that,  I went to the Urgent Care again and they gave me Naproxen  and and Dr gave me more Naproxen to take.  He took bloodwork, too. I went to the ER and I was still feeling sick and hot. They said it was anxiety. I am still going through it - I feel it on the spot where I got the shot - and on my neck and on my head and on my left eye and down on my legs a lot - some days are worse than others but not as bad as when I had the first symptoms.

This hearing loss and tinnitus improved after 8 days.  Hearing loss and tinnitus gradually improved (estimated 90-95% return in hearing with tinnitus varying).  Hearing loss after receiving the vaccine was more rapid (severe loss of hearing in right ear over a two day period).

                                                I was at the Neuroscience center and in the auditorium shorty after.  Where I started to sweat, blurred vision, very difficult to breath and losing some motor skills.  Luckily I got up in time and went to one of the nurses up front that got me to a waiting area to cool down, some water and to breathe without the mask.  Probably stayed about 30 minutes as my vitals were pretty low before returning to normal.  I will say it was pretty hot and a little crowded in there and the nurses all said it&#39;s been happening a bit with the heat in there. And it was about 11:40am so I only had crackers in the morning.

                                                I received the first Pfizer injection Tuesday, April 13th.  I had signed up for the 12:15 slot, but when I arrived it was like a cattle call.  I arrived in time for what I thought was a 12:15 appointment but ended up standing in line for an hour before actually getting the shot.  I was fine the rest of that day aside from developing soreness in the muscles of my right arm.  The following morning, Wednesday, April 14th,  I was awakened to very noticeable soreness in both arms and the back of my neck. As the morning progressed, I developed flu-like symptoms, complete body aches, chills, fever, slight nausea, blurred vision, mild diarrhea.

                                                The evening of my second dose, when getting into bed with the lights off, I noticed bright lights flashing out of my right eye.   I still notice this including today.  On Mar 25th, I called a college friend, Dr. , a Retinal Surgeon, and described my symptoms.  He suggested it would be prudent that I have this routinely checked out.  He suggested a facility with an Optos scanner.  On March 29th, I visited my usual optometrist, at facility, and had an exam, with this test, an with my eyes dialtated.  He diagnosed Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD).  I realize this could be a coincidence, but feel it is appropriate to report this as I first noticed it the night of my second vaccination.

                                                I had pain at injection site, mild night sweats, and increased tinnitus (I have had tinnitus for many years) the night of / after the first and second shots (03/26/21 and 04/16/21)  After the second shot, I had less pain at the injection site, mild body aches, and increased tinnitus the night of the second injection.  However, the real reason I am reporting this is because after the second dose, the increased tinnitus continued intermittent, usually in the evenings. The tinnitus became especially pronounced on day 2 or 3, 4,  5 and day 8 - the ringing became so loud on the evening of day 2 that it seemed I was having trouble hearing the television. And on the evening of day 8 after the second dose, the tinnitus again became quite loud, with the additional symptom that external noises were annoying / irritated me.  I have had constant tinnitus for at least 20 years, and it almost never bothers me (or is even noticeable.) However, the tinnitus symptoms after the second Pfizer shot were pronounced enough that I thought I would report it. Of course, I can&#39;t be sure the tinnitus symptoms - especially those at days 4, 5 and 8 - are indeed side effects of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, but since I had increased tinnitus symptoms the night after both the first and second Pfizer doses, it would seem to me to probably not be a coincidence.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

The client looked flushed.  The client was instructed to lay on a mat on the floor.  Client drank some juice and ate some pretzels.  After 20 minutes he reported that he was no longer experiencing any symptoms.  As the client was standing up he reported that he felt dizzy but this resolved as he walked around the room.  He then wanted to sit outside so two nurse&#39;s went with him .  After 40 minutes he reported that all of his symptoms had resolved.  We followed up with the client on 4/25/21 and the client reported that he had not experienced any additional symptoms.

Volume fluctuates. Sounds like crickets or an electronic hum/buzz sound. Very disturbing and it&#39;s hard to concentrate and hard to sleep. The research I&#39;ve done indicates this is Tinnitus.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic.

A 55-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: unknown), via an unspecified route on 01Apr2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced head aches on 01Apr2021 and double vision on unspecified date in Apr2021. Patient stated that since he had the second shot Pfizer 01Apr2021, that same day he started having head aches and hasn&#39;t stopped since, last week Wednesday, he started having double vision that still exists, went to the eye doctor, bought new glasses. They want him to see a specialist next. Since he had the second shot this has been going on with him that is why he thought it was related to the vaccine. He asked is there anything else he should be doing. Response was a review of the prescribing information for Pfizer BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE did not find information regarding double vision. Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE).

A 55-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number, Expiration date, NDC and UPC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jun2021 at 11:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Regarding lot number patient stated that it looks like EW, patient thought he was not sure if it was 6185 or 0185, not sure it looks like 0 but it looks like 6 too but patient think it was 0. The patient medical history included shortness of breath, sleep apnea and kidney disease (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient sees a doctor for lot of conditions one was for shortness of breath and sleep apnea and sees a neurologist for Bph. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient explained he was reluctant from getting vaccinated and nervous before the shot. On 06Jun2021, after patient took the shot, probably around 11:30 in the morning, patient was same, soon after 5 min maybe more, patient got a sensation on the left side of his tongue 5-10 mins, then  kind of a weird taste came to his mouth, patient started to get a little dizzy, a little light headedness, weakness in his chest and both his arms, got shortness of breath but had been seeing a doctor for shortness of breath prior taking the Covid shot and had kind of reluctant of taking the shot but some other issues going on side,  patient decided to take it, a couple of hours after the shot, patient had a headache, had the diarrhea. Patient described the weird taste like having a penny in his mouth. Patient explained he consulted a doctor on that Monday (07Jun2021), who said she encountered patients who also had the sensation on their tongues following vaccination, and that it was normal. Today (08Jun2021) patient had feeling just a little bit of nausea and patient kind a feel like a little brain fog, it was just his head doesn&#39;t feel right, the major concern was says some things risks factors and some of them had severe reactions, patient had a reaction difficulty in breathing, dizziness and feel little bit weakness, patient kind of a felt like his throat was going to close and he won&#39;t say he had any difficulty in swallowing, but it was not normal. Patient developed symptoms which spooked and scared him. Patient did not have his lab test but was constantly going to patient had just had right heart catheter right two weeks ago, you know last for him, patient was supposed to take another lab test to conduct at the end of the month for cholesterol, but patient saw neurologist for kidney disease. Events did not improve, patient just had this brain fog you know. Patient had to call a doctor after he got home, they did not prescribe him anything, patient mean he did bunch of appointment with doctor with the phone as soon as he got home from taken a Covid shot he was little worried. Patient stated he was concerned about getting the second dose of vaccine scheduled on 27Jun2021. Patient stated he will not be able to consult his doctor before the vaccination appointment and was not able to get further assistance from a pharmacist. Patient repeated he does not know what to do about the second dose. Patient was kind of reluctant taking the next shot, if he was going to feel the something like this again, he don&#39;t want to, as he already had uneasy you know just had and patient did not had difficulty in breathing all of time this comes and go,  from the sentence he described it says on pamphlet that there was severe reaction to the shot and don&#39;t want to take the second shot and then end up in hospital because patient had more from it so his question was he was afraid to take the second shot. Patient don&#39;t had answer to that he means he would like to talk to somebody who can give him information kind of help me to relax little bit if it was normal and in in response it was responded that decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by the company. Patient was referred to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection, as healthcare provider knows his health situation and had access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of brain fog was not recovered and outcome for other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

                                                Uveitis (underlying condition occurring once every 2-3 years, I was NOT in a flare up at the time of the injection), and mouth ulcers (underlying condition occurring 2-3 times a year, I was NOT in a flare up at the time of the injection). For the Uveitis I went to my eye doctor and started a prednisolone regimen and am still on it. I received the 2nd does (lot EL9264) yesterday on 3 Feb at 09:00am. The mouth ulcers were treated with oral medication-Valtrex. 2nd dose does not seem to have aggravated the above noted reactions. Other symptoms common to the injection are occurring but seem more intense after the 2nd dose (aches, low energy, some minor coughing)

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

                                                On Thursday April 1, 10 days after the vaccine (1st shot)  I began to experience itch hives all over my body.  I took Benadryl at 2 pm and 8 pm to relieve the symptoms. It helped. At 7 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  I took Claritin to relieve symptoms but it was not effective. At 9:15 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  my lips and cheeks began to go numb, and it felt as if my throat and tongue were swelling.  At 9:30 am. I checked in to the ER.  They monitored my condition and indicated my blood pressure and oxygen levels were normal. At approximately 10:15 am, my mouth began to feel normal again. While at the ER, the  doctor checked out my hives and gave me Prednisone. She also gave me a prescription for 4 days of Prednisone, 50 mg tablets,  and advised to continue taking Benadryl to relieve symptoms. I have taken Prednisone once a day for past couple days and Benadryl 3 times a day. Hives are still present today Sunday April 4, 2021 but milder than previous days.[Not certain if this is important, but on  day 3 and 4 after the vaccine, I reported dizziness on mobile app check-in. The dizziness went away by day 5. I had no other symptoms appear until day 10 reported here.

                                                I had no side effects from a 1st dosage of the Covid-19 vaccine except a little soreness at the injection site.  I had a 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid -19 vaccine at 11:30 a.m. on 3/31/21.  Afterwards I went for a walk, came home, and fell asleep.  I awoke at approximately 5:30 p.m., about six hours following the 2nd dose of vaccine, to an awful tone in both ears. This was most severe during the first 48 hours.  This has continued as of this writing.  At this point, I would self-diagnose this as some level of tinnitus.  I have no previous history of tinnitus.  This is awful -- need help!

                                                Inflamation and pain on left side of the body, beginning in the arm/shoulder and spreading to neck and left tonsil.  Tonsil swelling was quite pronounced by 2am (nearly twelve hours after the injection) and blocked the airway when head was turned to the left, necessitating a makeshift pillow brace to keep head turned to the right overnight.  Tonsil swelling began to diminish by about 6am and only slight enlargement remains thirty hours after injection.  Additionally, a low-grade fever began at about 10 pm (~7 hours after injection) and reached a maximum of 100.5 degrees F approximately twenty-four hours after the injection.  By twenty-eight hours, temperature was within normal limits (though still nearly a degree higher than typical for this patient).  As of this writing, some thirty hours after the injection, headache, neck ache, and eye-ache persist, but none is severe.  Symptoms appear to be continuing their improvement.  I (the patient/recipient) hope the second installment of the vaccine is no worse than this one.  The only truly alarming symptom was the swollen tonsil and some thought was given to seeking medical attention, but the pillow brace seemed to do the trick for keeping the airway open, so no assistance was sought.   I have no doubt that these short-lived symptoms are much better than actual disease and I will not hesitate to follow up with the second vaccine installment?but I will monitor the tonsil situation very carefully.

My arms, chest, back, and legs. As the day went on and I moved around, the hives disappeared. Before going to bed, I noticed that my left eye was mildly swollen. The next morning, I woke up and the hives returned. Again, after moving around, the hives went away. Later in the late afternoon and into the evening, I noticed that both of my eyes were swollen and so was my upper lip. I woke up and the hives returned, only one eye was swollen and my lip was swollen. By later in the afternoon, the hives and swelling had just about disappeared. The following morning, I was back to normal with no hives and no swelling around my eyes or lips.

Went for second shot despite being unsteady, it has not gone away now going on 10 weeks. Hearing is down and fullness in my left year.  Saw an ENT and my family practitioner. Nothing they can do, so I  take meclizine on the really bad days, which helps a little. Very hard to function since the shot.

                                                I have non-stop ringing in both my ears. The ear on the left is often worse than ear on the right, but ringing is present in both ears, 24/7. I never had ringing, but after the 2nd shot of Pfizer, a few days later, it started and it has not gone away. It&#39;s been a month since receiving the vaccination.

I did not have muscle weakness any where or slurred speech. That sensation was not painful, but it was very noticeable like someone&#39;s hand was on your face. That was present for about two days at a significant level. Five weeks later it is still present but at a much milder degree. Also persistent over the entire 5 weeks since the shot is mild dizzyness off and on each day, along with increased headaches. Since i have chronic post concussion syndrome, it is normal for me to get headaches, but since the vaccination I have been getting headaches more frequently and I am a lot more sensitive to the usual triggers. I have a persistent mild pain in or around my left eye that never existed before.

A 57-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscular, in the left arm, on 05Jan2021 07:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications were unspecified. The patient took unspecified medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for covid-19 post vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. On 07Jan2021, the patient experienced diplopia due to left 6th (abducen) cranial nerve palsy. The event resulted in doctor office/clinic visit, and emergency room visit. Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event which included fresnel prism on current glasses to alleviate diplopia. Outcome of the event was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported diplopia due to left 6th (abducen) cranial nerve palsy and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

I can still the normal things that I usually have before this began.  It?s really difficult to explain.  I still smell and still taste with no problem.  It is just very annoying that when I am breathing and not focusing on smelling something that I smell this strange stale smell.

                                                Experienced a delayed reaction to vaccine that occurred at 11 p. m.  Administration was at 8:23 a. m. earlier in the day.  Symptoms began as build up of mucous in back of throat and reflux. Very early the next morning symptoms progressed to near inability to swallow,    Took 50 mg of Benadryl which gave a bit of relief.  Very hard to drink the water and get it down with the two pills.  The symptoms included swollen lips and inside of the mouth swelling.  Went to the emergency room at the Clinic  at 7:30 a. m.   I was given 60 mg of Prednisone, Pepsid to coat the stomach re the steroids. Was sent home with prescription for epi pen, medrol dose pack, Pepsid and Zyrtec.  Symptoms improved except for swelling of lips.  However, on 3/11/21, despite taking the medication, the symptoms worsened in terms of renewed lip swell as well as new symptoms of facial flushing and chest flushing.  Symptoms then abated with medication.  On 3/13/21, symptoms flared again with renewed lip swelling, inside and outside check swelling and outside face and chest flushing.  They they abated again with medication.  On 3/14/21, lip swelling renewed as a symptom.  To date, my lips do not feel right but tingly and bloated and irritated.  Saw an allergist this morning who thinks I am allergic to polyglycol a preservative in the vaccine.

I then became flushed in the face and my tongue felt odd as if it was swelling.  My throat became dry.  I waiting five more minutes and decided to take the next exit off of I87 and drove directly to a urgent care center.  Upon arrival I sat in my car for 20 more minutes to see if my symptoms would pass and they did.  I did not need to enter into the urgent care facility.  I have not had any other symptoms since this event.

                                                Broke out in hives/rash on the front of my neck.  It was itchy and I treated it with Hydrocortizone.  This initially started on 05/03/2021 and as of today, 05/05/2021 the hives are still present. On the date of the 2nd vacination i felt totally exhausted and felt like I hit a wall withing 4 hours of receiving he 2nd vaccine.  This reaction was more pronounced than after the 1st vaccine.  This went on for 3 days.  I am still experiencing being very tired.  I also had a metalilc taste in my mouth on the first day after the 2nd vaccine that lasted for a week.

                                                After four days of getting the vaccine, on 4/10/21, I had strong a strong smell of a combination of metallic, vinegar and distilled alcohol smell that overpowered everything that I smelled and tasted. This was happening throughout the day and continued for about a week. After about a week the smell decreased and my sense of taste started to improve. As of 4/30/21 the worst time of this occurring  smell &amp; taste was in the morning and occasionally during the day. Today, 5/5/21, with reduced adverse effects, I received my second Covid-19 vaccination. Nothing has changed as of four hours after this second shot.

The ringing in my right ear has been nonstop since it started.  The other symptoms have come and gone intermittently but are still present.

                                                I got two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. First dose on 4/5/21 second on 4/26/21 Over the last several weeks I have starting the to have problems with taste. The mint tums I take for heartburn started to taste nasty. Then chocolate started tasting bad. I used to love good dark chocolate, now any chocolate is disgusting. Yesterday I had a frozen Coca Cola at McDonald?s. It had that same nasty taste as the tums and chocolate but much worse. Lemon scented cleaners smell like the bad covid taste. Toothpaste has the nasty taste and some candies taste that way also. It seems more and more things are starting to have this nasty taste and the effects keep getting worse.

                                                Mild to moderate tinnitus in both ears. Started approx the day after receiving first dose. More noticeable when less background noise. Hear it every day. Not really any changes in symptoms. Within the first two weeks however, I heard occasional and much louder and noticeable bursts of ear ringing that lasted 15-30 seconds. Have not heard that since the first couple of weeks. Now just chronic mild tinnitus, which is currently manageable. I would very much like to get fully vaccinated, but I&#39;m very concerned about receiving the second dose since others I&#39;ve spoken to who have experienced similar side effects from the first dose have reported worsening on second dose and some indicating their tinnitus becoming unmanageable. I&#39;m very concerned that this condition could become disabling after second dose. I&#39;ve tried very hard to research this and see if there are any mitigation measures that I could do to prevent worsening of tinnitus on second dose. Only thing I have heard is that I should receive second dose as far as possible from area of side effect, and that my second shot should be in the thigh. I also considered getting one of the other vaccines as the second dose, but they have all had reports of tinnitus, so I don&#39;t think that would make a difference. The general medical community has no knowledge of how to help people with this issue and is not accepting that my condition was caused by the vaccine. However, I have NEVER had long term tinnitus. Only rarely in my life, which was short lived, such as after hearing a loud noise. But not like this. While the medical community can debate the cause and effect, I&#39;m fairly confident my reaction was due to the vaccine. People who have Covid also have reported tinnitus, so I imagine this is something to do with the body&#39;s immune response. There are MANY more people experiencing this side effect than have reported I am sure. These people would all like to be fully vaccinated (if they have not received the second dose) and this needs to be addressed if we are going to help relieve their hesitancy. The Director for a large regional hospital system in the area told me that my choice is: receiving the second dose and possibly becoming disabled with severe Tinnitus (as side effects experienced on first dose are normally, but not always, worse after second dose of a vaccine) OR getting Covid!!Neither one is a good outcome!!

About 6 days post vaccine, I woke up with flushing and both ears started to ring, more signficantly in the left ear.  I took my blood pressure and it was elevated at 160/90.  I went to the doctor the next day and had an MRI (came back normal).  I was prescribed blood medication (amlodipine). I went to an audiologist and was found to have hearing loss.  I went back to my PCP and my BP was still elevated and was prescribed atenolol in addition to amlodipine.   Currently, I am still having flushing, fatigue, and tinnitus.

                                                I did not experience any side effects from my first Pfizer dose.  Approximately 12 hours after the vaccine (second dose), I developed mild flu-like symptoms and  I ran a low grade (99.7F) fever.  During the time I had a fever, I developed a low-level, high pitch ringing in both my ears.  By the next morning, the flu-like symptoms and fever were gone, but the tinnitus remained.  After two months, I still have ringing in both years.  Though I still consider the volume low level, it has gotten more noticeable over time.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 at 57-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 31Mar2021 at single dose, and the second dose at 57-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 21Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, and testosterone, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at an unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020, and left arm bothered him. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported his tongue and taste buds were &#34;screwed up&#34; and it had been painful to eat which had resulted in weight loss of 50 pounds in the last 5 months and this had gotten worse since being vaccinated. He was fatigued and his whole body hurt and sports injuries from past were very painful. He had previous Covid infection in Dec2020. He had seen many doctors and had an appointment with neurologist coming up. He didn&#39;t have much hope. He felt like he had 75% Covid all the time and his body felt like he had been hit by a truck. Not really that bad but like his taste buds were screwed up and it kind of progressed since he received the vaccine. Ever since the patient got the vaccine, the arm that he got the vaccine in it killed him, every joint in his body hurt, and he had seen lots of doctors about this and no one could figure it out. The patient was 250 pounds before this started. Patient was having something wrong with his tongue and taste buds, it was hard to explain. It was painful to eat, the patient had been to an ENT and they were sending the patient to neurology to figure it out. The tongue thing went away they thought it was thrush, then talked to another ENT and thought it was something neurological. The patient&#39;s whole body hurt. The patient was unsure when all of this started but he stated that it had worsened over the last couple of months. The patient&#39;s mouth was in pain. The patient was fatigued. The patient&#39;s left arm bothered him before the vaccine but it had progressively gotten worse over time. All of the symptoms that the patient had from COVID got progressively worse after the vaccine. The patient&#39;s arms were really lose and it felt like the arms wanted to come out of the socket. The pain could be a 9/10 and nothing touched it. The day after the first shot, the patient got testosterone shots, they found and erratic heartbeat which freaked out the patient. They did and EKG and said it was okay but couldn&#39;t determine what it was. Patient was tested and it showed hypothyroid and they did an intake test. The doctors thought it was thyroiditis but that got better but then it snowballed into what it was. Investigations: The patient was tested for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and all sorts of different things which were all negative. The patient was a healthy guy otherwise, besides these symptoms. Action taken in response to the events for testosterone was unknown. Outcome of events his tongue and taste buds were &#34;screwed up&#34;, the arm that he got the vaccine in it kills him/left arm bothered him before the vaccine but it had progressively gotten worse over time, every joint in his body hurt, and erratic heartbeat was not resolved, and of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899; Expire Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm, right upper, on 16Dec2020 11:10 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was hospital. The vaccine was not administered at military facility. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. The patient got ill from all pain medications- from prescription strength pain killers to OTC products such as tylenol, ibuprofen and aspirin.

                                                Almost immediately, my peripheral vision became filled with moving shapes. And, though I typically do have the black floaters, these are different. Most were white, and looked similar to pinwheel fireworks. Later, I noticed that my peripheral vision started included &#39;moving patterns&#39; with zig-zag shapes, and these patterns would move in random directions. Finally, there are the stationary patterns, where, again, in my peripheral vision,  random shapes  would appear to filled with  the zig-zag lines mentioned earlier, but the filled shape itself was stationary.

Today, I was pleased to note that I had ZERO pain, aches, sickness, etc. HOWEVER, as this day has progressed I?ve had less and less ability to taste food and/or drinks. It doesn?t matter how strong I make the tea... it?s just wet.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the vaccine i started to get very bad chills and body aches and also fever that reached 102. Every bone in the body felt like it was cracking. This lasted about 24 hours. I was also sweating a lot. The sweating at night lasted 3 days. I have the dry mouth and tongue with a thick layer of saliva and the mouth is swollen. I also have very dry eyes and nose/throat. These also are the after side effects of covid which i had in mid jan that i was getting better from. After taking the vaccine the symptoms of swollen mouth and thick saliva including dry eyes flared up again. Today is day number 6 after the vaccine and its a little better but not much.

On Saturday 3/27,21, almost 4 days later, at about 1:00 PM, felt hives breaking out on my sides.  It traveled up to my lower armpits, but never went into my arm areas.  Later that day, it traveled down side of legs, but then dissipated.  I went to bed about 9:30 PM that night with only slight discomfort. At 1:30 AM on Sunday 3/28/21, I awoke with severely swollen lips and face.  My breathing began to get difficult, so I immediately headed to the ER at  (about 30 minutes away). They at first started to give me a dose of Benedryl, but I explained to them that I am allergic to it.  I then instead received some Prednisone and immediately the swelling subsided.  Dr.  prescribed 15 pills over a 5-day span to totally clear up the reaction.

This tooth had had a root canal and crown done approximately 20 years prior.  Seen by dentist 3 days after onset of pain (01/13/2021). He advised visit to endodontic specialist who performed a CT scan which indicated possible area of inflammation around root canal. Recommended antibiotics, pain medication and tooth extraction. Pain did not resolve. Returned to dentist (01/15/2021) who extracted the tooth. Pain resolved.

                                                At 1300 on March 26 I received the shot in my left arm. I went back to work after receiving the vaccine I returned to work. At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

                                                On the morning after the second vaccine, I awoke with a bad headache. I was expecting something like this so I didn&#39;t worry about it.  Within a couple of hours, however, the headache began to include migraine-like visual disturbances primarily in the left eye field of vision.  The pain got worse.  I took Tylenol as I was advised not to take ibuprofen.  The headaches and visual disturbances continued intermittently for a couple of weeks.  (The headaches are still here at a low level.  The visual disturbances/flashes disappeared after 12 days.)  While I was having the migraine-like symptoms, after about two or three days, I developed additional visual problems in my left eye.  There was like a gray nebula of strands in my visual field.  I went to the ophthalmologist on 4/6/21, 10 days after the shot.  She diagnosed Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD).  While she knew of no mechanism for the vaccine to cause this, I am reporting this as the headaches, visual disturbances/flashes, and the PVD developed immediately after the second Pfizer shot, headache rolling into flashes rolling into PVD nebula.  The doc said this may or may not go away after a while.  We shall see.

He had to continue looking at the ceiling for several minutes until the symptoms fully resolved.    He continues to feel as if the eyes &#34;might cross&#34;, but they have not done so.

                                                Approx. 4 days after first Pfizer vaccination, my ears started ringing mildly. As days went by, the ringing  would fade away them come back a little stronger. At the time of my second dose, I asked one  of the medical technicians if ringing of the ears was one of the side effects, she said &#34;yes&#34; and that if it continued, to consult my primary care doctor. Since then my ringing has been continuous, which after some research of my own, I suspect i have Tinnitus.

                                                The injection site was high on the deltoid; nearly to the apex of the shoulder. Within a few hours, I begin to experience some discomfort and a limited range of motion.  By the next morning, the right side of my neck was stiff. This may have been a result of me unable to sleep comfortably on my right side. I have also been having some slight headaches. Headaches are very rare for me, and these particular episodes do not tend to subside with over-the-counter relief. The oddest thing is my inability to focus visually. I wear corrective eye wear, but mostly for close work and reading. This Saturday, 4/24/2021, I had difficulty reading the subtitles on the television, with or without my glasses.

A 58-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 22Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151; Expiration Date: 01Jul2021) as 1st dose single for COVID-19 immunization, prophylaxis. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure measurement ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Today is the first day he has a voice since the injection on 23Apr2021. He later stated he received injection on 22Apr2021. Today he is able to speak. The patient experienced laryngitis on 23Apr2021, excessive sleepiness (sleeping until around 3pm every day for the last 3 days) and pain in sinus cavity on 03May2021, cannot hardly breathe on 24Apr2021, mouth blister on 23Apr2021, thrush on 26Apr2021, headache on 27Apr2021, severe cough and congestion and hacking up green stuff like infection (cough and nasal congestion). He is getting a little better and is on antibiotics and Mucinex and everything trying to get a control of it. It has been so bad he cannot breathe. He is still wheezing. Now it is like bronchitis and he is still coughing today. In the beginning, it was like pneumonia. It was so bad. Pain in mouth, pain in face from that and in the roof of his mouth near his teeth and it was extremely painful on an unspecified date. He did not realize they were there until he brushed teeth and popped them and had massive amounts of blood in his mouth. He did not experience anything like that before and that really scared him. They gave Nystatin to heal up his mouth. Blisters are fading and blood blisters have stopped bleeding. He still has pain in mouth and face from that. He was also given Albuterol to help him breathe. The antibiotic is a great big pink tablet. It is 800 some mg of Amoxicillin. All of these are in a pharmacy vial and he does not have a lot or expiration for any. He was also prescribed Bromphen cough syrup. It is in a pharmacy vial with no lot or expiration. All are in pharmacy vials except the Mucinex and it is over the counter. He started taking it after the vaccine to control the cough. No further details provided. He was going to see an infectious disease doctor. They were going to do a vaccine challenge test to find out if he needs IVIG. He will see if it is something inside of him that the vaccine triggered that he needs to fix and won&#39;t know until he sees the doctors. The doctor&#39;s are hoping the infectious disease doctor will be able to give him answer about second dose as well. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He received it at pharmacy and nothing happened the day of. He wanted to report what happened after that. He also would like to know if he should attempt to get second dose.

                                                After a few days I developed a loud noticeable ringing in my right ear. I never had this condition previously. It is constant and the volume is very high. I am not aware if I have it in my left ear but it is overwhelmingly obvious in my right ear. I have had a few earaches in that ear in the past few years. But no known condition. I never had this ringing previously.

He woke up with extreme hearing loss and extreme ringing in his ears as if he was under water with some problems in hearing.  It feels like today that he has cotton in his ears.  He did try some antihistamines which did not help.  He seems to be more tired since he&#39;s gotten the vaccine, lethargic and not completely with it.

He had several weeks of general malaise and mild headache.  He does not recall head trauma and had no bruising, &#34;goose egg&#34;, etc.  He felt generally unwell with a mild headache since then.  Then on May 16th, 2021, while traveling with his wife, his left hand and arm and left side of tongue became numb and week.  He was mildly confused.  His wife took him to the ER and he was transferred to hospital for neurosurgery admission. Hospital records note that they presume the subdural bleed was triggered from the fall the morning of May 5th.

                                                Sudden sensorineural hearing loss on the right ear. Symptoms started 1 week after the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on Monday 5/17. The hearing loss was accompanied by continuous buzzing sound, static noise, sensation of ear fullness, local discomfort, headache. It progressed over the first week. On saturday 5/22, I performed an online hearing test that confirmed the hearing loss (see section 19 for results). I went to urgent care to get the ear checked and cleaned, with no noticeable improvement in symptoms. On Sunday 5/23 I was started on 30 mg predinsone po. On Monday 5/24, I went to specialist care, she increased dose to 60 mg of prednisone and order additional tests.

                                                Severe tinnitus ( ear ringing) started at 4:20 a.m. ,(woke me up), on Tuesday April 13th, 2021, less than 48 hours after receiving the 1st dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine injection.  It&#39;s been so severe it&#39;s got to the point that I&#39;ve contemplated considering suicide.  It has totally turned my life upside down as it relates to sleep, working, daily functioning and living. On a scale of &#34;1 to 10&#34; I&#39;d rate my tinnitus a &#34;7&#34; in severity.   It&#39;s a very high pitched tone, it sounds like the test pattern the TV stations used to broadcast at midnight.  It&#39;s maddening. It&#39;s torture.   The first 4 weeks were really hell.  Now it vacillates between a 7 and a 4.  It gets worse at night when I lay down.   So as of today it&#39;s been 7 weeks and 1 day since the onset of this tinnitus.  I called Pfizer Thursday April 15th, they were no help.  I had a zoom call with an MD who recommended not taking the 2nd Pfizer dose and to see and ENT asap. I saw Dr. who prescribed Prednisone tablets.  I am still suffering greatly from this.   Never in my life have I had tinnitus.  Never in my life have I been around loud work environments.  This is a direct result of taking the Pfizer vaccine.  I am certain of this fact.

A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the upper left arm on 18Feb2021 at 16:00 (at the age of 58-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma growing up as a child. It was an underlying medical condition and high blood pressure. No investigation assessment was not provided. Concomitant medication included Metoprolol for high blood pressure and one other but doesn&#39;t know the name of the other one. Patient also took a water pill. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Consumer reported that patient received first dose of COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021. He had symptoms ever since. The reporter wanted to know did he get COVID from the shot or should he have been tested before he got the shot and how long would the side effects could last. The reporter clarified patient symptoms as lost sense of smell, stuffy nose, hot and cold sweats, diarrhea one day, night sweats and headache on an unknown date in Feb2021. She mentioned that she finds it strangely coincidental that they received the shot and then &#34;all of the sudden they can&#39;t smell&#34;. The vaccination card given to him was in the car. The reporter doesn&#39;t have it on hand to provide lot number. It was given on the same date and at the same time as consumer, so probably the same lot number she received. Consumer&#39;s lot number was EN6200. No adverse events resulted in physician&#39;s office visit nor emergency Room. The events were assessed as non-serious. The clinical outcome of events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On 1/10/21, approximately 48 hours after the 2nd dose in the COVID vaccine series, I experienced ringing in right ear for about one hour, followed by sudden, complete, single-sided hearing loss in the right ear.  The next day, some hearing was restored in the right ear but it was muffled. Examined by primary physician, and both both ears appeared normal. Referred to an otolaryngologist  for an examination and hearing test which showed high-frequency hearing loss in the right ear.  Prednisone 50 mg daily prescribed, with follow-up exam and hearing test schedule for 1/20/2021.  No change in hearing, as of 1/17/2021, still muffled hearing with &#34;full feeling&#34; in right ear.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

Pt also experienced double vision when opening the eye. Pt went to the Emergency Dept and was given an MRI and CT to r/o stroke and everything came out normal. He was diagnosed with a partial 3rd nerve palsy and was referred to Optometry where we saw him on Monday (today). Pt does indeed have a partial right 3rd nerve palsy which can happen after vaccinations.

Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

It has increased subsequent to my second dose on 3/4/2021. I had no other significant symptoms after my first dose, but did have sufficient pain at the injection site in my left upper arm the day following my shot to wake me up at night. That went away within 48 hours, but the tinnitus effects have not decreased to date.

Shortly later I had less and less control of the right side of my head, now I can&#39;t  move it. I have since discovered that I have Bell&#39;s Palsy due to the vaccine. I didn&#39;t know what it was until I went to the doctor as this has never happened to me before.

Chapped lips and slight blistering on inside of mouth. Symptom ceased on March 26. Hyper/enhanced sense of smell and taste.  Still continues through today, Sunday March 28.

                                                At 5:30 pm on April 4, one day subsequent to my 2nd dose, I lost hearing in my left ear accompanied by a feeling of pressure and  severe tinnitus.  No other known factors occurred prior to onset of deafness and tinnitus.   I am not experiencing any sinus symptoms, or am I aware of any blockage of my ear canal.  Attempts to clear the eustachian tube are unsuccessful, no crackling, popping, etc.  I have had light to moderate tinnitus in both ears for decades, but the sudden (instantaneous) onset of deafness accompanied by a very severe ringing is unprecedented. It is now 6:36 pm and the pressure is subsiding but the ringing and deafness continues.

                                                Began feeling a little warm and flushed and tired. I felt off overall. On the 8th around 12pm. I cam e home from work around 4:30 and laid down til 5:30 and I woke up feeling a little better but around 6:15 I felt the same as earlier that day and then it got worse. My ears were ringing loudly and I had shortness of breath, I had difficulty breathing, and my chest was tight and I had pain in the center of my chest and I was nauseous and hungry but really couldn&#39;t eat anything. I checked my BP at home and it was 189/127 and then 192/122. I was well hydrated but I drank 2 16 ounce glasses of water and sat down to try and relax. An hour later the ringing stopped and I was feeling much better. I took my BP again and it was up to 202/126. I decided to go to the ER at this time. around 11pm it was 143/89.    Ringing and flushed still present with some stomach issues (4/9)

                                                Six days after receiving the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a sudden, total loss of hearing in the left ear. This was accompanied by extreme vertigo and loud tinnitus which has not abated.  I have visited an ENT specialist and had three audiology tests, which has confirmed that there is no hearing function in the left ear.  ENT diagnosed as  labyrinthitis due to viral infection. Tried to reduce inflammation and potentially restore hearing function by injecting steroids directly into the ear. These treatments have not worked.   I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 4/11/21 as scheduled.

No c/o fever, headache, body aches.   Patient went to the urgent care for the first time and they prescribed him Acyclovir &#43; Prednisone and symptoms subsided. Then he went to the beach and symptoms came back and then he went back to the urgent care for the 2nd time when the symptoms came back and they prescribed him Valcyclovir 1gm BID &#43; Vaseline for the dryness around mouth. PCP informed patient to go see a dermatologist- he is scheduled to see the dermatologist in 6 weeks.  As of 4/12/21 patient does sees improvement in symptoms. I advised him to continue with the Valcyclovir and  Vaseline and stay out of the sun. Informed him if he gets worse then contact PCP or Dermatologist.

                                                8:30 am the day after the vaccine my lower right lip and lower right face swelled.  For 14 days every day I had a headache and cramps.  Daily fatigue.  One day it felt like a giant hand was squeezing me around the chest and back.  Random periods of nausea.  One day I had overwhelming fatigue, it took every ounce of my strength to lift myself.  It felt like something was laying on me pushing me down.  Another day my upper  right lip and upper right face swelled. Arm hurt at vaccine site.  All this went on over a period of 2 weeks.  To this day my upper right lip randomly swells.

Suffering from full body aches, headache (even my teeth and eyes hurt), chills, uncontrolled shaking, followed by uncontrolled sweating, muscle spasms, nausea, severe pain at injection site, swollen and painful lymph node in left armpit.  Little to no sleep that night.  In a fog all day Sunday, low grade fever just below 100.  Went to bed early (around 8:30pm) with similar but reduced symptoms.  Pain at injection site has subsided by now.  Shakes and chills are far less but still there.  Still sweating, really bad body aches, headache, swollen and tender lymph node under left arm.  Challenge sleeping but did a little better.  Today, Monday, still in a serious fog.  No energy.  Other symptoms appear to be subsiding

The day following my vaccine, my tinnitus became significantly more intense and started &#34;pulsating&#34;.  Best I can describe is the volume of the ringing pulses louder with my heartbeat.  In addition, I had two brief episodes of Vertigo within the past week whereas I normally get them no more than once or twice per year.   I&#39;m unsure at this time whether a second shot will make it unbearable.

The clinical course was reported as follows: This past week he has been feeling kind of crummy, says he&#39;s disabled, and can lose track. He says his brain is scrambled a little bit since he got hit, says he passed out, was dead for a while, states that affects him quite a bit, and he says he loses track. He says when he tells about that, he didn&#39;t know he got the first shot and it had a little place that hopes it didn&#39;t mess up. He states he put on small wounds, corcetin. States when they did the shot, says usually they&#39;ll make you hold, ask you to hold the cotton ball in place, says they get a Band-Aid on tight and push down, says they put compression so it doesn&#39;t leak. He states this was loose when he got home, it was leaking like a little bubble, a little fluid. When he washed it, he washed it off. Right close to it, there were two other places.  He states when they gave him some steroid cream, he put that on there it inflamed the places where you have bumps and dry skin and a cut and looks like a little cut. Says when he put cream, it got inflamed and angry. He stated he was watching Dr, and when she calls it a cyst or something is infected, she calls it angry. He says there was a bunch where they put the Band-Aid, and he put just a dab of corcetin, believe that&#39;s what he had when he put, took it off the first time, and it had two bigger places that were a scab. He says once he put 2 by 3 Band-Aids and left it on for a couple of days, says he did this several times since last year or two, says to try to clear some of this stuff up, don&#39;t scratch, says he did get an itch in that location when he got the shot. He didn&#39;t scratch, said he wanted to pull Band-Aid off and scratch but didn&#39;t do it. He says it cleared up but he&#39;s been feeling a little funny, just maybe a little sick to his stomach, dry mouth, stuff like that. He says he didn&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem, says he had that problem like after 3, 4, or 5 weeks and all of a sudden he has a little episode where he gets to feeling funny, says his judgement is off and the brain things get a little not right. He stated he then fell a lot, says he&#39;s been falling a bunch of times in the last week, he&#39;ll feel better and it won&#39;t bother him. He says it&#39;s a cycle he&#39;s gone through since he lost oxygen. He doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s anything, it&#39;s confusing, says it has so many symptoms, and when he read this it has so many symptoms.  Confirmed patient was referring to COVID vaccine. He states he hasn&#39;t had eczema then most of it, sometimes he&#39;ll scratch, it will build up like a scab and he&#39;ll scrape it off, put some of the ointment on there. but a band aid on top, leave it down for a couple of days, after a shower, a couple of showers, it comes off. He says it clears it up, says if it doesn&#39;t, just wash, wash it hard, it scrubs the scab off.  He states the worst thing he had was his toenails, he had to work on them, had fungus things push under the nail, under the side, and he cut it. He used cortisone 10 on it, says they always quit making something that works well, states you know how you get a yellow toenail. He says he&#39;s been putting Neosporin on it. Clarified corcetin is Cortizone 10, it is pretty strong stuff. He says he puts it on these places on his arm using Neosporin. Attempted to clarify that itching began after use of Cortizone 10, states nothing like that, says it did itch a few days after still a little bit, there were three little places under that Band-Aid where they put the shot. He ended up putting Neosporin right when he took that band aid off it was itching, says he washed it good, then put Neosporin on it, says it&#39;s cleared back up to its normal roughness.  For event itching, he states at first it was almost a scab, but it was not quite a scab, it was wet like a little bubble. After the scab, when he got ready to take, it was itchy after the band aid was on there a couple of days, he took a shower, washed it, and put more ointment on it. Each time he took the Band-Aid off, he washed it, washed his arm, and put the Band-Aid back on. He did the same again and it&#39;s gone away.  He states he is feeling a little bit bad, his stomach is a little bit bad. He hadn&#39;t checked it lately, when he gets a fever, says 98.6 is about a half point to a point high. He was really, really tired, says he slept and slept and slept. Says this is similar to the cycle that he goes through with his brain injury, says it&#39;s the same cycle he goes through. He also stated he lost so much weight laying in bed.
