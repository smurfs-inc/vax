About tens of consuming them, I felt like I was getting a cold and had to keep clearing my throat.  I told my wife I feel wired and she mentioned my right eye looked different.  In about two more minutes my right was swollen closed and speaking became difficult due to the swelling.  My wife drove me to Hospital and I received Epinephrine and Benadryl and fluids.

On 1/9 I had a vitrectomy and the tears in the retina were repaired as well.  I was advised the surgery had an 85% success rate but advised I will develop a cataract in the eye within 6months but within 6 weeks it developed. 2/22 I had the cataract removed  and a lense replaced in my right eye.

I advised when i presented for my 2nd shot and they told me they had other reports of that and that is was fine/safe for me to take the 2nd shot, but to wait in a holding area for 30 minutes after the shot.

A 60-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported)\ via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental issues since 1988. The patient stated &#34;I am calling about an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer shot. If you guys have anybody called in and find out if anybody is having the same. After the second shot, about a day after the shot, it was terrible. I got the shot last Tuesday and I feel like I am on drugs like I on &#39;some acid&#39; (not clarified). But I am not hallucinating, I am not seeing things, I am not hearing things, I just physically feel that way. Everything is kind of blurry, my vision is blurry and it&#39;s kind of hard to concentrate on television and stuff like that. It seems like some people are playing mind games with it but I don&#39;t think they have (further clarification unknown, hence not captured as event). I don&#39;t know if I hallucinated that or not (consumer was not sure). That&#39;s pretty much here I feel like I am on drugs constantly and it is just kind of scary. I have mental issues since 1988, I take psych meds but it seems whenever I take my psych meds (unspecified medications) I feel worst for couple of hours.&#34; Outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 (Lot Number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported) as single dose; and dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 (lot Number: EL8982, expiry date not reported) as single dose; for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eye surgery (he already had surgery once) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 then on 29Jan2021 the 2nd dose. He experienced side effects: floaters on 06Jan2021, and streaks of lightening then vision loss on 15Mar2021. There was a large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left and a detached retina on the left and a tear on the right retina on 19Mar2021. He already had surgery once. He will have 2nd surgery on the other eye. Reporter reported a follow up.  He can&#39;t see at all. He was recovering and has to lay on face for 2 weeks. Reporter stated she read about retina problems related to the virus but not to the vaccine, could not find information. Patient was a retail pharmacist. He deals with customers and several customers stated they had vision problems with the vaccine: double vision, loss of sight. &#34;There was a problem out there, but maybe they were not reporting it took reporter 2 hours to report so they may not have the time to sit there to report&#34;. Reporter knew they can&#39;t prove it was the vaccine that caused it. Reporter don&#39;t believe in coincidences. It seemed quite obvious to them it&#39;s related to the vaccine. Reporter appreciated all the help and stated they didn&#39;t have all the answers.  Reporter sure it was the vaccine because it was within hours after the first vaccine, but since there was no information regarding the sight problems related to the vaccine patient didn&#39;t think about it. Then the floaters got worse and started to block his vision, after the 2nd vaccine it was dramatically; within hours it was worse. He&#39;s never been sick in 36 years (2021). Patient hoped no one else has to deal with what he has to deal with. Patient also reported that on 10Feb2021, patient had section of vision lost in the left eye. It was then reported that patient was well versed in the virus and the vaccine. He was unable to speak on the phone at this time as he was recovering from surgery. Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 6Jan2021 and right away began seeing hundreds of floaters. He didn&#39;t correlate it to the vaccine but it didn&#39;t go away. Then he received the second dose of the vaccine on 29Jan2021 and within hours he thought he was going blind. He went to an optometrist 01Feb2021 who sloughed off the idea of it being related to the vaccine and diagnosed him with Posterior Vitreous Detachment. It was previously reported to Pfizer when he got the diagnosis of the PVD and all the events mentioned were previously reported. Reporter stated that from that day on the floaters got larger; the around 15Mar2021 he noticed every time he bent over he saw streaks of lightning; and he started to have a black hole, a loss of about 20% of his field of vision in the left eye. He went to another local optometrist 19Mar2021, who saw a large horseshoe tear in on left retina; and a detached left retina. The local optometrist sent him to a specialist and who verified the tear and the detachment and said the other retina in the right eye also has a small tear. Patient then had eye surgery, Monday at 0700AM, 22Mar2021 by outpatient surgery, to drain the fluid in his eye; insert a gas bubble and a silicone band to repair the retina; and did laser surgery on the tear. The specialist advised that the surgery damages the lens so he will need the lens replaced in the future. Now her patient has to lay down with his face down for 23 hours a day for two weeks and take 6-8 weeks off work. He had a doctor&#39;s visit yesterday and the doctor seemed satisfied with his progress but he can&#39;t see out of the eye, everything was cloudy so he doesn&#39;t know if the floaters are gone or the eye sight is recovered yet. The doctor was planning to do the right eye tear repair on Thursday 25Mar2021. Reporter had searched online to see if other people have this, but she can&#39;t seem to get the stories online about problems with the retina and the vaccine. She wanted this to be known and documented. Reporter was asking if company have information about if other people have had this. As per reporter, the events were not serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events reported. The patient required physician&#39;s office visit for the events reported. The patient had not recovered from section of vision lost in the left eye, large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left/tear on the right retina/small tear right eye, detached retina on the left, and floaters. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

Soft high-frequency crickets when my throat gets stressed, including hiccups, burping, stretching, sometimes yawning, muscle tensing, sometimes swallowing, stretching to wake up in the morning.  Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

                                                March 26, 2021: One week to the day after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine, my right eye suddenly had double vision and facial pain behind the right eye and all around the right eye (forehead, right temple, around to under the right eye on the cheek).  The right eye would not move correctly.    March 27, 2021: I went to see Optometrist.  He performed an eye exam with dilation and stated that the right eye was slow to track, and that the nerve behind the right eye was inflamed.  He recommended blood work, CT scan, and an MRI.    March 27, 2021 ? March 28, 2021: We went to ER at 9:00pm.  After waiting six hours, I finally was able to see an ER doctor.  No medical history was taken.  No bloodwork was done.  ER Dr performed a CT scan as Dr requested.  CT scan w/o contrast showed no masses or hemorrhages.  ER suggested to follow-up with Nuerology.  March 29, 2021: Went to Neurologist and he examined me.  He called in another Dr for a second opinion.  They stated that it may be a possible cranial nerve palsy and ordered multiple MRIs.    March 29, 2021: The earliest MRI appointment available was April 7, 2021.  Scheduled the MRI.  April 1, 2021: Had blood drawn at lab as Dr requested.  April 2, 2021: Two weeks from the day of COVID19 vaccine #2, my right eyelid would not open at all and the pain was getting worse.  April 5, 2021: Went to ER at 4:30am.  Triage nurse sent me straight to an ER room and within minutes an ER doctor was there.  Within 15 minutes after seeing the ER doctor, a Neurologist was examining me.  The nuero doctor was very thorough.  While waiting for the MRI, other neurologists and residents also examined me.  MRI scans with and without contrast were performed.  MRI images were clear ? no tumors, no aneurisms, and no stroke.  They concluded that it was a micro-vascular injury to cranial nerve #3.  (Similar to the Bells Palsy that I had in 2015.)  They prescribed gabapentin to help calm the nerve pain.  Follow-up will be with nuero-ophthalmologist.

He let me know he could not focus enough to read and retain anything.  He wanted to talk but couldn&#39;t find the words.  He remained very quiet but had no other symptoms of fever, pain, or anything else.  10 days post vaccine and he is doing better but still not feeling normal and not talking and holding conversations as usual.  He is able to answer appropriately .  The last two days he said all food is tasting bland without a lot of flavor.  He has taken a couple Tylenol  the last two days and drank Echinacea tea to try and make an improvement.  Is there data or information to give us any idea how long this could last?

Had first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 on Friday, January 29, 2021. On the following Sunday or Monday (2 or 3 days post vaccination), I noticed ringing in my ears. I have always had perfect hearing, no issues whatsoever. I knew nothing about tinnitus, so just figured it would go away. Days later, it hadn&#39;t gone away so did some research and wondered if it could be associated with the vaccine. Searched the web, but found nothing. Considered calling a hearing specialist (long story so will keep it short), but all info found said there was little that could be done, so did not make the call.  Since couldn&#39;t find relation to vaccine, received second dose on February 19, 2021 without any other issues. Tinnitus continues as originally noticed. Finally yesterday, I related the Covid vaccine to tinnitus after reading an article on J&amp;J&#39;s vaccine candidate that stated tinnitus had been seen as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials.

But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

A 63-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient medical history: no. Family medical history: no. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Vaccination facility type: hospital.

On Saturday, her brother was out shopping with her and stated that he felt very tired and run down and had a headache. He started running a high fever but stuck it out at home. On 04Apr2021, he was taken to the emergency room and admitted to the hospital. They had been running test after test and can&#39;t seem to find anything wrong. The doctor thought that it was some kind of reaction to the vaccine. The patient was still running a high fever over 102 and was still experiencing fatigue and headaches on and off, and horrible chills and night sweats. The patient wanted to wait until the day after Easter to go to the hospital but started experiencing new symptoms. He was starting to experience blurred vision. Was then taken to the emergency room. The fever went down with Tylenol but continued to go up again when Tylenol wears off. Temperature was 103.7 at one point and has mostly been over 102, stating that this morning was 102.7. It had been one week that he was still having these symptoms. It was strange because the patient was feeling all right for the first 2 weeks.

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.

I wasn&#39;t aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus. It is now on the verge of being debilitating in nature. It is now  pulsating and much louder, very difficult to ignore even during day time activities. Before my tinnitus was bilaterally equal, now I would say my right ear is louder than my left. But both are louder than before. Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 16:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9264) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included Chronic tinnitus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Patient had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms, Before the vaccines). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, also not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and no any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 first dose on 18Jan2021 (lot number: EK4176) on 18Jan2021 in left arm for covid-19 immunization. It was reported by the patient that: &#34;previous to the vaccines I had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms. I am a retired dentist. I was not aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus (on 21Feb2021). It is now on the verge of being debilitating in nature. It is now  pulsating and much louder, very difficult to ignore even during day time activities. Before my tinnitus was bilaterally equal, now I would say my right ear is louder than my left. But both are louder than before. Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.&#34; The outcome of the event was not recovered. The case was considered as serious (criteria-Disabling/Incapacitating: Yes). No treatment was received for the adverse event.   Additional information has been requested.

                                                I have chronic Lyme disease, with extreme symptoms of photosensitivity and photophobia.  12 years ago, I had a series of intravenous antibiotics for 9 months.  That halted the progression of the symptoms.  However, with the first injection of the Pfizer vaccine, I had an immediate and increasing photosensitivity/photophobia.  For example, my computer monitor was at 6% brightness.  I reset to 3% brightness, which is still too bright.  My concern is that the second injection due on February 12th may further increase the symptoms.  My Lyme doctor believes that the light sensitivity is perhaps coming from the thalamus.  Additionally, the injection seemed to increase my INR.

                                                According to staff....Recipient received the above vaccination and went to sit for 30 minutes.  He had already explained to the staff that he had had previous reactions to bee stings that required epinephrine so the nurse practitioner had  instructed him that he was to wait for 30 minutes vs the usual 15 minutes.  It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

A 66-year-old male received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that he was having some symptoms that has got worse and wanted to know if he should do something and wanted to know something what went with his eyes. His right eye was blood shot, it was red and daily amount of light that hits his eye was very painful so he had to keep his eyes closed to keep light from coming in so he won&#39;t be in pain. Patient was not able to give the lot number because it hurts too much when he tried to turn on the light to reach that (vaccine). Events started on Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination on the morning of 2/17/21 with no resulting initial sequelae other than injection site tenderness. Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine in my left arm on Jan. 23rd. I had no side effects at the time, other than a sore arm, as with any shot. However, two days later I lost all hearing in my left ear. I had no history of ear infections or other ear or hearing problems, except for wax buildup two or three times. On Jan. 26th, I saw an ENT. To my dismay, there was no wax. He prescribed the standard treatment of Prednisone for Sudden Idiopathic Hearing Loss. No change after the first round, so I had a second round, and also had the series of three ear injections with Dexamethasone. Had an MRI, as well, which was normal. A couple of weeks into all this, I began to have a bit of sound-generated static in my ear, and this continues today. (Fortunately, I?ve only had the most minor of tinnitus in that ear, and even it is pretty much gone now.)

The patient experienced transient bilateral blurry vision on 11Jan2021 11:20.  Caller is asking for recommendations regarding the 2nd dose for the patient who experienced blurriness of vision. Caller reporting a patient who received the first dose of the Vaccine yesterday (11Jan2021) and developed transient bilateral blurry vision at 11:00am, 20-30 mins after the dose. He said that it was resolved within 18-24 hrs after. He is asking if there were any reports of this in the clinical trial. It was further reported that caller is calling about the COVID vaccine. He says he was curious, he is a clinical director in (and he was calling to report or see if anyone had reported this. The patient received his first dose of the vaccine yesterday (11Jan2021) and for less than 24 hours had transient bilateral blurry vision. He says by the second day it had totally resolved. It started about 20 minutes after the first dose and resolved within 24 hours. He did not think it met criteria to report but he wondered if they would like to him report that and see if anyone had seen that at all. Event began on 11Jan2021 about 15-20 minutes after the vaccine was given and was resolved completely within 24 hours. For the dose, he believed the patient received 0.3 ml, whatever the standard dose is. He thought the Pfizer one is 0.3 ml. He says the nurses do that he just does the medical screening but he thinks the Pfizer one is 0.3 ml and (name) is 0.5 ml but he is older so he may be wrong. No further information provided. For the anatomical location of administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, he stated it was on one of the deltoids, he is not sure which. Vaccination Facility Type was outpatient clinic. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, they screen for those and he has not had any other vaccines for at least 2 weeks. It was further reported that vaccine given roughly about 11 AM and the symptoms began 11:20 AM. He called the patient this morning at 9:30 AM and he said the blurry had resolved. He says he spoke with the patient&#39;s wife and she asked the patient if it was resolved and he said yes. They did not provide the caller with the time that the blurry vision resolved. Caller says he did send the patient to their in house optometrist for an exam and the exam was unremarkable by the optometrist. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He also wanted to know if they could advise whether or not to give the second dose. The outcome of the event was recovered on 12Jan2021.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

The patient was wondering if he hold the current record for the number of days consecutive for a person to have adverse reaction to the second vaccine because it was over a week and he could not move out of his bed. That almost killed him. His vision was also blurred. His weight was dropping rather rapidly because he was not able to eat. The outcome of the events was unknown.

There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021.

Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each.

The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol.

No tachycardia as he was checking his Apple Watch and no other symptoms.  ? 10:20 he drove home and called his wife can kept her on the call as he drove. He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

Also he was diagnosed with, it is 4 words and then leukemia and he had an appointment with doctor to get his blood drawn every 2 weeks. The neurosurgeon that did surgery on him on 09Jan2021 at 4 am said that his carotid artery in his neck was plugged and he went in and cleaned it out and put in a stent and he said that his carotid artery was plugged all the way to his temple and he tried to get that out and couldn&#39;t. He had his stroke at 8PM on the 08Jan2021. They had dinner at 5 pm and at 6pm they were sitting on the couch and all of sudden he started slurring his words and he said his mouth felt like someone give him Novocain and then he had his arm around her and all of sudden it felt like he was choking her so she grabbed his hand and his fingers started rolling up, started closing up tight so she started playing with his fingers and then he went out in the kitchen and then he hit the floor and she called # and the paramedics came up there. When they got there he could squeeze both hands and lift both feet by that time it was 7:30, they had just brought in a chair, by time they got done bringing in the chair they realized his left side was becoming paralyzed and so they had to go back and get the stretcher so they were there for about 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes then they headed up the hill toward the hospital at about 8pm and they came in and gave anti-blood clotting medicine and took him for a scan with dye, they found he still had a blockage on his brain so at 2AM on the 9th they came in with a medical helicopter and flew him to (institution name withheld) in (place name withheld) and they did an MRI on and seen his carotid blockage there so he had emergency surgery at from # that morning of the 09Jan2021 at (institution name withheld) and he was in ICU from Saturday until a week ago at 3 oclock 13Jan2021 he was placed in a regular room and on the 19Jan2021 at 7:30PM he was moved (hospital name) in (place name withheld) for 14 days having 15 hours per day of therapy for a week and then he will go to (place name withheld) (rehab name withheld) and he could be there 2-3 weeks.

The outcome of the events was unknown.

I have not been to a doctor at this point because the blisters appear to be healing so the blisters have not been diaganosed as being a covid vaccine reaction.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all; he felt fullness in his right ear; sore left arm where he got injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 71-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 09:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization (Age at vaccination: 71 years). Medical history included transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode from Mar2021, blocked carotid artery on his left side and tinnitus (had a history of Tinnitus in his left ear for about 4 years but he could hear). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BAYER ASPIRIN) for carotid artery blockage. The reporter stated that the patient was completely deaf in his left ear and had hearing loss on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he had walked straight into half of a wall because he was so off kilted on 27Mar2021 . The wife thinks the patient is not hearing well out of his right ear on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he is shrinking a little and the patient has gained weight on an unspecified date. The reporter also says that she thought that her husband&#39;s side effects started a little late after the vaccine date, has that been reported? Her husband had made the mistake of getting on the internet even though she said not to do that. She jokingly says that her husband is like a medical manual and he thinks that he is going to die from everything. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included height: shrinking and weight: gained on an unspecified date and CAT scan and MRI: Transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode on Mar2021. Outcome of the event deafness and hearing decreased was not recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

It is like cicada singing at both of your ears constantly, none stop, and annoying. It keeps happening since that day.  The strange thing is it will last for 2 days, then disappeared, then come back again one or one and half day.

He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

Yesterday, February 2nd, in  the late afternoon I became very red and itchy and my tongue swelled. I went to  the emergency room where they gave me sodium chloride, Benadryl,  Pepcid and 2 &#34;epi&#34; shots. After about 4 hours I was sent home. Could that have  been a reaction to my Covid vaccine? Today I am tired but fine and swelling is  gone. I had told the person who scheduled my first shot and the person who  vaccinated me that I was taking Skyrizi injections for psoriasis and had my  last injection of Skyrizi on Dec 15.&#34;

Some time after receiving the first dose, I noticed a subtle but definite strange feeling all around my mouth and tongue, like a &#34;film&#34; over everything. I also noticed a loss of taste. I suffered from anosmia and dysgeusia many years ago, but through medical intervention, I gained back over 90% of smell and 80% of taste. Now I&#39;ve noticed more loss of taste again, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence that it&#39;s happened while getting vaccinated. I just hope that I regain taste (which is only 45-50% now maybe) as time goes by.

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient mentioned that he received his 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine and 5 minutes after, they noticed a blood vessel had busted in his right eye, the same side where he got injected on his right arm. He thinks some blood had dried in his eyes and it was red that afternoon and the next day. He had a right eye busted blood vessel and it turned red. The whole white turned red. They watched him for another 15 minutes and it just stayed red. After a few days, the redness went away, but it left floaters in his right eye. He mentioned that he got 50-150 floaters in his right eye. He has a bunch of black floaters. Floaters are not directly in his sight, but he can see them all around. It has not impaired his sight. If they move in his line of sight, he can still see through them. He did not take second shot. He was scared to because he would get more floaters. It has been 3 weeks already and he still has floaters and it has not changed. Second shot was scheduled for 19Mar2021. Two weeks after first and a week before second one, he decided he did not want to get second shot. Fatigue got better 7 days after. Taste and smell took longer to return but came back since then. He takes regular medications for high blood pressure and did not feel they were relevant. Headache comes and goes but improved. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event &#39;black floaters in right eye&#39; was not recovered and outcome of the other events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.
