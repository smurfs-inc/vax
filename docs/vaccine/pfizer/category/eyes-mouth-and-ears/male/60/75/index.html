                                                One week of the vaccine, while having some coffee and cookies. About tens of consuming them, I felt like I was getting a cold and had to keep clearing my throat.  I told my wife I feel wired and she mentioned my right eye looked different.  In about two more minutes my right was swollen closed and speaking became difficult due to the swelling.  My wife drove me to Hospital and I received Epinephrine and Benadryl and fluids.

Now I still have a BIG thing in field of vision making it hard to see and &#34;thousands&#34; of tiny black floaters.  Hard to see out of right eye.

The next day Thursday I had a visual deficite in my eye along with the floaters.  By Friday evening I went up to see the eye doctor while at work and was advised I had 5 tears to the retina of my right eye and was advised it needs to be repaired immediately. On 1/9 I had a vitrectomy and the tears in the retina were repaired as well.  I was advised the surgery had an 85% success rate but advised I will develop a cataract in the eye within 6months but within 6 weeks it developed. 2/22 I had the cataract removed  and a lense replaced in my right eye.

She diagnosed &#34;Swollen sub-mandibular &amp; pre-auricular lymphatic nodes.&#34;  I am being treated with: 1) Erythromycin Ophth Oint 3.5GM 2) Prednisolone AC 1% Ophth Susp 5ML 3) Pataday  Doctor believes that my viral infection might be a result of the Covid 19 vaccine, and gives assurance that her treatment will resolve issues. She is unsure whether, or not, I am considered contagious during this time? Inquiries at the college were unfruitful.   I hope my reporting this is not a violation in any way. Many thanks.

                                                I got my second Pfizer COVID vaccine on Friday February 26. On Saturday February 27 I started getting a droopy lip and a droopy eye lid on the ight side of my face.  I went to my doctor on Monday March 1 and after and examination and a CT scan (to eliminate other things), I was diagnosed with Bell?s Palsy. I am now on steroids and antiviral medication.  I still have Bell&#39;s Palsy at this time,

                                                Tinnitus has been going on in top section of my head since about 3 hours after the vaccine.  I believe I have a compromised blood brain barrier due to the fact that I had taken prescribed anti inflammatory for 15 years for my lower back pain. So now if I take anything with anti inflammatory effects I get tinnitus but it goes away soon afterward, depending on strength of dose.  It has been 4 days now with no sign of relief. I am eating a low salicylate diet right now to help my body process any anti inflammatory.

                                                I have had minor tinnitus for years.  It was noticeable when I was going to sleep, but had never bothered me during the day.  After getting my first vaccination it has gotten much worse.  It makes it hard to get to sleep and hard to concentrate on work during the day.

                                                I received my vaccine on a Tuesday morning, and five days later on Sunday morning I woke up with very swollen checks--my head looked like a pumpkin.  When my girlfriend saw me in the afternoon, she said, &#34;I&#39;m taking you to the emergency room!&#34;  But, I told her that I had no fever and no other symptoms, so we should wait.  The swelling was bad enough that my jaws ached and my cheeks felt like they were going to burst, but if I didn&#39;t chew any food, the swelling would subside slightly, and my jaws would stop aching.   I read online that people with botox who get the vaccine can have facial swelling and a 24 hour course of benadryl will knock down the swelling.  I have never had botox injections, but I took some benadryl for two days, which made me feel really tired.  I ate only soup and yogurt, so that I didn&#39;t have to chew any food.   I don&#39;t know if the benadryl had any effect, but over about 5 days, the swelling subsided, then I could eat again without causing my jaws to swell up.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported)\ via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental issues since 1988. The patient stated &#34;I am calling about an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer shot. If you guys have anybody called in and find out if anybody is having the same. After the second shot, about a day after the shot, it was terrible. I got the shot last Tuesday and I feel like I am on drugs like I on &#39;some acid&#39; (not clarified). But I am not hallucinating, I am not seeing things, I am not hearing things, I just physically feel that way. Everything is kind of blurry, my vision is blurry and it&#39;s kind of hard to concentrate on television and stuff like that. It seems like some people are playing mind games with it but I don&#39;t think they have (further clarification unknown, hence not captured as event). I don&#39;t know if I hallucinated that or not (consumer was not sure). That&#39;s pretty much here I feel like I am on drugs constantly and it is just kind of scary. I have mental issues since 1988, I take psych meds but it seems whenever I take my psych meds (unspecified medications) I feel worst for couple of hours.&#34; Outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left/tear on the right retina/small tear right eye; detached retina on the left; vision loss/can&#39;t see at all/thought he was going blind; streaks of lightening; section of vision lost in the left eye; Posterior Vitreous Detachment; floaters; sick; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 60-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 (Lot Number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported) as single dose; and dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 (lot Number: EL8982, expiry date not reported) as single dose; for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eye surgery (he already had surgery once) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 then on 29Jan2021 the 2nd dose. He experienced side effects: floaters on 06Jan2021, and streaks of lightening then vision loss on 15Mar2021. There was a large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left and a detached retina on the left and a tear on the right retina on 19Mar2021. He already had surgery once. He will have 2nd surgery on the other eye. Reporter reported a follow up.  He can&#39;t see at all. He was recovering and has to lay on face for 2 weeks. Reporter stated she read about retina problems related to the virus but not to the vaccine, could not find information. Patient was a retail pharmacist. He deals with customers and several customers stated they had vision problems with the vaccine: double vision, loss of sight. &#34;There was a problem out there, but maybe they were not reporting it took reporter 2 hours to report so they may not have the time to sit there to report&#34;. Reporter knew they can&#39;t prove it was the vaccine that caused it. Reporter don&#39;t believe in coincidences. It seemed quite obvious to them it&#39;s related to the vaccine. Reporter appreciated all the help and stated they didn&#39;t have all the answers.  Reporter sure it was the vaccine because it was within hours after the first vaccine, but since there was no information regarding the sight problems related to the vaccine patient didn&#39;t think about it. Then the floaters got worse and started to block his vision, after the 2nd vaccine it was dramatically; within hours it was worse. He&#39;s never been sick in 36 years (2021). Patient hoped no one else has to deal with what he has to deal with. Patient also reported that on 10Feb2021, patient had section of vision lost in the left eye. It was then reported that patient was well versed in the virus and the vaccine. He was unable to speak on the phone at this time as he was recovering from surgery. Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 6Jan2021 and right away began seeing hundreds of floaters. He didn&#39;t correlate it to the vaccine but it didn&#39;t go away. Then he received the second dose of the vaccine on 29Jan2021 and within hours he thought he was going blind. He went to an optometrist 01Feb2021 who sloughed off the idea of it being related to the vaccine and diagnosed him with Posterior Vitreous Detachment. It was previously reported to Pfizer when he got the diagnosis of the PVD and all the events mentioned were previously reported. Reporter stated that from that day on the floaters got larger; the around 15Mar2021 he noticed every time he bent over he saw streaks of lightning; and he started to have a black hole, a loss of about 20% of his field of vision in the left eye. He went to another local optometrist 19Mar2021, who saw a large horseshoe tear in on left retina; and a detached left retina. The local optometrist sent him to a specialist and who verified the tear and the detachment and said the other retina in the right eye also has a small tear. Patient then had eye surgery, Monday at 0700AM, 22Mar2021 by outpatient surgery, to drain the fluid in his eye; insert a gas bubble and a silicone band to repair the retina; and did laser surgery on the tear. The specialist advised that the surgery damages the lens so he will need the lens replaced in the future. Now her patient has to lay down with his face down for 23 hours a day for two weeks and take 6-8 weeks off work. He had a doctor&#39;s visit yesterday and the doctor seemed satisfied with his progress but he can&#39;t see out of the eye, everything was cloudy so he doesn&#39;t know if the floaters are gone or the eye sight is recovered yet. The doctor was planning to do the right eye tear repair on Thursday 25Mar2021. Reporter had searched online to see if other people have this, but she can&#39;t seem to get the stories online about problems with the retina and the vaccine. She wanted this to be known and documented. Reporter was asking if company have information about if other people have had this. As per reporter, the events were not serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events reported. The patient required physician&#39;s office visit for the events reported. The patient had not recovered from section of vision lost in the left eye, large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left/tear on the right retina/small tear right eye, detached retina on the left, and floaters. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

                                                Tinnitus (high pitched tone) in right ear started the morning after vaccination and has continued to date. Noticeable and annoying but tolerable. Note I&#39;ve had tinnitus a few times in the past, though I believe this is the longest it&#39;s persisted.

Tinnitus has decreased in intensity, but there was a sudden increase of tinnitus the evening of 08 April 2021, the same day that I received the 2nd vaccine dose. Hearing loss in right continues. Minor hearing loss in left ear was detected with audiology testing also.

                                                My tinnitus symptoms have been raging since I have received my second dose of phizer covid-19 vacination.   I can not say 100% that the vacine is the the sole reason for the extreme symptoms  but can tie nothing else to the change. The ringing, screeching and high pitch sounds are louder than I have ever e,peri encased in my 15 years with tinnitus.   I TS constant,  unnerving,  stressful,  and never ending.  Difficult to impossible to sleep  and if I do happen to fall asleep the symptoms wake me up within an hour.  Kinda at my wits end at this piint.

In the last week, twice I was awakened by it in the middle of the night and was not able to fall back to sleep because it is so loud. In the past, I never heard it during the day, but now it is very loud even in the daytime. This is very serious. Not being able to sleep and rest at night is very hard to cope during the day. I&#39;m not sure what to do as there is no cure for this tinnitus.

Tried to use v-safe to report this reaction, but it has my first dose recorded as 4/14 , which is actually date of second dose (no way to correct in system). Had no reaction at all to second shot until 4/29, while on a 4-hour airline flight.  I thought it was just the plane noise or pressurization that was causing ringing in my ears. It came and went over the last 48 hours, but has been pretty consistently ?on? today. Went online to check tinnitus and vaccines and I see this has been reported by others. Hope it goes away soon!

Went to my eye doctor on 4/26/2021 who diagnosed condition as Panuveitis. My eye doctor prescribed Prednisolone AC 1% Eye Drops (1 drop into right eye four times daily). Treatment with Prednisolone eye drops is current with moderate improvement. I continue to have intermittent pain with blurred vision as of this writing.

In a completely quiet room, I continue to hear it throughout the day and night after one week.

                                                Immediately after the injection I felt a warm sensation flowing through my body and my head felt warm but I did not have a temperature.  This subsided within 20 minutes.    Prior to the vaccination I had slight Tinnitus on a scale of 1-10 I would say it was a 2.  I had no trouble sleeping at night and did not use any sound machines to mask the tinnitus. I would characterize myself as a great sleeper.   About 48 hours after the vaccination in my left ear my Tinnitus went from a 2 to a 5.  Now to sleep I must run a fan or noise machine to mask the tinnitus and sometimes have to take benadryl or Tylenol PM to sleep.

                                                Per triage notes on 4/21/21: Pt had his 2nd COVID vaccine today at 0800. At 0900 developed lip swelling. Took two doses of Benadryl and has now developed chest tightness and throat swelling. Per doctor&#39;s notes: Patient is a very pleasant 60-year-old gentleman who comes in for evaluation after a possible allergic reaction today, possibly related to a second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine that he got at 8 AM this morning.  About an hour later he started to feel flushed.  He felt like his face was warm and his ears were warm.  He started to feel like the inside of his mouth had filled with a rubber ball.  His tongue felt full and he started noticed progressively that he felt like he was having difficulty swallowing.  States that he never actually had any lip swelling, contrary to the triage note, just felt funny in the interior of his mouth.  Did feel like his tongue was slightly swollen, both based on the fact that it felt &#34;thick&#34; when he was talking, and on direct inspection, as well.  Took 50 mg of Benadryl around the time that his symptoms started, and lay down to nap for a little while.  When he woke up he was still feeling like he was having more difficulty swallowing.  He also felt like his face was a little bit puffy, prickly under each eye.  He also felt like he had a blotchy rash on his chest and upper back, which his wife corroborates.  He felt like his chest was a little bit tight and that something was heavy on his chest, though he was not wheezing or acutely short of breath, per se.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl at about 2:15 PM, and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation.  Currently still has a little bit of chest tightness and throat tightness.  He feels flushed.  Symptoms have not worsened, but they have not completely resolved, either.  He has had anaphylaxis in the past and has had to be admitted to the hospital.  And this was in relation to taking doxycycline, it sounds like. Patient presented again to the ED on 4/22/21 with the same symptoms. He was admitted with anaphylaxis. Per ED notes, also diagnosed with Angioedema, improved. Likely related to second covid vaccine. Cant rule out secondary to Lisinopril.

                                                Relatively minor, but troubling.  The adverse effect was that my teeth sensitivity to cold became severe enough that I could not drink any fluids directly from the refrigerator or any drinks with ice.  I have never had cold sensitivity with the teeth before. This side effect  went away gradually and is mostly gone now, which is about 6 weeks after the first shot.  I had no additional side affects from the second shot.

On the 23rd of April, I was taken to the ER. The ER thought I was having a stroke. They did a lot of procedures. They determined there was not nerve or brain damage as to why I had facial numbness.  All of the test I had proved nothing. They could not find anything. The facial palsy persisted. It has been identified as trigeminal neuralgia. I have been given many medications to deal with this facial numbness. I was given carbamazepine for facial numbness and then switched to pregabalin for trigeminal neuralgia. Sometimes its a pain and burning sensation down my cheek, underneath my cheek, and towards the nose. Sometimes above the eyebrow, my eyelid would twitch. The numbness is getting stronger, and it gets worse each week than the previous week before.

Stacked on top, was like a snake looking thing.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 60-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: FA6780) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Jul2021 at 12:30 (age at vaccination 60-years-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) one pill, once a day for atopic allergies (It was working perfect. Patient had been taking for about two years). Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were reported as none. On 15Jul2021, around 00:15 to 00:30, patient started to get a migraine headache. He normally did not get migraines or headaches. His head was still hurting on the right side. The pain started on the right back side of his neck. Then it moved to the cortex of his brain, just on the right side. It spilled into the right side of his brain. After he saw things, then his head was hurting so bad. He could feel the right side of his brain. It got terrible to the point that his right eye lost vision. His vision did not go black, it went white. The weird thing was that he could see two to three feet in front of him. He saw little pyramids connected together, then it had a thing with a pyramid shaped head at the edge of it. He really could see nothing, but it was clear at the same time, and he could still see the light. At first, it got whiter, and then it got black and white. Stacked on top, was like a snake looking thing. It was circling, and then moving back and forth, and then turned into an S. It straightened up and turned its head towards him. Then it started fading away. He had to leave his job because his head was hurting. He felt it on the right side of his brain. He was driving home, and it started happening again. He held his right hand over his right eye, and he could still see it. He knew that it was not an illusion, it was in his head. He was like what the hell was going on.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

Soft high-frequency crickets when my throat gets stressed, including hiccups, burping, stretching, sometimes yawning, muscle tensing, sometimes swallowing, stretching to wake up in the morning.  Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

                                                tinnitus - started at 2nd shot and is still continuing. It is significant enough to get medical treatment and is very annoying. Over Easter I was with family, the TV was on and people were talking. I had significant trouble understanding people talking to me.  I had significant joint pain of the left hand, knee&#39;s, and ankles which has decreased. I had headaches which have decreased but still continue

                                                March 26, 2021: One week to the day after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine, my right eye suddenly had double vision and facial pain behind the right eye and all around the right eye (forehead, right temple, around to under the right eye on the cheek).  The right eye would not move correctly.    March 27, 2021: I went to see Optometrist.  He performed an eye exam with dilation and stated that the right eye was slow to track, and that the nerve behind the right eye was inflamed.  He recommended blood work, CT scan, and an MRI.    March 27, 2021 ? March 28, 2021: We went to ER at 9:00pm.  After waiting six hours, I finally was able to see an ER doctor.  No medical history was taken.  No bloodwork was done.  ER Dr performed a CT scan as Dr requested.  CT scan w/o contrast showed no masses or hemorrhages.  ER suggested to follow-up with Nuerology.  March 29, 2021: Went to Neurologist and he examined me.  He called in another Dr for a second opinion.  They stated that it may be a possible cranial nerve palsy and ordered multiple MRIs.    March 29, 2021: The earliest MRI appointment available was April 7, 2021.  Scheduled the MRI.  April 1, 2021: Had blood drawn at lab as Dr requested.  April 2, 2021: Two weeks from the day of COVID19 vaccine #2, my right eyelid would not open at all and the pain was getting worse.  April 5, 2021: Went to ER at 4:30am.  Triage nurse sent me straight to an ER room and within minutes an ER doctor was there.  Within 15 minutes after seeing the ER doctor, a Neurologist was examining me.  The nuero doctor was very thorough.  While waiting for the MRI, other neurologists and residents also examined me.  MRI scans with and without contrast were performed.  MRI images were clear ? no tumors, no aneurisms, and no stroke.  They concluded that it was a micro-vascular injury to cranial nerve #3.  (Similar to the Bells Palsy that I had in 2015.)  They prescribed gabapentin to help calm the nerve pain.  Follow-up will be with nuero-ophthalmologist.

He had the vaccine around 11 am and later that evening, he is not positive of the time but between 7-9 pm, he developed severe swelling of his face and lips and tongue, he also felt nauseated.  He called EMS and they found his bp to be low.  He was not given EPI.  His symptoms resolved on their own but reoccured the following evening; he went to ER and was monitored there; he was not given EPI at the ER.  He was not admitted to the hospital.  Symptoms have not reoccured and he is asymptomatic at this time.   He was not sure if this was releated to the vaccine, but could not identify any new environmental or food items that would have triggered the reaction.

                                                This patient came in to the community center to receive his 2nd dose of his Pfizer vaccine at approx 10:06am. At approx 10 minutes after sitting in the observation area, the patient started to fee hot, dizzy, some tunneled vision and nausea. This attendee did not have any sort of reaction to his first dose. This was brought to the attention of one of the observing staff members. This nurse,  was called over to the patient. The attendee was asked to lay down on the cot provided and we elevated his legs. RN, measured his vital signs: bp 110/70, HR: 60, Resp 16, O2 97%. This patient denied any shortness of breath. Lung sounds were clear, and no wheezing or rhonchi were observed. This patient stated he has a history of Asthma and took his asthma medications this morning as normally directed. This patient was directed to lay down for approx 10 minutes, then stated he felt much better and wanted to sit up and take a sip of water. The attendee tolerated the water well. This nurse, advised for this attendee to stay for another 10 minutes until he had no symptoms present. The patient quickly felt better and stated that his wife was out in the car and would be driving him home. This nurse advised for him to go to the Emergency Room if he felt any of these symptoms again.

                                                On Friday, April 23/ 2021 @4PM I began to feel pressure built up on my chest. @ 4:15 the pressure also built up on my neck. I was short of breath and I can feel the heartbeat way too high. I recall the person that gave me the first Pfizer shot to get ready for side effects after the second shot. @ 4:30pm the pressure was all over the back, the chest and the neck. Making things worse the jaw and lower teeth were also in extreme pain.  I laid down on the sofa and must have passed out. 20 minutes later I began to come around but I was way weak and the heart beat was beginning to relax. The body pressure was present till 6pm I did not know what to do at that time other than take a nap. I was not able to eat any food until Saturday 6PM.

After consulting a week later with my family doctor, he mentioned the possibility of tinnitus and we have an appointment set with an ear/nose/throat specialist on May 3rd.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right upper arm on 27Apr2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EWO171; Expiration Date: Aug2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history including hearing was about 80 percent in the left ear/loss of 20-30 percent which started 10 years ago when the patient was 51. The patient has no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. After receiving a dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 27Apr2021, the patient experienced hearing loss in his left ear, it was barely noticeable but today (04May2021 12:00) there was a dramatic shift and he experienced hearing loss on both ears, it was instantaneous. The patient wanted to know if there are any reports of hearing loss and when could it go away. He has a hearing issue in his left ear that he has had, his hearing was about 80 percent in the left ear and in the right ear it was a 100 percent. Today, at noon he has almost lost his hearing in his left ear and his right ear seems like there is water in there or it is underwater. His left ear sounds like everything is echoing but, he can hear the call handler just fine. His right ear was perfect and now it is messed up. He is worried about that. The patient wonders why that happened and why did they both go. He reported that the shot may have had something to do with it and if it does, what should he do or maybe he is just getting old. He cannot hear in the left ear much; he was just testing it while on hold listening to the music to see how much he had. He felt like there is water in it, not a little, a lot of water and it echoes a little bit and seemed like it&#39;s underwater. Started 10 years ago when he was 51, he lost 20-30 percent and it stopped as far as he could tell. He did not get checked out then because he could hear clearly. Today at 12 pm, and it was not gradual, it was like turning a light on, immediately things were muffled. Even when he was putting his hands over his ears, there was like an echo. He was on the phone with his wife at the time. He did not know what happened, so, he went to work, and nothing is changed. He told her something just happened to his ears. He thought of doing something in the meantime and not trying to wait for it to get better. Right ear feels like it is underwater, maybe the left ear is affecting the right the or the weaker ear is being affected more. The right ear is the stronger ear over the left ear. That is what bothering him. His weaker ear is being affected more than his good ear, which his right ear has always been the stronger ear and he never had problems before with his right ear. It was a dramatic switch today at 12pm and his ears have been that way ever since. The left ear feels like its underwater, so much even if he blocks that ear with his finger or his palm. Still there is something going on in both ears. He did not notice the right ear because the other ear was such a shock and he was just dealing with that. He noticed the right side too after trying to see if he could hear out of the left. He had no baseline to go off of for sure or a history. No baseline to go from other than this hearing change of event, which may be totally him. He wanted to see if there is anything related to this because it was so dramatic. The events were not treated. The outcome of the event &#34;experienced hearing loss in his left ear/hearing loss on both ears&#34; was not recovered while the other events were unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Caller states starting out his taste was completely gone, his first cup of coffee about killed him, it tasted so bad. Caller states he has dryness in the mouth every day and he was drinking more water. Caller state he normally drinks a lot but this is more. Caller states his voice has changed to raspy most of the time and his urine has a smell. Caller states it was not like when he eats asparagus but another smell he hasn&#39;t had before. Caller states it started the morning after on 09Jun2021. Caller states his coffee is not back to normal taste yet, it still just tastes weird. Caller states he was also lethargic but that has improved some. Caller states he figured that out because he usually only has 1 cup of coffee and he was having 2-3 cups so he could stay focused and work, it was kind of weird. He also states he had a metallic taste in the mouth and for a while he had to brush his teeth 5 times a day. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I was immediately confused about where I was at, when leaving the vaccination site.  I immediately felt flush with red splotches on my face.  I came home and took a nap just to sleep it off.  I woke up with severe tinnitus, a headache, and brain fog.  Both the tinnitus and headaches have only gotten worse.  The flush feeling, (suspecting higher blood pressure than usual), comes and goes with more frequency as time goes by.  The ?brain fog? has been more like brain damage.  At first, I just couldn?t think.  My ability to think has slowly improved, but it is no where near the same as my abilities prior to the vaccine.  My memory has been impaired, both long term and short term.   My hand/eye coordination has been impaired.      Prior to the vaccine, I didn?t feel my age.  After the vaccine I felt like I aged 25 years in a week.   I need to figure out what is going on inside my head, and what can be done about it.  The degeneration is a serious concern.  Both in the severity of the adverse reactions, and in the permanence of the damage.  This will be devastating if I?m entering early stages of dementia, decades before the course of natural causes of aging.

                                                Developed tinnitus in both ears.; Had trouble sleeping the past few weeks but am sleeping better; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 61-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN) in the arm right on 12Mar2021 at 20:00 (at the age of 61-years-old) and second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN) in the arm right on 02Apr2021 at 17:15 (at the age of 61-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cholesterol and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) 40mg and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) 5mg from an unknown date. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. After receiving the first dose on 12March2021, the patient developed tinnitus in both ears late Sunday on 21March2021 into early Monday 22March2021. The patient started to take some over the counter supplements to help. The patient&#39;s right ear was normal as of 06April2021 but had slight tinnitus in the left ear. The right tinnitus had resolved several days ago. The patient felt that the left ear was bit better as ringing can dissipate during different times of the day. The patient had trouble sleeping for the past few weeks but was able to sleep better at the time of reporting. The patient was still trying to get the left ear line the right. The patient would clean the ears daily with Q-tips (outer areas) and would always see wax and the weirdest thing was that there was no ear wax. The patient got nothing and no wax at all even if the ears were not cleaned for days which was very, very strange. The events did not result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and emergency room/department or urgent care. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of tinnitus, trouble sleeping and included treatment with over-the-counter herbs with ginkgo biloba (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and SYNAPSE XT from 22Mar2021 to unknown date. The clinical outcome of the events tinnitus in ears and difficulty sleeping were recovering at the time of this report.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

It got worse over the New Year&#39;s weekend, and now seems to be stabilized as a constant ringing.  I will be making an appointment this coming week to have it investigated, but wanted to get the preliminary information to you. I have experienced a much lesser degree of tinnitus in the past, always a momentary transient event, not nearly as loud as I am currently experiencing.

On the second day I started having problems with my vision in my left eye, I went blind for 20minutes. When I did get my Vision back I got and slight headache.  About 3am in the morning, I woke up like someone hit me in the head with a hammer. After that every second or third day the pain would come back and it would be worse, it brought tears to my eyes. I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I&#39;m not having them as much. I&#39;m calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.

Steroids and nasal spray for 3 days to no relief. Started antibiotics on 04/15.  As of now at 10:36am on 04/16 no let up in all symptoms!

                                                Woke up next morning, 04/09, after receiving 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. Started as feeling like a head cold. Some chills etc. by the time I went to work right side hearing was severely affected with what sounded like phase shifter in my head. No relief through weekend, too dangerous to work due to my job in a busy kitchen. Saw my Dr. on Tuesday 04/13. Treated as an ear infection. 3 day steroid with nasal spray. No relief. By now the ringing, whooshing, roaring and chirping in my right side are extremely disorienting! Started antibiotics on 04/15 with wait and see effectiveness.  Today is 04/16 at 10:15am. To date no relief of symptoms.

Patient fell twice within first week of shot.  He was extremely weak/unstable.  He was starting to walk without his cane or walker.  He could no longer walk on his own. He refused to talk because he was drooling all the time.  There was little to no drooling before first shot. All the progress he made in the last 6 months is gone.  He is just starting to feel like himself. Patient&#39;s second Pfizer shot was cancelled and will not be rescheduled.

                                                Second injection on a Friday.  Starting Sunday, 4/18, I have had waxing and waning hives - most pronounced at night but also periodically throughout the day.  I also had a swollen lip when I woke Tuesday morning, 4/20/21.  The swollen lip returned to normal after about two hours and has not returned.  I still have recurring hives that wax and wane throughout the day and at night.  I do not consider the hives to be a heavy rash.  They are itchy enough today that I took a Benadryl.  I would have taken one last night, but I had to drive 3 hours to a funeral today.     In addition, following the first vaccination (on 3/26/21), I had a swollen lip that night.    I did not consider attributing any of the foregoing symptoms to the vaccine until I read about symptoms at about 2 am this morning.  The fact sheet given to me when I got the vaccination really doesn&#39;t highlight the potential for a swollen lip or the onset of hives a couple days after the injection.  I did not have any immediate reaction to the injection (i.e., none during the 15 minute waiting period following either shot).

The ringing, buzzing and whistling sounds have become louder and very difficult to tolerate affecting my sleep and some other daily  resting activities. I informed my doctor and was advise to do Audiology test and discuss with ENT specialist.

                                                Began noticing rapid heart rate and dizziness approximately one hour after getting first dose of COVID vaccine.  Symptoms continued and worsened over next two weeks. Went to ER on April 11th, 2021, due to immense head pressure, BP over 200, and ringing in ears. My blood pressure and heart rate were checked at ER and were high, but came down after laying down for a while. I was given blood pressure medication, Amlodipine, 10 mg tablets. Medication had minor positive effects but symptoms continued to get worse. Returned to ER on April 14th, 2021. Same diagnostic testing was performed. I was given more BP medication and recommendations were made for how to lower blood pressure with diet and exercise.

                                                The vaccine has aggravated a tinnitus condition that I have had for around 20 years.  The perceived &#34;volume&#34; of the ringing in my ears became much louder.  This began the day after the vaccine (1st shot), and I have delayed the 2nd shot, and I am considering foregoing the 2nd shot.  The volume has increased considerably, and stays fairly constant from day-to-day.  To date, I have not seen either my Physician or an ENT - both of which I will be doing soon.

Received 2 dose of Epinephrine during ED visit. 5/13/21 After Janssen vaccine he received at this morning around 8:10 AM.  After that he had almost the exact same symptoms with a shooting pain in the left arm and neck some left hand tingling and swelling to the point where he can&#39;t get his wedding ring off and a sensation of pressure/tingling/fullness in the left side.   Given Benadryl and steroids, initially there is no airway concerns or compromise.  However after a period of time, he thought his voice was different.  He did sound just slightly raspy, though I did question whether this could be related to dryness from the Benadryl.  Regardless given that he did note a change, we opted to go ahead and give a dose of epinephrine, which did resolve his symptoms

He got a severe pain in his left hip.  He said the pain was so intense he could barely move so he took a low dose pain killer.  He was in so much pain he curled up in a fetal position and rock back and forth.  He says he was crying and in a hallucination state for about an hour.  After that the he said the symptoms seemed to be getting better but was completely exhausted.  His eyes were red and had trouble with his vision.  On 6/4/2021 he still has some pain and has an ache inside the bone, gets winded w/ moving around but says his symptoms seemed to be improving.

                                                31March2021 rec&#39;d the 2nd Pfizer shot. Next morning 1April, multiple stripes of severe muscle pain from both ears, extending down the rear corners of neck across top of both shoulders to the shoulder joints. The 2nd set of severe pain was thin stripes of pain on the left &amp; right sides of the spinal column from the neck to waist. The pain strips along spine disappeared in 3 days. The neck pain has continued to this day with varying intensity, sometimes random increases in pain.  7th of April 2021: Sudden onset of Covid like symptoms: extreme fatigue, extreme nausea, wild swings in perception of body temp from freezing cold which nothing warms me, to internal heat like a very high temp but not exhibiting any outward signs of fever. Felt like internal organs were heating up and nothing else like forehead or limbs etc.  The symptoms of 7April2021 kept up for at least 2 weeks. No symptoms occurred together, each symptom came for varying lengths of time before subsiding and the next symptom surfaced.  Towards the end of April the intensity of the symptoms was easing and eruptions were getting fewer with more time between.  By end of May only the neck pain remained. BUT.... then the other symptoms reappeared in stronger form and still ongoing.

                                                I experienced a distorted vision problem covering the upper left corner of my visual field.  I assumed it was fatigue.  When it didn?t get better by 4/1/21, I went to Patient First be checked out.  They sent me to Advanced Eye Care to follow-up with an ophthalmologist.  She confirmed that the vision loss was being caused by something in my brain, at which time she sent me to the ER.  At the hospital, an MRI revealed that I had suffered a stroke in the lower right rear side of my brain that was affecting my site in the upper left part of my visual field.

                                                Fatigue and swelling with joint inflammation in left extremities. Follow-up for polyarthralgia   Brief history: Probable reactive arthritis: One week after getting second COVID vaccine (Pfizer, 5/3/2021) he developed chills, sweats, SOB, cough and red/watery eyes. Initially given topical antibiotics for eyes in walk in clinic. Went back and on 5/17/2021 given Medrol dose pack which cleared up symptoms. From 5/10/2021 onward he developed left shoulder soreness and limited ROM. He has had persistent polyarthralgia with morning stiffness. Seen initially in June 2021 with noted joint effusions in left elbow and left knee. Evaluation around that time significant for positive ANA (1:160, speckled), RF (22, normal &lt; 14), SSB, Scl-70 (weakly positive). Other ENA panel and CCP negative. X-ray of left shoulder (6/3/2021) showed only mild degenerative changes suggestive that the limited ROM in shoulder is related to frozen shoulder.   Rheum Medications: Celebrex 200mg daily Doxycycline 100mg daily (started about 2 weeks)   Interval history: Patient was last seen 6/3/2021. He reports that the swelling in the left calf has decreased. The left knee has been bothering him. The mornings are the worse time of day. He continues to have swelling in the left knee. He has been doing ROM exercises with the left shoulder. At night he is not sleeping because of pain. He has morning stiffness which lasts from 20-30 minutes. He has noticed some pain in the left thumb. No eye pain/redness. No rashes.    As in HPI, otherwise 12 point ROS was reviewed and negative

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

He let me know he could not focus enough to read and retain anything.  He wanted to talk but couldn&#39;t find the words.  He remained very quiet but had no other symptoms of fever, pain, or anything else.  10 days post vaccine and he is doing better but still not feeling normal and not talking and holding conversations as usual.  He is able to answer appropriately .  The last two days he said all food is tasting bland without a lot of flavor.  He has taken a couple Tylenol  the last two days and drank Echinacea tea to try and make an improvement.  Is there data or information to give us any idea how long this could last?

                                                About 9.5 hours after receiving injection I noticed a very LOUD high frequency in my head. Using an online frequency generator I have observed the frequency tone around 7,000hz. Always the same tone, same intensity. On a scale of 1-10 the intensity (loudness) around 7. I hear this tone from the time I wake up till I fall asleep, every second, everyday. This has never happened to me before in my life.

                                                Did not connect adverse event to the vaccination until roughly three days after it was recognized. Had first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 on Friday, January 29, 2021. On the following Sunday or Monday (2 or 3 days post vaccination), I noticed ringing in my ears. I have always had perfect hearing, no issues whatsoever. I knew nothing about tinnitus, so just figured it would go away. Days later, it hadn&#39;t gone away so did some research and wondered if it could be associated with the vaccine. Searched the web, but found nothing. Considered calling a hearing specialist (long story so will keep it short), but all info found said there was little that could be done, so did not make the call.  Since couldn&#39;t find relation to vaccine, received second dose on February 19, 2021 without any other issues. Tinnitus continues as originally noticed. Finally yesterday, I related the Covid vaccine to tinnitus after reading an article on J&amp;J&#39;s vaccine candidate that stated tinnitus had been seen as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials.

                                                I had an unusual reaction, my lips swelled up after I received the vaccination. I received the shot about 9:30 am. It started about 5:00 pm to the next morning and subsided. I also had more common symptoms as well headache aches and pains and diarrhea.

Still ringing loudly two days before  appointment to get second dose of Pfizer with some occasional right ear ringing also (which I never had before at any volume). So felt I had to cancel the second dose. Now going on 26 days of constant life changing tinnitus. Obviously hoping it subsides.

Patient reports his symptoms started on Saturday and failed to improve.  He contacted his PCP and he was recommended to go to the ER for evaluation.  Patient had his COVID-19 vaccine-1st dose 2 weeks prior and was concerned that he might be having 1 of the rare side effects from the vaccine. On admission patient had normal vitals.  His labs were within normal limits.  Patient&#39;s presentation was discussed with Neurology who recommended admission for stroke workup given his comorbidities-hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity.  Patient received 1 dose of prednisone 80 mg in the emergency department for treatment of Bell&#39;s palsy (patient&#39;s symptoms more consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy presentation).  Patient was admitted to medicine service for workup of stroke with MRI brain without contrast and monitoring for any worsening of neurological symptoms.  Patient&#39;s CT head on admission was negative for any acute abnormality.  CTA head and neck showed near occlusion of intracranial left vertebral artery.  MRI brain without contrast was negative for acute infarct.  Patient&#39;s facial paralysis slightly improved with 1 dose of 80 mg prednisone.  Patient&#39;s presentation was consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy.  Patient worked with PT OT and speech therapy and was recommended outpatient physical therapy and speech therapy.  He was discharged home in stable condition on oral prednisone 80 mg daily for 7 days and valacyclovir 1000 mg 3 times a day for 7 days.  Patient was recommended to follow-up with Ophthalmology as outpatient for possible left eye patch if his symptoms fail to improve.  Patient&#39;s Lipitor dose was increased to 40 mg daily from 10 mg daily due to finding of atherosclerotic changes on CT head and neck. Active Issues Requiring Follow-up Issue:  Bell&#39;s palsy and abnormal finding on CT head and neck. Recommended follow-up provider/specialty:  PCP What is needed: 1. Referral to Ophthalmology for an eye patch if symptoms fail to improve. 2. Referral to neurovascular surgery for CT head and neck findings.    63-year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus admitted for workup of stroke-like symptoms.         * Stroke-like symptoms Assessment &amp; Plan Patient presented with left-sided facial droop, left forehead droop and slurred speech. - CT head on admission showed no acute intracranial process. - CTA head and Neck shows near occlusion of intracranial left vertebral artery.  Patient reports his symptoms started 3 days ago. Patient&#39;s presentation appears similar to Bell&#39;s palsy.  He received 80 mg of prednisone in the emergency department.  Patient&#39;s symptoms were discussed with stroke Neurology who recommended MRI brain without contrast to rule out possible stroke given his underlying comorbidities-hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity. Plan: - will obtain MRI brain w/o contrast. - Check A1c and Lipid profile - continue Aspirin and statin. - monitor on tele - Neurochecks q4h     Bell&#39;s palsy Assessment &amp; Plan Patient has loss of left forehead wrinkles, left eyelid droop, droop of his left corner of the mouth. Patient&#39;s presentation more consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient reports that he had COVID 19 vaccine 2 weeks prior to developing symptoms and read it as one of the rare side effects online.  Patient received one dose of Prednisone 80 mg in the ED. Will continue with Prednisone taper until MRI results are back.  SLP ordered.  Patient advised on following with ophthalmology for eye patch.

First, I was examined by an opthalmologist. He referred me for CT scans of the head and neck. They were negative.  Second, I was examined by a neuro opthalmologist. He prescribed a blood test which was positive for Myasthenia Gravis. Third, I was examined by a neurologist. We will follow up in two months to note progress of the disease. I am currently scheduled for a chest CT scan to rule out thymoma.

                                                Around 330 on 4/6, I started feeling bad and arrived home around 530pm and  had a slight Temperature (99) with hearing loss in both ears. But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, prediabetic, low thyroid, overweight but not obese, and capillary in the white part of his eye bust (right eye) about 4 months ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). The patient previously took cryproheptadine hydrochloride (CYPRO) and had known allergies. The patient also previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID post-vaccination. The vaccine facility type was Public Health Department. The patient has no other vaccine in four weeks. On 29Mar2021 at 14:00, it&#39;s been about 2 days and for the first day and a half, the patient experienced the normal flu like symptoms. Now after about two days (29Mar2021 at 14:00), he feel just a little out of it, dazed. Also when he leaned back to put eye drops in his eye, he lost his balance a little which does not normally happen. Also within about 12 hours after taking the vaccine, a capillary in the white part of his eye bust and the left side of his left eye was bloody. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events were not recovered.

                                                20 minutes after injection shoulder area started to become number at the injection site. 35 minutes after the injection my neck and face started to become numb.  As the numbness traveled from the injection site (left to right) across my neck and face, the numb areas became a &#34;tingling&#34; feeling on face, lips, chin and below the eye.  Again traveling from left to right (the injection was in the left arm). Day two the above symptoms have lessened but have not gone away.  Starting the same evening of the injection I experienced a progressively worse headache.  As of 4/13/2021 I still have some numbness and tingling on the left side of my lower face between my cheek and chin.  Headache is going away slowly.

                                                Hours after receiving the 1st Pfizer covid vaccine shot I developed tinnitus in my head seemingly not coming from either ear but is a constant high frequency tone in my head. I still have this condition as of 4/15/2021 and plan to see an ENT but am skeptical he/she can do anything about it. It is not an ear infection where my hearing is reduced. Seems as though my hearing is normal or possibly better if anything. I am very healthy, exercising by biking 20 miles a day 3 times per week on average. I have no physical problems at all. Just this constant tone in my head which I am sure is the result of the vaccine shot. Please help!

                                                Within 1 or 2 minutes after getting the vaccine I started to feel like the left side of my face was becoming flushed.  Then I felt my face, and especially my lips, tingle;  then I seemed to be having a neurological reaction--it was like the left side of my face was becoming numb.  For the rest of the day, the left side of my face felt very different from the right-side.  There was some pain around the temple.  The next day, and even through today, 5 days later, the problem has been mainly around my eye.  My eye often feels irritation when I blink and there is some muscular quivering of my lower eyelid. After speaking to my brother who is a radiologist he decided that it was unlikely to be an allergic reaction, and because the feeling of my face on the left side was reminiscent of the feeling I had a year ago when I had shingles around my left eye, he thought the reaction could very well be related to shingles.  In other words, there was a activation of a response that resembled my shingles episode.  This was bolstered by my speaking with my neighbor who also had the pfizer vaccine who said she had a very similar reaction affecting her face that lasted several days, and she,years before, had shingles on her face (as well as the shingles vaccine).

The buzzing is much louder than ever before. It&#39;s now a constant buzz that impacts my sleep, concentration and just trying to relax.

A 63-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient medical history: no. Family medical history: no. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Vaccination facility type: hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility: no. The patient experienced high fever (over 102, 103.7, 102.7, 99 or 100) on 04Apr2021, blurred vision on 04Apr2021, headache on 2021, horrible chills on 2021, night sweats on 2021, shaking like crazy on Apr2021, has no energy on Apr2021, had been feeling tired and rundown on 2021, it was double vision, like looking in a fun house mirror on Apr2021, he was still freezing on Apr2021, did not feel like himself on Apr2021. On Saturday, her brother was out shopping with her and stated that he felt very tired and run down and had a headache. He started running a high fever but stuck it out at home. On 04Apr2021, he was taken to the emergency room and admitted to the hospital. They had been running test after test and can&#39;t seem to find anything wrong. The doctor thought that it was some kind of reaction to the vaccine. The patient was still running a high fever over 102 and was still experiencing fatigue and headaches on and off, and horrible chills and night sweats. The patient wanted to wait until the day after Easter to go to the hospital but started experiencing new symptoms. He was starting to experience blurred vision. Was then taken to the emergency room. The fever went down with Tylenol but continued to go up again when Tylenol wears off. Temperature was 103.7 at one point and has mostly been over 102, stating that this morning was 102.7. It had been one week that he was still having these symptoms. It was strange because the patient was feeling all right for the first 2 weeks. At the hospital, they kept giving him Tylenol to bring the fever down. He had been shaking like crazy. Had horrible chills and night sweats. He had no energy. He had not had the second dose. They cannot find anything else wrong. He was a health nut and run five miles a day. Took good care of himself. He seemed ok the first 2 weeks. Had been a week that he still can&#39;t break the fever. When looked up the symptoms, he had everything except for nausea. He also had blurred vision. They did a spinal tap, echocardiogram, EKG and blood work. He had seen 5 different doctors. The fever was highest at 103.7 and has consistently been over 102. With Tylenol, it had gone down to 99 or 100 but always shoots back up. 2 weeks after the shot, he took his temperature and wasn&#39;t feeling good all day. He stayed home from Wednesday until Sunday when he started experiencing new crazy vision symptoms. Stated that started Saturday. He was taken to the hospital on Easter and was admitted to the hospital, and was still there. The vision problem was new and it started to develop Saturday night. It was double vision, like looking in a fun house mirror. He still experienced the double and blurry vision now but only occasionally, when he tried to get up. It was on and off when he had to get up to go to the bathroom. He was still freezing and had shake and chills. He got night sweats and fever, chills, and did not feel like himself. The reporter didn&#39;t think he had high cholesterol or high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that. Tests: They did bloodwork, CT scans, MRI of the brain, echocardiogram, EKG, spinal tap.  There were no white blood cells found in the spinal tap and that the echocardiogram was good. Everything came back normal. He had seen cardiologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, primary care doctors, and no one can find anything. They did another kind of test regarding his vision. Her brother was depressed and wanted his energy back. It had been a whole week. The outcome of the events high fever (over 102, 103.7, 102.7, 99 or 100) and blurred vision was not recovered, outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient was hospitalized for high fever (over 102, 103.7, 102.7, 99 or 100) and blurred vision from 04Apr2021 to an unknown date. The reporter was not sure if this was happening because of the vaccine.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection and Lot Number: EL9261) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Jan2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 63-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues, poor kidneys and Known allergies: Prescription Drug Soma. Concomitant medication included omalizumab (XOLAIR) injections every 2 weeks for lung issues and poor kidneys. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 at 20:00, the patient started to experience tinnitus in head, very loud! on a scale of 1-10 about 7.

I would have no pain at all, then 5 minutes later the pain would increase to about a level 5. After about a half hour to an hour, the pain would subside.  This would repeat many times a day.   One week from the shot, I visited my dentist, but they didn&#39;t find any problems with the crowns. They gave me Amoxicillin thinking it may be an infection. I don&#39;t think it was because it was both of the teeth, one on top, one on the bottom at the exact same time. In the course of the next week the pain gradually subsided. Today it is almost completely gone and only on the most recent crown.

                                                After getting the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I just experienced arm soreness for the first 24 hours, but then I noticed my tinnitus which I had slightly for many years had become louder and constant. Right now I&#39;d say it is a 3/10. My concern is that if I get the second dose that it will become even louder. My second dose was supposed to be today, but unless the tinnitus diminishes I do not want to risk a second shot for a 10-15% efficacy increase for Covid

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: LL3302) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:00 (63-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes from 2009 or 2010 and ongoing; high blood pressure from 2009 or 2010 and ongoing; ongoing cirrhosis of the liver (As a little boy at 8 years old he got a cut on his right hand. His Mother took him to the Emergency Department and they gave him blood. All that time he didn&#39;t know, until he discovered it at age 32-34. He found out from his primary doctor he had Hepatitis C. His doctor asked if he shot up drugs. He said he did a little pot.  He cut the main artery in his wrist); ongoing heart problems (He always felt problems with his heart. It started in 2014 when he went to the Emergency Room for pain in his chest. They checked his heart and found his blood didn&#39;t flow to the right. It flowed to the left. The Cardiologist told him sometimes his heart beats and sometime it doesn&#39;t. He had 2 veins with blockage, they couldn&#39;t do anything and put him on medication for that); prostate cancer From Dec2019 (He had Cancer twice. He was first diagnosed of Prostate Cancer and received Radiation therapy. He had an exam and the Cancer was back. He had surgery for the Prostate Cancer 18Feb2020); COVID-19 (in the past. His wife had COVID-19 and he had COVID with the same symptoms. He lost his taste for 9 days at the end of Dec2020. He got sick after his wife had COVID-19. His wife got better after having COVID-19. He had no appetite, it was pretty bad). Concomitant medications included a lot of medication (Details were not provided). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: BL3302) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 at 16:30 (62-year-old at time of vaccination), at 0.3ml, single, for COVID-19 immunization and experienced left arm hurt. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Patient weighs between 158-159 pounds. Patient experienced left arm warm and pain after second shot was from 05Feb2021 to 06Feb2021. Patient states he received the second dose on 05Feb2021 and within 30 minutes he started to feel the shot, it was working up in his head, felt like something was working. It was warm and sore. Patient states a couple hours later he was taking Tylenol because his arm was sore. He applied the muscle rub/muscle wrap the next day and it was better. Patient states the day before reporting he began using eyedrops more than usual and using 5 drops because he feels like something is stuck in his eyes. States it&#39;s almost like COVID is in his eyes. In the past month he has been using eye drops more often.  He had been using them before the vaccine. His eyes were itching and he would use the drops to flush them out. Patient would like to know if feeling like something is in the eye is something related to the vaccine or a symptom of COVID-19. He has a lot of sickness. Adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of Left arm warm and pain after second shot was recovered on 06Feb2021; outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                While this first vaccine gave no side effects other than a slightly sore arm, 17 days later on 4-17-2021 I suffered a TIA (Transcient Ischemic Attack). That occurred at 5:15 pm and I immediately took 4-81 mg aspirin and headed for a nearby Emergency Room. They said it was a stroke (and it did show on an MRI the next day but sub-centimeter and I was told the size of a pinhead. AT the ER the double vision in my left eye and numbness in left lips, gum and tongue were already subsiding, but the DR there gave me a Plavix and within 5 minutes I was completely back to normal (or close). I am not sure IF that first dose of vaccine had anytrhing to do with this TIA, but it might have? I had also stopped taking my 81mg aspirin several days before this TIA as I had a Periodontal appointment for insertion of an implant post and wanted to control the possible bleeding. The thoughts of my Doctor at Hospital  as well as the Neurologists was that the omission of the aspirin PROBABLY was the main cause of the temporary clotting that caused this event HOWEVER I did not tell them that I was 17 days post-Covid Pfizer vax #1 and so the possibility remains that the vaccine could have  been partially the cause of this event? As listed previously, Dr at Hospital was my Doctor and might shed some light on this and her thoughts. I felt it was important enough to report as I have heard stories of all of the vaccines possibly causing some clotting and this might fit.

The patient previously took BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) dose 1 in the right arm on 24Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hormones are low. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hormone from an unspecified start date and ongoing; hydrocortisone taken for hormone from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient took the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the next day he was tired on  15Apr2021.  The patient had never been tired in his life like that. The patient was completely passed out.  His wife wanted to call an ambulance and the caller told her no ambulance please. He knew the tiredness would eventually go away. The patient had no energy, zero, for 4 days or so. He has blurred vision for some reason on 15Apr2021. He thinks that the vaccine was no good. The patient has never had blurred vision before that that he is still experiencing some blurred vision.  The blurred vision is what concerns him. His vision is not right and his side effects were severe. The tired disappeared, but the blurred vision is still there at time of call on 23Apr2021. The patient was wearing his reading glasses but that something has happened with his vision.  He had 20/20 vision and now something is not right. The patient was exhausted, passing out, and not polite. The patient has to go to the doctor for the doctor to check his eyes. The outcome of tired was recovering. The outcome of the event blurred vision was not recovered and the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

I have never felt anything  like this, or scare me as much to make me think it might be life threatening as this. I couldnt sleep right after for 1.5 hours and I emailed my primary doctor immediately. In the morning,  I spoke on the phone to 2 Nurses at my docs office before bs. hours who advised me to go to the emergency. rm for a CTA and did. I&#39;ve never really had headaches that have amounted to much.

                                                He got his vaccine, immediately had dizziness.  Within 30 minutes could not move real good due to the Parkinson&#39;s.  He got more confused, more dizzy, and worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s.   He was very thirsty and drank a lot of water (4 liters of bottled water).  He was then urinating and sweating a lot as a way of his body trying to get rid of something in his body.  He was urinating more than he normally does.  He started getting harder for him to breath.  He noticed he had a bad taste in his mouth similar to when he had the COVID virus.  He got a horrible splitting headache/migraine type that kept coming and going.  He still has the taste in his mouth, and it affected the taste of food.  These were all symptoms similar to when he had COVID.  The headache was worse than when he had the virus.  No appetite still, but still continuing to drink the water and not urinating like you did the first day and a half.  He is not having to drink as much as he did before and not feeling like he was dehydrating.  Does have the soreness from the vaccine or any rashes. He did have chills and low grade fever of about 100-101, which have resolved.  He also had a sore throat which he still has.   He had a very bad case of the COVID virus 3/1/21, which lasted for a week or two.  He still has some residual symptoms from the virus with balancing/dizziness or worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s disease.  His neurologist told him that he would recover from the cognitive effects from the COVID with his Parkinson&#39;s, but his motor skills may not return.

                                                Within a few days after completing the second dose, I started experiencing continuous tinnitus in both ears. The levels I am experiencing have not abated since I first noticed it. Before the vaccinations, I would just occasionally experience tinnitus, but those were very brief events that self resolved. The current symptoms are different than what I was experiencing previously.

                                                The first day, I was fine. The next day, I was fatigued. Over the weekend, I was very exhausted. I did not have any sweats or anything. Easter weekend, that&#39;s when it all hit. I woke up at midnight feeling ice cold to the point that I couldn&#39;t get up to get another blanket. I slept pretty much all day the next day. About a week or so later, I started noticed little red bumps on my ankles that itched. It then spread to my knees, elbows, and lower arms. That was towards the middle of April. I kind of ignored it. I began to wonder if I was having a reaction to the shot. I started hearing a ringing in my left ear and I am still experiencing that. My PCP told me to see a dermatologist after looking at the bumps because he didn&#39;t know. I saw the dermatologist on May 19, 2021. He told me to take Zyrtec 3xday. My PCP told me to take prednisone and it didn&#39;t do anything. I also saw an ENT on June 8, 2021. He did a hearing test and said there was some loss of hearing in my left ear. He put me on an extended period of prednisone. It did not make it go away in my case. I went back to see him about 2 weeks later. He recommended for me to have a cortisone injection into the ear drum or behind the ear drum. I decided not to do that. My PCP concurred with my decision. The red bumps are now sporadic. Every 3 or 4 days they show up. I think whatever is causing it is now moving through my system. I have noticed a change in my eye sight on the left side. I have a scheduled eye doctor appointment on July 6, 2021. I have noticed an all of a sudden difference in the last 6 weeks.

                                                64-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of left-sided weakness on his face. He stated when he woke up this morning he noticed that the left side of his mouth drooped and that he could not close his left eye all the way. Yesterday he felt fine. Today he went to work. Patient stated that on 12/18 he got the COVID vaccine. It was on a Friday. The following day he had a headache and he felt flu-like. He stated that those symptoms resolved quickly. He then had the facial weakness today (11 days after the vacciantion). He has not had any fever, sweats, or chills. Patient stated that he had called ask a nurse, and he was advised to hang up and call 911 and go to the emergency room. However, he stated he was an EMT and did not feel that was necessary. He denies headache. He has not had any vision change. He has been eating and drinking well without any difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance - patient was not in any distress. He was conversant, pleasant and appropriate. HEENT - normal conjunctivae and lids. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Patient was not able to close his left eyelid. Normal ear canals. TMs are pearly gray with bright light reflex. Neck - supple. No lymphadenopathy. Skin - pink, warm and dry. Neuro - alert and oriented. Deep tendon reflexes 2&#43; upper and lower extremities with no focal weakness. Normal range of motion. Patient can raise his right eyebrow. Could not raise his left eyebrow. There was impaired eyelid closure on the left; tight closure on the right. Smiling of the face revealed lateralization to the right side. When frowning, he had upper and lower facial paralysis on the left with flattening of the forehead. The patient could not tighten the left side of his mouth.   ASSESSMENT: Bell&#39;s palsy.   PLAN: Discussed pathophysiology of Bell&#39;s palsy. Advised patient I recommended him to call the number that he got with the information when he received his COVID vaccine. Advised patient that I could not definitively correlate the Bell&#39;s palsy with the COVID immunization, but that he can call the number he has to let them know of his symptoms. Discussed treatment options. Since patient woke up with his symptoms this morning, I advised patient that he would have hopefully the best outcome because he would be able to get on the steroid and antiviral soon after developing the symptoms. He is to wear an eye patch to prevent corneal drying or abrasion of the left eye at night. Using Lacri-Lube at night before placing the eye patch and then following up by using artificial tears during the day.   Patient was placed on prednisone 60 mg once a day for 1 week to be taken with food. Valtrex 1,000 mg 3 times a day for 1 week.   Side effects of medication discussed. Handouts were provided. He will follow up with PCP if any changes or concerns. Advised patient that it may take up to 3 weeks before all his symptoms have resolved

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

                                                I received my first Pfizer vaccine on 3/9. This past Thursday, 3/18/21,  I woke up with increased tinnitus (I?ve always had some) and hearing reduction in my right ear. It reminded me of a middle ear infection I had in my youth but this one had resulted in no pain, fever, or dizziness. I do not have a cold or any infectious respiratory issues. I found that it did resolve somewhat if I?d move to a higher elevation and as the day progressed. My left ear would have short spells that would eventually resolve. This continued through Sunday evening when my right ear cleared and I noticed a foul taste in my mouth. Today it?s resumed somewhat, not to the level it was at before, with a little congestion in my left ear...it &#34;crackles&#34; a little when I swallow, but often will clear if I yawn or cough.  I did a little research about the Pfizer vaccine and this situation is listed as a possible side effect that is supposed to be reported, so I am doing so.

This phenomena started again late in the day on the day after the injection although its intensity was less. Now, exactly two days later, I am not hearing this.

                                                Next morning I had a static or whooshing noice in my left ear only. Sometimes it is worse than others.I thought it wasn?t cell phone problem and went to repair outlet. It wasn?t that . The sound / ringing in left ear is bad enough that I can?t have a conversation. My right ear is fine.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the vaccination, I experienced a severe tinnitus, or ringing in the left ear.  I have never experience this level of ringing before, although I have had mild and mostly unnoticeable tinnitus for some time. This was many times more severe. While the intensity has settled down somewhat, I now have a constant, unremitting ringing  in my left ear that is loud enough to be bothersome most of the day. It is still many times louder than anything I have experienced before. I had no other noise exposure or out-of-the-ordinary events that might trigger this.

I fought against the symptoms.

These occurred began on Feb 19th.  See report 330994.  I have had a cortisone shot in both hands.  This has relieved the stiffness somewhat, but not entirely.  No relief for the trigger finger.  The new adverse event is a ear ache and tinnitus.  These started about a week ago.  They are continuous.  I have tried sudafed and zyrtec to no avail.  I will be seeing doctor shortly.

This ended at about 4 a.m. and did not return, but in the morning I had no appetite and had diarrhea. My appetite returned the following day but I also had an issue with my taste being off that lasted for 2 days after the vaccine. Basically with the second shot I got all of the symptoms I had when I got covid in November. After the first shot I only got about half of these symptoms.

                                                1- Mild cough became severe associated with  shortness of breath starting from second day. Since the symptoms were progressively worsening, on doctors advice took one course of Z Pack (Azythromycin) starting from Wednesday04/14. 2- Still having  mild cough. 3- Having dry upper respiratory passages leading to choking sporadically (once or  twice on some days  day). 4- Vision getting poor noticeable  with watery eyes,  started to feel 3 to 4 days after getting first doze COVID19 vaccination.  Consulted an eye specialist on 04/24, who believes the vision issue is due to cataract  getting progressively worse. As far as I know, cataract does not gets worse over period of 3 to 4 days, so there is likely hood of  some adverse effect of the COVID vaccination.

                                                ptosis of right eye; leg pain (both legs); This is a spontaneous report from a consumer. A 64 years old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as SINGLE DOSE (at age of 64 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, restless legs syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, sleep disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Neurological Disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, spinal fusion from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (had 2 spinal fusions. One spinal fusion was of the cervical spine with hardware, and the other spinal fusion was of the lumbar spine with hardware). Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate, atorvastatin calcium (CADUET) strength 5mg/20mg taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; carvedilol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; tadalafil 5 mg taken for enlarged prostate, start and stop date were not reported; alprazolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; ropinirole (ROPINIROLE) taken for restless leg syndrome, start and stop date were not reported; clonazepam taken for sleep disorder, start and stop date were not reported; carbidopa, levodopa 50mg/200mg taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  Historical vaccine information included  BNT162B2, dose 1 on 28Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6205) dose 1, for covid-19 immunization at age of 63 years old. He received second dose on 18Mar2021; 30 days later 18Apr2021 woke up at 5 A.M., noticed ptosis of right eye on 18Apr2021. Concerned she took him to the hospital where he was assessed for stroke, TIA, all tests were negative. Consumer states, &#34;my fiance was hospitalized over the weekend, we do feel it was exactly 30 days after second dose of Pfizer dose, from what I read in medical articles. I see that there were some cases of Palsy experienced by people in clinical trial. He is currently at home. He was in the hospital (emergency room)from 7am on 18Apr2021 and left at 3:50pm that same day against medical advise due to they did not have a neurologist. They wanted to admit him and transfer him to another facility because they didn&#39;t have a neurologist available. She clarified her fiance&#39;s adverse event as ptosis of his right eye.  She said her fiance had diagnostics and blood work performed while at the Emergency Room. She said she wasn&#39;t positive if the blood work performed was a CBC and basic blood chemistry, but the blood work results were normal. She said the hospital she brought her fiance to did not have a neurologist on staff. She said the hospital wanted to admit and transfer her fiance to a specialized hospital with a neurologist on the premises. She said her fiance&#39;s condition did not worsen while at the Emergency Room, but she felt her fiance was not being monitored closely, and was not getting any care. She said since her fiance was not receiving anything at the Emergency Room, and the Emergency Room didn&#39;t have the bandwidth to address his issues, and nothing was done to transport him to another hospital, her fiance left the Emergency Room against medical advice (AMA). She said her fiance went to a neurologist on Monday (19Apr2021). Emergency Room Visit Treatment: Stated her fiance was given Oxycodone while at the Emergency Room. She said she did not know the Oxycodone dose, NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said the Oxycodone was administered for leg pain (both legs) caused by a pre-existing condition her fiance had. She said her fiance normally took Ropinirole for his leg pain. Consumer reported her fiance had follow-up testing done at the neurologist on Monday (19Apr2021), and was waiting for the test results to come back. She clarified the neurologist was doing the follow-up testing to confirm or rule-out a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. Consumer reported when she took her fiance to the Emergency room she thought he was going to be assessed for a possible TIA or stroke, but when it was mentioned her fiance may have Myasthenia Gravis, it was equally concerning. Neurologist Visit Treatment: She stated the neurologist prescribed Pyridostigmine 60mg on Monday (19Apr2021) for her fiance to start taking while the doctor waited for the blood work and repetitive nerve conduction study results to come back. She said the doctor&#39;s logic was to take the Pyridostigmine 60mg, and see if the ptosis resolved, and if the ptosis resolved the doctor would know the cause of the ptosis. She said her fiance&#39;s right eye ptosis had not improved, changed, or resolved since he started taking the Pyridostigmine 60mg. She said she did not have the Pyridostigmine 60mg NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included  blood gases (ABG): unknown on 18Apr2021, Vital capacity: normal  on 18Apr2021, Blood test: unknown on 18Apr2021, COVID-19: negative on 18Apr2021; vital signs measurement: normal on 18Apr2021 . Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of ptosis of right eye. Outcome of the event ptosis of right eye was not recovered. Outcome of the event leg pain (both legs) was unknown.

                                                I have been suffering fron a Pfizer vaccine reaction for about a month and it does not seem to go away.  I went to the doctor a week after the Pfizer 2nd dose and he told me to take Benadryl. I did and it went away for a few days but it came back after a week. I have had hives on my chest and underarms  for about two weks now. Today, I have a hives again and my upper lip is swollen.  Where should  I go for something like this?  I was vaccinated at CVS with my second dose about a month ago. I am 64 and I think I had an anaphilactic reaction to shrimp about 38 years ago.        Thank you,

I did not get this condition/symptom on my first vaccination of 04/14/21. The ringing in my ear (more prominent in my right ear) has continued non-stop since receiving my second vaccination. I am concerned about this adverse effect  and whether this condition will be temporary.

A 64-years-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; ), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 02Apr2021 (at the age of 64 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8733) as 1st SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe sleep apnea from 18Mar2021 (received a machine not long after),  gout (diagnosed about four years ago) , ex-tobacco user from an unknown date to an unknown date (two pack a day smoker over thirty years). Concomitant medication included colchicine (COLCHICINE) 0.6 mg, 1x/day taken for gout, start date was not reported to Apr2021. The patient experienced blood clots in his lungs (hospitalization, medically significant) on 02Apr2021 (also reported as 02May2021). , fainted, fell and hit his head, felt lightheaded/dizziness  on 02Apr2021, The patient was hospitalized from  2Apr2021 to 4Apr202.  It was reported the patient experienced hypoacusis and has a new hearing aid on an unspecified date. Caller says her husband has new hearing aids, which is why he is not doing the report himself.  Patient has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring  on an unspecified date.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: results unavailable on an unspecified date , &#39;they did a couple tests&#39; (details not provided)  results unavailable on 02Apr2021, urine analysis: results unavailable on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of blood clots in his lungs included Thrombectomy on 02Apr2021. The clinical course was reported as follows on April 2nd her husband received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately  an hour later they went to the market and he felt lightheaded, so instead of getting out of the car they sat there 20 minutes. He started to get out again then halfway out the door he fainted and fell down on the ground. She says he was out for, 5-10 minutes, clarified to not even a minute. Since he hit his head she called an ambulance, and they took him to PRIVACY in PRIVACY. They  did a couple tests and said since it was so soon after getting the vaccine that they did not think the vaccine had to do with his blood clots. Caller also stated he fainted because that was one of the side effects of the vaccine, but they were glad he got there since he had several blood clots in his lungs. On the same day (02Apr2021) he had a thrombectomy to remove the blood clots and put him on a blood thinner. Patient was admitted to the hospital April 2nd and was discharged April 4th. He  is doing better, he is on a blood thinner now. She says there were a few doctors that had to weigh in on whether he should get the second dose, they decided it wouldn&#39;t affect it since the vaccine goes into his muscle.  No  other vaccinations on the same days as his Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinations or during the four weeks prior.  Once they placed him on a blood thinner, they took him off Colchicine 0.6mg.  He stopped taking Colchicine because they said the blood thinner doesn&#39;t work with that particular medication.  It was also reported The patient is to schedule an appointment with a  rheumatologist and a hematologist, they did blood work and a urine test and said he has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring. The clinical outcome of the event blood clots in his lungs was Recovered/Resolved with Sequel while the remaining events was unknown. The  second dose bnt162b2 was administered on April 29th. LOT: ER8751, caller hopes that is a 5, the writing is very bad on there. The patient had no side effects from his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                About nine days after the first Pfizer vaccine I noticed a pain in my left tooth where is was difficult to chew. I thought perhaps it was a cracked tooth or abscess but it spread throughout my mouth making it painful to chew any food. It seems that the nerves above the teeth were somehow infected or something. I had pain around my eyes and once in my left ear. I suspected Sinusitis or something but was not sure as I had never had this happen before. I had my dentist look at it. The metal tapping tool showed no cracks. The xrays showed no tooth problems, nor any sign of sinus inflammation.  I reported it to me doctor and he told me to report it on VAERS as a possible side effect of the vaccine. It was severe for about two weeks and has since returned to normal.

                                                Tinnitus; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 64-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 05Mar2021 at 11:20 (Lot number &amp; expiry date were not reported) (at the age of 64-years-old) as 1st dose, single dose; then via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm (shoulder area) on 26Mar2021 at 10:30 (Lot number &amp; expiry date were not reported) (at the age of 64-years-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility type was reported as unknown and vaccine was not administered at military facility. No other vaccines given the same day and no problem with vaccines in past. There were no adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations. Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis (MS). History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and family medical history relevant to AEs were reported as none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Gabapentin and modafinil (PROVIGIL) from unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took interferon (unspecified) at 10mg. The doctor thought that since he has not had any relapse, he was okay not to take Interferon anymore. He wanted Pfizer to know he does have an auto-immune issue. He had used Interferon and then an oral medicine, but unable to provide NDC, Lot, or expiry for either product since it has been 3 years since he&#39;d been on that. He did mention taking Gabapentin before bed and Provigil in the morning. The patient experienced tinnitus and fatigue on Mar2021 and ongoing. The patient reported side effects after the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. He had the first dose on 05Mar2021 and second dose on 26Mar2021. After the first shot his tinnitus started and he was also fatigued. Patient clarified he didn&#39;t go to the doctor for the fatigue, but the tinnitus. He only mentioned the tinnitus. He also went to the doctor today and noticed since the vaccine and how ironic besides having the tinnitus how much more fatigue he has. He never took naps in the afternoon and now he does, he needs to. He is much more fatigued, and he even does yoga and notices his balance also. Before today&#39;s visit he had seen specialist, ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctor and told him the same thing and had asked if what he experienced was possible. He saw the ENT doctor on 31Mar2021 and was told he did not know if that was very common, but prescribed him steroids, which he took.  He stated that with the steroids the tinnitus didn&#39;t get any better and he is not better now. He got ahold of his family provider recently to see if there was anything else that could be done like cleaning ears for wax or seeing if there was an infection, or something since he had no relief from the ENT visit. Later he clarified that steroids given by ENT was Prednisone 10mg tablets. He had 69 tablets and it was pretty strong and has used them all. He noticed the tinnitus maybe the week after getting the first dose. He didn&#39;t really think much about it, but it kept ongoing. This has been ongoing since after first and second shot. The event tinnitus did not require a visit to the Emergency Room but required a visit to Physician Office. Relevant tests done was unknown. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Shortness of Breath for few days after vaccine #1; after vaccine #2 shortness of breath increased along 10 day period, so I contacted PCP. Clinical exam, chest xray, blood work resulted D-Dimer level increase, so CT scan ordered. Result was lungs full of PE. Placed on Eliquis and referred to hematologist. Hematologist ordered deeper dive in blood work as well as echocardiogram, which displayed a widening in aortic root and ascending aorta, but no ventricular or valve damage. Dr. will continue to monitor and refer me to cardiologist. Other symptoms include unprovoked fatigue, some shortness of breath, a strange smell of burning plastic and cramping of the upper part of my feet, only at night. Never tested posit  positive for COVID with wife and son both had &#34;undocumented&#34; COVID in January and March 2020. They both have antibodies (confirmed with blood testing) and I did not have antibodies. Our physician would not authorize a test for COVID at the time of their symptoms as tests were so coveted and not authorized widely at the times of their illnesses. I really want someone to come forward and confirm the causation and correlation of my symptoms to the vaccine, because I am otherwise an extremely health and active 64 year old with no preexisting or predisposed conditions to widespread PE...not just a clot or two...it is wide spread throughout all lobes of my lungs!

Sitting down I lost vision in my right eye (just dark grey with a tiny blurry spot of light in the center).  Left eye could not focus.  After about twenty minutes,  both eyes became very sensitive to light (like a pupil dilation test in an eye exam).  This lasted about  additional 10 minutes.  I remained pretty weak for the next hour but was then ok.  The next day I felt 100%.

A 64-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiry 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 (age at the time of vaccination was 64-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included COPD treated by CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), high blood pressure, cancerous tumors removed from bladder, atrial fibrillation. The patient&#39;s history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. The patient had no additional administered vaccines on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not required any visit to emergency room or physician office. The patient had no loss of taste and smell within 4 weeks of prior vaccinations. The patient had no adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient had no predisposing factors. No culture test was performed. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Eliquis (apixaban) taken for cardiac disorder from Feb2021 to an unspecified stop date; lisinopril and metoprolol tartrate for an unspecified indication. The patient called about the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient had his first COVID-19 vaccine on 17Mar2021. The patient had no issues with the first vaccine. About 2 weeks after the first dose received maybe around 01Apr2021, the patient started sneezing, having some phlegm, and coughing stuff up. The patient used a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine at night. Around 09Apr2021, the patient lost his taste and smell. The patient was scheduled for his second COVID-19 vaccine on 10Apr2021 but thought his symptoms were worse than the patient originally thought. The patient went to his doctor on 09Apr2021. The patient&#39;s doctor did the nasal swab for the COVID-19 virus. The patient never had a fever or chills. The patient&#39;s doctor gave him some erythromycin. The patient also did some blood tests. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 virus test came back negative. On the results of his blood tests on the first page, the first thing it says are that the patient&#39;s COVID-19 results were negative. The patient&#39;s doctor told him that the patient&#39;s body showed no response to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient did not see that this blood test was testing for antibodies. Later in blood test paperwork the patient saw that it said antibodies not detected, does not preclude acute Sars-Cov-2 infection. The patient&#39;s paperwork said IgG and IgM were negative. The patient provided the following in a historical context. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, prior to receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine the patient had some heart problems. The patient gone into atrial fibrillation. The doctor prescribed Eliquis and put him on a heart monitor. The patient took a nuclear stress test and that was ok and now the patient was wearing a heart monitor. The patient&#39;s reading from his blood test results. The patient&#39;s D-dimer result was 0.44. In the reference range it said anything less than 0.50 was a normal range. But the patient was taking Eliquis and his doctor told him his D-dimer should be zero. The patient&#39;s doctor told him his D dimer was elevated. The patient&#39;s doctor believed the first COVID-19 vaccine has something to do with his D-dimer result. The caller reports that the patient heard about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and blood clots but he had not heard anything about Pfizer having problems with blood clots or anything of that nature. The patient now has his second COVID-19 vaccine scheduled for next day on 23Apr2021. The patient&#39;s follow up visit with his doctor was on 17Apr2021. The patient&#39;s doctor advised him to wait until mid May2021 and start all over with the COVID-19 vaccines but this time his doctor wants him to get the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was not sure why his doctor was wanting him to stay away from Pfizer. Was there an indication that the patient was not aware of that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine would cause his D dimer to be elevated at 0.44. The patient was aware and there may be other factors that cause his D dimer to be elevated. The patient just wants to see if he can get his second COVID-19 vaccine. The patient just wants to get the vaccine and get on with his life. The patient would not get the vaccine if there was a known reason not to get it. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I had previously had covid as of early Dec 2020.  I was negative some time mid to late January.  I had a vitrectomy in my right eye in 2020 to remove a macular pucker and eliminate floaters.  Dr. performed the surgery.  The night of April 7 I had searing pain in my right eye and a sort of migraine on my right side.  Pain dissipated some the next day but came back intermittently.  I went to on call that saturday, received an avastin injection and was told to come back Monday.  I was diagnosed with acute glaucoma, had surgery on the 12th of may and was blind in my right eye for about a month while the blood in my eye was reduced by meds and drops.  It is still not back to normal, but I can see from the eye.

Very clearly concentration of attention driven. This condition came on slowly. It took weeks after injections for the symptoms to develop. They remain. And seem to be getting more severe.  My opthamologist has refered me to a neuroopthamologist.  I can not think of any other causative factor in the last years, month, and weeks that could account for what I am experiencing. I have had NO illnesses. I have not had Covid-19 to the best of my knowledge.  (Note: date &amp; time given for #5 above is approximate)

                                                Pronounced change in taste/smell.  These senses were not lost, but changed in pronounced ways.  Foods commonly left bad (metallic) aftertaste in mouth, and highly spiced foods sometimes caused either immediate sneezing (as in allergies) or gut discomfort.  During this period I noticed episodes of sinus and/or ear infections.    The symptoms started around the time of first injection, although I did not recognize them as a pattern for some time.   The strength of the symptoms fluctuate in time.   3.5 months after the 1st injection  it seems that taste/smell is becoming more normal, although there may be some residual, fluctuating symptoms.

Second dose on February 4, 2021 - Experienced Anaphylactic Shock. 10 minutes after second shot I experienced lip and tongue swelling, facial tingling, and throat tightening.   I was in the waiting room for observation.  Symptoms started while in the waiting room. The nurse who monitored the patients saw my reaction.  She had to hold me under my arm to help me walk back to the nurses who gave the vaccines.  When I arrived, my vision got black and I passed out.  I passed out from the reaction to the vaccine.  I have a history of Anaphylaxis,  I carried episode pens for years.  I forgot my episode pens that evening but I carried my own benadryl.  I stopped the reaction by drinking liquid Benadryl.  I was later transported to the ER via ambulance for monitoring and also for being groggy to the Benadryl.  My symptoms from the reactions were: lip swelling, tongue swelling, facial tingling, throat tightening, and sudden loss of consciousness for a few seconds.

Felt like little bubbles like they are going to pop; hands are numb, tingling, feel swollen, can&#39;t bend them or hold things for maybe a couple of minutes and can&#39;t grip anything was worsened; hardly walk/ lower back got so painful; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 64-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINATION; lot number: ENG206), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 17Mar2021 at 13:00 as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart attack from 1994, left side kidney removed in 2015 and single functional kidney on right side from 2015. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINATION; lot number: ENG202), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 24Feb2021 at 13:00 as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization and experienced headache, stiff neck, peripheral vision was bad, migraine and swelling of hand and feet. The patient previously took (UBRELVY) for migraine and visual distortion. The patient had a headache and stiff neck really for no apparent reason and they continued. Then he noticed that his peripheral vision and vision was bad with visual distortion in Mar2021. He called his primary care provider and told him about this, and he was prescribed a steroid pack and for 2 months he was provided a muscle relaxer to help. They provided some relief but didn&#39;t get rid of it. Believes the steroid was a Zpack for inflammation and was unable to provide the name of the muscle relaxer or the NDC, Lot, or expiry for either Zpack or muscle relaxer given. Eventually, they continued and after he had the visual distortion, he went to an eye doctor to make sure nothing was wrong like a tumor that was causing the headaches or stiff neck. Eye doctor told him nothing wrong with his eyes and they were fine, not tumor, he just had migraines and he never had migraines before. He saw a neurologist and was diagnosed with migraines. On the first neurology appointment, they gave him an injection in the stomach, but he does not know the name of it. The second visit was given shots in the back of head and back of neck. On that next visit, he got a shot in the stomach and most of it was quiet down with the migraines and the visual distortion and he still had them. The patient was then given a drug to take to help when they flared up, for break through migraines in 2021. It was 100mg. He was given the free ones and he could only take up to 10 in a month. He was given 4 of them and only had to use 2 of them and the migraines and visual distortion has gone away. Provides NDC, lot number 1843724 and expiry of Jul2022. He started this in Apr2021 or in May2021 after his first visit with neurologist, (withheld). During the same time, he had the migraines and also started having pains in his upper thighs, felt like in his muscles. States imagine little bubbles like they are going to pop was how it felt in 2021. They went away and stopped. He then started to have back stuff, pains that started in Mar2021 or Apr2021. They stopped after 7-8 days later and then they were gone. He was then sent to a nerve specialist and they did a conduction nerve test to see if what happened affected his nerves and the test was fine. Then all of a sudden, after one thing happened and went away another one would start and then his lower back got so painful so that he could hardly walk and went to an orthopedist thinking it could be a pinched nerve in 2021. They did x-rays but could not see anything that caused this kind of pain. They didn&#39;t give him anything, but 7 days after that he was fine ever since, and it just went away. He also had pains in the upper arms that felt like someone was giving him shots at the same time in both arms and also a kind that hurts and stays hurting. Felt like they didn&#39;t pull out the needle, like someone was pressing the needle in the arm, directly in the area you are getting a shot, but this feeling lasted much longer. Had this very same feeling in the top of both shoulders and they were intermittent. One minute he would have them and the next they could last about 5 minutes, or it could be gone for 5 hours and show up again in 5 minutes. It was not consistent and happen every hour. This also resolved in May2021 along with the migraines. Patient had pains at top of shoulders fell in line with his neck, where the soft spot between the collar bone is which was like getting a shot in his arm. Again, he no longer has these symptoms and no problems with vaccines in the past. Provides he had second dose on 17Mar2021 in left arm and lot number of ENG206. No further details provided. Started in the beginning of Jun probably, it&#39;s been about two and half weeks. He had not been able to use his hands. They are numb, tingling, feel swollen, he can&#39;t bend them or hold things for maybe a couple of minutes. He can&#39;t grip anything in Jun2021 and also got worsened in 2021. Extending from the tip of his fingers all the way up to the shoulders, in his left arm especially causes the wrist to hurt in Jun2021. It hurts all up to the left shoulder. In the right arm it only goes up to the bicep and these have gotten worse and are continuing to get worse. The patient was given tramadol for that pain and unable to provide NDC, Lot, or expiry from orange pharmacy for tramadol bottle. He takes 50mg, 1-2 tablets by mouth four times daily. It was prescribed 16Jun2021 and expires 16Jun2022. These pain pills help some, it takes the pain away, but does not allow him to grip with his hands or anything else. Now it may sound crazy, but when he coughed it would make him feel like the inside of his biceps were going to explode. It went away and only lasted a week. After a week this went away, but to touch it hurts after he coughed. Still had tenderness in both sides in the muscles, but at that time it felt like they were exploding outwards. Again, mentions he no longer has this. His feet are swollen up and he has never had that before now. Went back to see his heart doctor. He had gone to have a Covid test and heart test in Jan2021. With the swelling in the feet, he felt it had something to do with the heart and he went to see the cardiologist where they asked about testing which was done by primary care provider and also had antinuclear antibody testing done with primary care and that test came back with no arthritis in the hands on an unknown date. The patient mentioned he had a heart attack at age 38 before he had COVID vaccine, since he is 64 now. He didn&#39;t have any chest pains and didn&#39;t fall under those heart symptom questions asked. None had anything to do with his heart and the provider felt symptoms probably due to with the vaccine, but there is not enough information out there on it yet. He saw about 6 specialist and they all say the same thing. The patient still had his feet and hands swelling. He had a heart attack in the past or how it will affect his muscles in his heart because he does not want to find out later that it had affected his heart, and nobody knew. The patient also had an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, blood vessels and nerves ordered by his Neurologist as well. The outcome of peripheral vision bad, his vision was bad; visual distortion was recovered in Mar2021; pains in upper thighs was recovered in May2021; lower back got so painful so that he could hardly walk was recovering; felt like bubbles in muscles like they pop was unknown while the other events was not recovered.

Being in this location for 6 months I really have no primary doctor and I went to the hospital. They?re tests listed below and all came back normal. Was given paperwork for Fainting (Syncope) and released. The Doctor stated that with all the causes of Fainting it seemed the only one that pertained to me was ?old age?.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.

                                                101 fever for 5 days straight. Still get a fever every afternoon/evening but about 99. Extreme fatigue for first 10 days. As soon as eat breakfast have to go back to bed for 1-3 hours. Same with lunch, eat, go back to bed about 3 hours and same with dinner. Then go to bed for evening. Extreme brain fog and forgetfulness. Can&#39;t think of words or make sentences. Can&#39;t remember anything. Feels like a very heavy feeling in head like head weighs a lot and very cloudy. Pain from shot in arm moved up to neck, ear and jaw the day after shot. Arm quit hurting but couldn&#39;t lift it. Pain stayed in neck, ear and jaw for a week and now is a stiff feeling. I think the lymph nodes are swollen. Effects eating, hard to keep food down. Nausea and stomach pain. I have appetite but have to eat while nauseous and pain. Still severely fatigued every day and have to sleep most of each day or at least sit and rest. So exhausted. Also night of shot started getting hot and cold chills. Still have them over 2 weeks after shot. Bad tinnitus started night of shot and still have it over 2 weeks after shot. Very loud and nothing makes it go away. Bad headache started morning after shot. I have had a headache pretty much everyday, all day since the shot over 2 weeks ago. I feel sick like I have flu.

Ear and Face were swollen, warm to touch, painful and could not hear.  I am still having difficulty hearing in that ear (3-25-2021), sounds like liquid in that ear.  I called a tele doc service on Sunday, 02/14/2021, they prescribed Amoxicillin -Clav.  Temperature and swelling went away, still having difficulty hearing in that ear.

                                                Previous to  Pfizer vaccines I had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms. I&#39;m a retired dentist. I wasn&#39;t aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus. It is now on the verge of being debilitating in nature. It is now  pulsating and much louder, very difficult to ignore even during day time activities. Before my tinnitus was bilaterally equal, now I would say my right ear is louder than my left. But both are louder than before. Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.

It really got annoyingly noticeable in both ears after shot two.  I would consider the after  effects of each dose to be normal...dose 1 felt a little lousy the next day with headache and fatigue but ok after that, dose 2 felt lousy the next day with low grade fever about 100.5.  Felt fine the next day.  Except for the tinnitus.

A 65-year-old male patient received a first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 (Lot Number: EK9231) as single dose for prevention. Medical history included pulmonary fibrosis and dyslexia. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported &#34;excruciating joint pain after receiving 1st dose Pfizer vaccine. Second dose was scheduled for 04Feb2021. Patient stated that three days after receiving the first dose he had arthritic pain, on thumb - like he broke his thumb (he put on aspercreme and took Advil) but night it went away. The next day my left foot (he put on aspercreme and took Advil), then moved up to his right wrist. same thing. excruciating joint pain and it would move around, it started on his thumb one his right side, then went to toes on left side, it was his whole body, both elbows, now he can&#39;t lift his left arm (injection arm) for 4 days. There is pain in his shoulder, he can move his shoulder, but to do the chicken wing with his arm, he cannot do it. Got the shot on 14Jan2021, this started 3 days later. To switch positions, from his toes to his knee joints, and it is both sides of his body. His little joints are there one day and gone, he puts Aspercreme on and took Advil, and by night time the pain was gone, but the next day it was somewhere else. The smaller joints, like in his toes and knuckles on his hands, lasted one day, but his knees, bigger joints, was 2 days, his wrists were a day, it even went up to his jawbone, he couldn&#39;t suck soup, so it&#39;s pretty bad when you can&#39;t drink soup. His left arm had been going on for 4 days. He went to his rheumatologist, and the doctor he took 9 vials of blood, because caller&#39;s next shot is supposed to be on 04Feb2021, and he was up in the air about getting it with all the pain going on, so the doctor took a look, did 9 vials of blood, and said right now he would not advise getting it until he looked at the bloodwork to see if there was compatible, and the doctor said he would be in touch by the 4thFeb2021. Patient stated he was dyslexic. He also stated he had a hard time getting around with oxygen. Patient stated that he sees a lung specialist for the last 5 years, he has pulmonary fibrosis. Seriousness of the event was reported as non-serious. The patient underwent lab test that includes bloodwork: unknown results on an unspecified date. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot Number: EL3247, expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at the age of 65 years old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing arthritis, started experiencing this problem with my taste in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen for arthritis, cetirizine (tablet) at 1 DF, once a day, vitamin D1, vitamins and multivitamins. Patient stated on 05Feb2021, got first Pfizer shot. Patient noticed that they told him to come back in about three weeks. From 05Feb2021, they told him to come back on 26Feb2021. He said okay. First of 15 minutes they told him to stay there to see if he had any reactions. He was okay. He noticed in probably the last week and half though that he had a sense like no taste, no taste buds, and no sense of taste in his mouth. It is like 75% has gone on an unspecified date in 2021. Other symptoms are, patient got some chronic back problem, they seem to worsening, in his spine, in his joint, his back in lower back area and in his shoulder part area also on an unspecified date in 2021. Should he get his second shot coming up 26Feb2021, go ahead and get it?&#34; was his question. Patient stated, &#34;I am disabled vet (not clarified). I am like kind of regarded like 100% disabled vet. I am on &#39;test&#39; in hospital where I got my shot. &#34;Patient stated, &#34;I just wanted to know if other people called in, told you about they start losing taste buds too, the sense of smell and taste.&#34; Patient stated, &#34;I started experiencing this problem with my taste. It seems like around, probably Aug2020, I had like a some taste that I was losing but it seems like after I got this shot about when 4 months later, after I got the shot (Covid-19 Vaccine) I noticed it got worsened. But I am not running, no fever. I haven&#39;t had fever, cold or cough or chills or anything.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

Stayed inside. stopped smoking (marijuana), nasal mist. Very dry sinuses and eyes especially the left eye. The pain proceeded to worsen and I rinsed my sinuses with nasal mist which eventually relieved the pain. At one point during the rinsing I had a short flow of blood from my sinuses. I used eye drops for the dryness in my eyes. I had occasional pain in my legs during the week of the 5th followed by extreme back and leg pain on the 11th. This pain and spasms mainly effected regions where I have had long term weakness. I still have minor pain as is typical.

                                                increase in my tinnitus/ right ear is louder than my left; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable other healthcare professional (retired dentist/ also the patient). A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 16:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9264) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included Chronic tinnitus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Patient had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms, Before the vaccines). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, also not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and no any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 first dose on 18Jan2021 (lot number: EK4176) on 18Jan2021 in left arm for covid-19 immunization. It was reported by the patient that: &#34;previous to the vaccines I had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms. I am a retired dentist. I was not aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus (on 21Feb2021). It is now on the verge of being debilitating in nature. It is now  pulsating and much louder, very difficult to ignore even during day time activities. Before my tinnitus was bilaterally equal, now I would say my right ear is louder than my left. But both are louder than before. Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.&#34; The outcome of the event was not recovered. The case was considered as serious (criteria-Disabling/Incapacitating: Yes). No treatment was received for the adverse event.   Additional information has been requested.

It seemed to get better and then on 04/7/2021 I noticed the sight in my right eye was again blurry.  My second dose was on 03/22/2021.  The sight in my right eye has been getting progressively worse each day.  I am now experiencing double vision.  I went to an ophthalmologist and got numerous tests performed.  After they could find the cause I was sent for an MRI which did not find the cause.

                                                Salivary gland reactions; Was told by this doctor that he has seen 6 other patients with similar dry mouth who have had the COVID-19 vaccination; Sleeplessness; I can barely breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reporting herself.  A 55-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported) on left arm on 04Feb2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient also received zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) and mirtazapine (manufacturer unknown) for unknown indication. Medical history was not reported and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: it looks like ELR84), via an unspecified route of administration in the Left arm on 14Jan2021 at unknown time as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 25Feb2021, almost exactly 3 weeks after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the patient started experiencing horrible dry mouth conditions for 6-7 weeks. He stated that due to this persistent dry mouth, he had only been able to sleep on average 3 to 4 hours a night for the past 6 to 7 weeks. Patient reported that he hasn&#39;t come back from an ENT specialist regarding this and was told by this doctor that he had seen 6 other patients with similar dry mouth who have had the COVID-19 vaccination and/or COVID-19 itself. It was stated that his doctor also referenced an article in a journal that came out a few days ago that stated COVID-19 was shown to infect the salivary glands. He stated that his doctor was unable to give any further recommendations other than gave him things to keep him comfortable such as Salagen. He also mentioned that after receiving the vaccine, he was being awoken every 20 minutes all night long and many times had to urinate but reported that this side effects has subsided. He stated he read on the internet about a woman who also had COVID-19 who reported having bad dry mouth and was urinating more often than he had in her whole life. He called at the recommendation of her doctor nasal and throat surgeon who said he was going to speaking with his peers about this, but he suggested that he call him too. So, it would appear that he had and several of his patients had similar symptoms to him. He had been suffering from the extreme and when he said extreme, he said the most extreme case he had seen in his 45 years of medicine. Extreme case of might be dry mouth or sleeplessness to this point when he can barely breath. He had maybe 3-4 hours of sleep over the last 6 weeks. They kept thinking that she was allergic that the medication that she was on, but she did not off that medications for a week. They thought of food, he was ingesting they removed every food stuff he finally saw an ENT and he said well, he was the 5th patient he had seen like this, this month and she was telling them he cannot swear by it but it was COVID. He said the only thing that made any sense had seen medication before and they just don&#39;t know yet. This was not just enough information and he showed him an article for that he just found the other day that said this enough, COVID was infecting salivary glands or was believed to be so it would seem this might be something that was being recorded yet and might be somebody wanted to take a look at mine. He doesn&#39;t know but it was he can&#39;t find anything anywhere about this. He can&#39;t either except the story that he saw just a few days ago which was professional (Name) journal about COVID now infecting salivary glands that was exactly they know he was suffering it somewhat of freak salivary gland reactions that could be it or could had been COVID (Further not clarified hence PC filed conservatively). When probed for the Date of Vaccine administration for both COVID Vaccine shots, Patient stated that second dose was Feb 4th, and the second dose would be 4 weeks before that. When probed for the exact date of Vaccine administration for both COVID Vaccine shots, patient stated, if they hold on, she get her vaccination card. It would be there right. It was in January, he doesn&#39;t knew it looks like 14Jan2021. When probed whether the Vaccine was purchased or she got injected at the clinic, he stated that he got injected. The first on, it looked like ELR84 that was the first dose. When confirmed LOT# as ELR84: he stated, it looked like A but their writing was terrible. He though, it was A it said, or could be G. For second one, EN9581. (Hence second dose LOT captured in tab). Dose for both shots of vaccine: patient stated, that doesn&#39;t say. No one say about that. When probed for the site of administration for both shots of vaccine, she stated left arm. When confirmed the vaccine was administered on left arm both the times, stated, she did not remember. (Later confirmed as yes). When probed for Other medications, he stated that not now, no, he had been. (Further clarification unknown) Names of medications: he stated, that was taking Myrbetriq none of these were taken very long they expected these were causing the dry mouth. So, he stopped taking them. it was reported that It was Oxybutynin, let him get it. thought the dry mouth was being caused by the medications. So, they tried switching medications. He had several drugs in that stage for few weeks. So, Oxybutynin was the first one. He took Myrbetriq on February 25th 50 mg, Oxybutynin 50 mg tablet, 1 tablet her mouth daily and then they had Peficare that was for sulfonation and 5 mg,(Further clarification unknown) Tolterodine that was standard Detrol that was 4 mg, Darifenacin,(Was not clarified further hence not captured as concomitant medication) than there were sleep medications none of which worked, none of which solved dry mouth problem, they were Ambien that was Zolpidem 5 mg, Mirtazapine (hence captured as suspect) 50 mg and there was one more, looking that. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent laboratory tests, he was tested for Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome for the markers of Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome, and they were negative. It was approximately a 1 week ago, 7 days ago and here her result came like he cannot give them the exact date. The outcome was persisting. He was prescribed (further not clarified) Salagen (treatment) in order to generate more saliva. He stated that than there were sleep medication none of it worked, solved dry mouth problem, they were Ambien, Zolpidem 5 mg, Mirtazapine(treatment) 50 mg and there was one more, looking that. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Dr gave me Z-Pack and prednisone steroid.  Still no relief 7 days later. Symptom #2:  also around 16 days after my second dose my tinnitus started getting louder with more shrill variations to the typical cricket chirp type of sounds I have heard for about the last 5 years.  Never any relief from these sounds!

                                                Only slight injection site pain for first shot. With the 2nd shot, I had pain at injection site that radiated into my shoulder  8-15 hours after initial injection. Noticed swollen lymph glands in armpit of vaccinated arm after 24 hrs.  All these particular symptoms disappeared after 36-48 hrs.  Along with these symptoms I began to have very loud tinnitus which I have suffered from for years but nothing to this volume.  Approximately 11 days after the 2nd dose I came home from working a short day and after a meal began to feel like my blood pressure was up because my head felt pressured and I could tell my heart was racing.  Checked my blood pressure and it was at rest 140/105 w/ 96 bpm.  I am not on any bp meds because I have never been prone to high blood pressure. Bp prior to this occurrence has always been in the 117-120/76-80 range with a bpm of around 64-70.  Chest pain radiate from front to back to front and stayed that way until I went to emergency room 3 days later believing I may have had a heart attack.  I was administered an EKG, had blood serum tests and a CT scan - all of which were normal and or showing no signs of a heart attack.  I was kept overnight for observation with blood being drawn middle of the night and vitals being monitored.  The morning of the next day I was administered a stress test which I apparently passed no problem.

                                                2 weeks after the 2nd shot I woke up with a pain going from my left armpit, along my collarbone to my neck under my jawline. It felt like a string from my armpit to my neck was too  short and tight. I also felt slightly ill with pain behind my eyes for the 1st 2 weeks when pain began. I assumed it was my lymph nodes on my l eft side that was affected and not a muscle issue since rubbing it made it hurt more. By the 3rd week I was able to go back to swimming and other activities. It&#39;s 8 weeks now but still slightly tender on collarbone and neck.

I went into my doctor and they performed an audiologist test was run by a hearing Specialist on  05/14/2021  and then sent to an ENT, who diagnosed Tinnitus on 05/17/2021. She also said that I had a hearing infection inside my ear and that it was contributed to the vaccine and that there was nothing they could do because it was one of the side affects from the vaccine. She advised me to come back to see if it my hearing became worst (any changes in my condition). I still suffer from an intermittent ringing in my left ear but occasionally once every two weeks my left ear shuts down and I cannot hear anything for two minutes and then my hearing reappears. I have no issues with my right ear at all.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I had low grade fever, felt tired and unwell.  On day 3, a rash (hot, red, and raised) appeared on the trunk, hips, stomach.  On the right side of the body, there was a 3 inch strip of  hives/rash  from arm pit and collar bone area  to waist, hip  and pelvic area.  I did take Benadryl.  On 3/21/2021 at 10am, the rash increased from neck to groin, legs and arms and sprinkled on the back and across the shoulder to buttocks. I continued to take Benadryl.  The hives had also spread to my face.  My eyelids and cheeks were swollen. I had a fever of 101.3.   I did take Tylenol for the fever.  On 3/22/2021 the hives on the chest greatly improved but the hives on the back and face had worsen. I could barely open my left eye and my face was swollen.  Around midnight 3/23/2021 I decided to go to the ER  since my face, mouth and hands begin to swell.   At the ER,  the doctors said I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and was given Prednisone and Tylenol and was discharged with a prescription for prednisone to continue.  I took the prednisone and everything seem to improve. It took about 3 day for the body rash to go away.   On 3/26/2021 a chicken pox like patch appeared on my face to the right of my chin.  The rash looked like raised pustules.  I went to the doctor on 3/27/2021 and was diagnosed with herpes and I was prescribed Valtrex.  It took about a week for the herpes to go away.   I have photographs of the rash if needed for more documentation.

It has subsided, however, numbness and tingling sensation still present in the external ear. After that, I started feeling symptoms similar to those in the disease ALS; ie, extreme fatigue, weight loss due to loss of muscle mass, especially in the legs and buttocks, muscle weakness, edema in the lower extremities and face, blurred vision, imbalance, clumsiness, and lightheadedness/dizziness.

                                                Type 2 Diabetes ? November 2020 my bloodwork was normal, A1C was 5.7, HDL and LDL good, yet my triglycerides were high, 280, which has been the case for the last 20 years.  I was in good health, no problems, only meds were fish oil and Simvastatin for the last 5 or 10 years for the high triglycerides.   My second COVID shot was on 10 March 2021.  In a week I became thirsty and noticed weight loss which I thought was good since I was 215 at the time and trying to lose weight.  Over the next few weeks the weight continued to come off an my thirst became unquenchable.  Mid April I saw Dr. who ordered blood work.  I saw her for a follow-up on the 23rd and she put me on 2000 mg metformin and 20 mg insulin a day, my triglycerides were 4,132, blood suger (BS) over 400.  Ordered me off sugar and carbohydrates, ordered a FreeStyle Libre 2 which that day pegged (350 mg).   A week later not much was changing and Dr had me go to 30 insulin daily which helped the numbers start coming down yet gradually.  Over the next 4 weeks the BS started bouncing between 250 and 350, then 150 and 250, and later 120 and 200 with one under 80 (i.e., low) event.  During that time I reduced my insulin to 25 mgl a day, then after two more under 80 BS events I was ordered off insulin, and half metformin dose (1000 daily).  This week I saw my Endocology specialist who said I was extremely lucky because folks with triglycerides over 2,000 don?t live long (months not years).   He kept me on metformin and ordered new blood test adding urine saying the prior panel (when numbers were extremely high) were not valid for my current state being more normal BS numbers.  I will see him again 7/29/21.   I would appreciate any advice or observations you could provide of others all of a sudden become type 2 diabetes after receiving the covid vaccine, what their diagnosis was, treatment, results, etc.  Also, does Pfizer have any advice or corrective action they could offer, or at least data from other folks having a similar problem as me?

                                                After receiving the vaccine, it seemed as if I had a curtain come down over my right eye in a diagonal way. I had blindness that covered a third of my vison in the upper right corner. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first, but then it happened a third time so I thought that was odd. I called my eye doctor the last time it happened. I thought it was a detached retina. I went to the doctor the next day but he couldn&#39;t find any signs of a detached retina. He was concerned I had a TIA. He wants me to have a doppler of carotid arteries in my neck. I had an appointment with an ophthalmologist on May 25th. My appointment for the doppler was on June 1st. On June 3rd, I went to my family doctorand he looked at results of the test. He was concerned about temporary blindness but doesn&#39;t know the cause of it. He wants me to see a neurologist. On June 30th I had an appointment with the neurologist and he said he didn&#39;t think it was a TIA. Nothing has been found or discovered as to why I am experiencing the temporary blindness. As of May 24th, that was the last incident I had with temporary blindness, and I haven&#39;t had it since.

I also experienced a slight metallic taste in my mouth. I also sensed a somewhat increased heart rate and some slight dizziness. I did NOT experience any breathing difficulties but maybe had a very slight wheeze sensation. These reactions lasted only about 8 to 10 minutes then started easing away. I was monitored a full 30 minutes and then released after reporting I felt ok then.

                                                I have chronic Lyme disease, with extreme symptoms of photosensitivity and photophobia.  12 years ago, I had a series of intravenous antibiotics for 9 months.  That halted the progression of the symptoms.  However, with the first injection of the Pfizer vaccine, I had an immediate and increasing photosensitivity/photophobia.  For example, my computer monitor was at 6% brightness.  I reset to 3% brightness, which is still too bright.  My concern is that the second injection due on February 12th may further increase the symptoms.  My Lyme doctor believes that the light sensitivity is perhaps coming from the thalamus.  Additionally, the injection seemed to increase my INR.

                                                12/21/2020 I had my first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and the second on 1/13/2021. Two days after my second vaccine on 1/15/2021 at 8:50 PM I had a scintillating scotoma in my right visual field in both eyes consisting of a bright flash of light in the center of my visual field that cleared but then it expanded into a C-shaped series of zig-zag lines that slowly expanded into the periphery of both right visual fields. It ended at 9:20 PM. I had no headaches afterward. While I have had migraines when I was younger, I haven?t had one in several decades and I never had an aura before it.   I went to the ED where I was evaluated for a possible TIA and then admitted into Hospital. While there my platelet count was 400% of what it usually was.  Other than the platelet count and anemia (I donated 2 unit of packed red blood cells on 12/17/2020) the rest of my blood work was unrevealing.   The scintilating scotoma only lasted 30 minutes but the elevated platelets (although slowly coming down) continues to this day.

                                                According to staff....Recipient received the above vaccination and went to sit for 30 minutes.  He had already explained to the staff that he had had previous reactions to bee stings that required epinephrine so the nurse practitioner had  instructed him that he was to wait for 30 minutes vs the usual 15 minutes.  It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

A 66-year-old male received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that he was having some symptoms that has got worse and wanted to know if he should do something and wanted to know something what went with his eyes. His right eye was blood shot, it was red and daily amount of light that hits his eye was very painful so he had to keep his eyes closed to keep light from coming in so he won&#39;t be in pain. Patient was not able to give the lot number because it hurts too much when he tried to turn on the light to reach that (vaccine). Events started on Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine in my left arm on Jan. 23rd. I had no side effects at the time, other than a sore arm, as with any shot. However, two days later I lost all hearing in my left ear. I had no history of ear infections or other ear or hearing problems, except for wax buildup two or three times. On Jan. 26th, I saw an ENT. To my dismay, there was no wax. He prescribed the standard treatment of Prednisone for Sudden Idiopathic Hearing Loss. No change after the first round, so I had a second round, and also had the series of three ear injections with Dexamethasone. Had an MRI, as well, which was normal. A couple of weeks into all this, I began to have a bit of sound-generated static in my ear, and this continues today. (Fortunately, I?ve only had the most minor of tinnitus in that ear, and even it is pretty much gone now.)

The patient reported that he called 911 a few days later and was told the same thing. This episode occurs at least 3-4 times per week and lasts for about an hour and then goes away. Treatment was not received for the events. The events of Throbbing of tongue and tingling, Tingling around eye and nose, little dizzy required Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Since the vaccination, the patient was tested for COVID-19 (Antibody test as well as nasal swab) on 12Feb2021 with negative result. The clinical outcome of the events throbbing of tongue and tingling, tingling around eye and nose, little dizzy and Stuffiness was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                I got my first Pfizer COVID shot on March 2.  On March 9 I had an episode of double vision for a couple of minutes but it went away. On March 10 it returned and worsened such that when I looked to the left my vision had a magnifying effect. After consulting with my Ophthalmologist and my primary physician it was decided that I should not at this time get my second shot scheduled for March 23 due to potential exacerbating problems from my March 2 first shot.  Further it was seen that my blood glucose was showing me diabetic for which I have begun medical treatment for type 2 diabetes.

                                                Mouth began to quiver/drool; was able to walk inside from outdoors; had been happening about 2 =3 minutes before I realized what was happening.  Was standing so had him continue to do so while I held onto him to let the event pass.  Recovered within 5 minutes with no adverse affects.  Has been 1.5 years since any previous seizures so wanted to report this for fyi.

Long time delays occurred while scheduling further testing (CT and MRI). Summary from MRI:  &#34;Study Result Impression:  There is diffusion restriction along the left thalamus consistent with subacute ischemia, greater than 6 hours in etiology but less than 2 weeks.&#34;  Outcome:  Vision is slowly improving, headache is mostly gone, vertigo &amp;  mental status slowly improving.

PMHx notable for multiple prior TIAa, HTN, HLD, PVD c/b R femoral artery thrombus (2017, no intervention, on Plavix), T2DM (prior A1c 6.5%, recently 6.2% not on meds), COPD, prior splenectomy (childhood re: car accident), chronic L ulnar neuropathy, bilateral hearing loss, complex partial seizure disorder following Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Symptoms resolved fully within 24 hours of event; diagnosed with TIA. MRI without new ischemic findings; chronic small vessel disease and chronic small R cerebellar stroke noted. TIA likely occurred in setting of hypertensive event with systolic BP to 220s. ED attending reported an NIHSS of 9. Of note, blood pressure was in the 210s systolic on admission, and subsequently down trended. Per resident, initially had left gaze deviation however on exam had full ocular motility. Pupils were of equal (size: OD 3, S 3) and reactive. Ocular motility was full without nystagmus. Facial sensation normal. Initial mild left facial droop, which also resolved. As the exam progressed, the patient&#39;s symptoms began resolving. Patient was able to articulate his thoughts better without dysarthria and strength markedly improved in the left upper and lower extremities to full 5/5 strength within about 30-45 minutes. NIHSS improved from 9-1. Of note, the patient reported having several episodes similar in nature, in the setting of significant hypertension as well. Denied ever having a true stroke in the past.

                                                On April 11 at 1AM I noticed the light coming through the window was unusually dim.  I glanced at the smoke detector light and noticed it was dim.  Normally this light illuminated the nearby wall but I was barely able to see the light.  My illuminated clock also was clearly dimmer than usual.  It was as if my pupils were not adjusting to the dark.  This symptom subsided last night and my night vision is now normal.

She reports premedicating herself before the vaccination with 1 Pepcid and 2 Benadryl.  However unfortunately within 13 minutes of receiving the vaccine she started to experience a and irritation of the tongue/throat with tingling sensation followed by throat hoarseness, a cough and a red face.  She was experiencing a little bit of chest tightness in addition to a little bit of shortness of breath and therefore used her albuterol inhaler.  Shortly thereafter her red face improved.  EMS was called to the scene however by the time they arrived she was improving and was sent home.  She took a Benadryl at home later in the evening and the following day on Friday she started Pepcid daily since that time. She states since the vaccine she has felt poorly describing exhaustion and feeling achy all over with continued raw throat.  She has not warranted use of her albuterol inhaler since last Thursday and ran out of Benadryl Thursday evening only utilizing Pepcid daily and continues on her other medications. She reports a history of allergies to petroleum products including polyethylene glycol which is suspected to be the cause of her allergic reaction

A 66-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955) on 18Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blocked artery that can&#39;t put a stent. None family medical history. None other vaccines administered on same date. Last vaccines were 50 years ago as a child and there were no issues. After his first dose, patient was asked to sit for 15 minutes and he was fine and got in the car and drove home which takes 5-7 minutes and by the time he got home, he had a big old puffy bag under his right eye which drew his attention to look in the mirror and he saw his face was swelling. It started under his right eye and his left eye is a little bit swollen and then on the side coming down to his nose and all the way down on his cheek, lymph nodes are swollen on both sides as well. He went to the pharmacist and they told him they don&#39;t recommend him taking anything so he left it alone thinking it would be gone when he woke up. His daughter asked him called an ambulance, so he did that at 2:00-3:00a.m. When they came they said that there is no swelling any other place, they could recommend to take Benadryl, following morning he got the tablets and has taken all 24 and it is still there. No emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I couldn&#39;t sleep for many days and still have trouble after all this time.   The pulsating is non stop... 24/7.   I am doing my best to live with this but it is unbearable at times, to the point of driving me close to insanity.  I have some days where it is bearable, but never goes away.  I would have never gotten the covid-19 shot had I known that the adverse effect would have been this bad.   I has all but ruined my way of life up to this point.

                                                I have been sick since the day after the first the first Pfizer shot. 24 hour head ache, drowsy, lost concentration, ringing in my ears and just cant seem to wake up. I have been to the doctor three times and had mutable blood labs, and am now seeing a neurologist who has ordered a MRI of my brain. The problem is none of the doctors have any experience dealing with these adverse symptoms from the injection, does anybody? So who is going to help me before the lights go completely out?????

A 66-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm upper muscle on 02Apr2021 11:45 at age of 66-year-old (Lot Number: ER8737) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT number was EN6204) for Covid-19 immunisation in Mar2021, at age of 66-year-old and experienced pain in the arm. Medical history included Barrett&#39;s esophagus, Diverticulitis, Gastrooesophageal reflux disease, Generalised anxiety disorder, Cataracts, Kidney stones, Chlamydial infection, Left ventricular hypertrophy, Vertigo, hiatal hernia repair done, hypertension, had a colonoscopy quite often in another words to remove the polyps from his colon. Concomitant medication included omeprazole taken for GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient experienced atrial fibrillation on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, mild stroke on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, went totally blind in my left eye on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, probably got macular degeneration on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, pain in the arm on 02Apr2021 with outcome of unknown , my skin was kind of different looking you know like aging a little bit you know like wrinkling on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown , seeing flash burn every once in a while on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown , have a obstruction in the main artery of left eye on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CAT scan and EKG both with unknown results on 24May2021. The events result in Physician Office Visit, no treatment was received.  Clinical course: Consumer stated, &#34;Well, I got my first Pfizer shot I just thought I should just call and discuss this with somebody bit of some sheet I got I got the Pfizer vaccine and I got that one on 15Mar2021 the first one and then I received the second one 02Apr2021 and when after I received the second one I had the pain in the arm like normal but it was a lot more severe than I got from the first one but it went away but you know normal 3 to 4 days it went away so I did not wasn&#39;t that concerned but I also know this to ask. After I got my skin was kind of different looking you know like aging a little bit you know like wrinkling but then all of a sudden it cleared up too that went away probably about the same time a week after I got the shot I started having vision problem(distorted voice and incomplete sentence). I visited an ophthalmologist an regular eye doctor it was an ophthalmologist (distorted voice and incomplete sentence) and he said no I don&#39;t see that you have a stroke I don&#39;t see that you have vision problems with your retina this time you probably got macular degeneration going on so anyways he said comeback if you have an issue then I said so you are telling me that even though my vision is going in my left eye I am not gonna go blind and I didn&#39;t have a stroke he said yes. Ok, so anyways exactly a month after that I went totally blind in my left eye my vision came back, my vision came back. I forgot to tell you my vision came back fully for a while but it was different in my left eye like I was seeing flash burn every once in a while when I was in the sunlight and stuff. Anyway a month later after I got the second shot when I went totally blind in my left eye and so I got upset about the doctor&#39;s here and I had to go to (Address) to pick my new eyeglasses anyway so I had to drive to (Address) with one eye which is 230 miles from me anyways, so when I got my glasses there at they were the right prescription thank god and I told them about the eye issue so they didn&#39;t throw a eye test really thorough and said yes I definitely see a problem in your left eye looks like a flash burn or something like that so then they had me setup an appointment with really good ophthalmologist in (Address) because I wanted a second opinion whether my insurance covered it or not. So I went to this retinal specialist and I was in his office for like 3 hours they were checking me out in there you know he said yes definitely you have an obstruction in the main artery of your left eye and that&#39;s why you lost your vision and this doctor said there&#39;s only two things it could be it it could be you had a stroke or that you had a bad reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and so anyway he wanted me to go either into the emergency room a good (Address) to further do testing, I said no I don&#39;t wanna do that because that&#39;s all out of my own pocket that would have been thousands of dollars you know, but I don&#39;t know I am all confused about this medical care. I am just trying to give you all a scenario from day 1 going forward you know anyway so I refused to go to good (Name) and he said well it should be okay anyway because it&#39;s been so much time since the original problem that you would be probably alright to just back to your hometown there and go to the hospital and have your testing then there I did and the next day I got back to (Address) from (Address) I went  to the hospital there they did an EKG on my heart and they did a CAT scan on my head and they said they couldn&#39;t see anything from the EKG or the CAT scan that I had but that doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t have(Incomplete sentence), so they said you could have a mild stroke and you know anyway we want you to go further testing well I had a primary care physician appointment two weeks later which is still coming up so I have to her so they want to order an MRI and some other tests on my heart because they think I have might have an AFib atrial fibrillation where the blockage I mean where the blood flow properly to my heart you know if I want to do those tests too but I am just letting you know this cause the one doctor said it could be that you have the eye problem because of the vaccine that&#39;s what I am calling you about.&#34; Consumer Stated, &#34;Yes, you can follow up sure because I am more anyway cause on the 09June2021 I have an appointment with my primary care physician which is the one that have to do the order in heart chest and the MRI and the following week. I am going back to (Address) to that Ophthalmologist that said that it might because of Pfizer vaccine I am going back to him I got a follow up with him because he wants to me to take care of my eye issue so maybe I can get my eye sight back in other words or so.&#34; Date adverse event started: Consumer stated, &#34;I had my first shot on Friday 02Apr2021. The exact day that I started having issues was exactly one week later on 09Apr2021. Other than the normal you now pain in the arms because that started and went away normal that started you know. Well that started basically right after I got the shot on 02Apr2021 with the pain and the arm thing that was right after I got the shot 02Apr2021 and it was the little bit more severe than the original shot. 09Apr2021 is when I stated having eye problem.&#34; Anatomical Sites of administered: Consumer Stated, &#34;The first one I had them do it in my right arm in the muscle top in my right arm and the second one was done in the left arm upper muscle.&#34; Other Medical Conditions: Consumer Stated, &#34;Nothing life threatening but I have chronic health conditions, quite a few of them. I got Barrett&#39;s esophagus, then Diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon then electro cardiogram(Further not clarified) they did was abnormal they said. I got GRD Gastroesophageal reflux disease. I got generalized anxiety disorder, GAD. I have Cataracts. They said I had a genital disorder I don&#39;t know what that means. I got history of Calculus in the kidneys, kidney stones but I haven&#39;t had a problem with that from quite a while, I changed my diet. I have past Chlamydial infection which is an STD. I had hiatal hernia repair done, so surgery. I have hypertension disorder they say, left ventricular hypertrophy which I guess has something to do with the heart, I think that&#39;s why they wanna do more test of my heart. I got polyps in colon (Further not clarified) and occasionally I get Vertigo so I have to have a colonoscopy quite often in another words to remove the polyps from my colon.&#34; Treatment medication for medical conditions: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well they only I take Vitamin D3 and I take Vitamin C but that&#39;s vitamins basically the only meds and I am taking. I am using Eye Drops right now over the counter stuff basically the only meds I really take is Omeprazole which is for my GRD disorder you know my gas my stomach gas it controls my stomach gas and then extra strength Tylenol I take that as needed sometimes.&#34; Start date of taking the medication: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well the Omeprazole I probably been taking that for 10 years at least 8 years or 7 years. I really couldn&#39;t give that to you without going through a pile of paper work.&#34; When asked about if consumer is taking any other medication, consumer Stated, &#34;No, Just Omeprazole.&#34; Lab test: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well they did an EKG and they did a CT scan and that was just recently because of my issue that I got right now going on. Yeah, that was done at (Name).&#34; Date of test: 24May2021. Result of test: Consumer Stated, &#34;Only the doctor has that I don&#39;t have that I have to go to my primary physician on 09May2021 to get those results.&#34; Event Details: Event Date: Consumer Stated, &#34;When I had the first shot I didn&#39;t have any side effects at all except for the minor arm pain.&#34; When confirmed event date as 02Apr2021 and 09Apr2021, consumer stated, &#34;Yes that&#39;s when I started having adverse side effects.&#34; Still experiencing the problem: Consumer Stated, &#34;Yeah, I am still blind in my left eye yes.&#34; Outcome: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well I don&#39;t know it&#39;s kind of early if they are gonna improve or not they want to do more testing the doctor know more when they did more tests I don&#39;t have all the information because they still doing test on me to figure out what&#39;s going on but I decided to call you know before it got too late in the whole situation you know.&#34; Treatment: Consumer took for the adverse events consumer stated, &#34;No I don&#39;t think they gave me any drugs or anything for the tests.&#34; Consumer hung up abruptly hence further probing could not be done.

                                                Ringing/pulsating sound began in my right ear about 8 days after second Pfizer vaccine shot. It still persists to today, July 3,2021.  I originally thought it was a condition associated with my Bell?s palsy that began on February 7, 2021 three days after my first Pfizer vaccine shot. But now I?m not sure. Saw my general practice doctor yesterday on July 2nd  and she felt that the tinnitus may be separate from the Bell?s palsy. My usual doctor was out for the day. She prescribed a nasal spray which I have not received as of yet. I also went to see the doctor do to a rib injury. The tinnitus may be lessening the past ten days or so, but still very present all day long.

                                                On June 01, 2020 during morning hours, my left eye was starting  get watery and the upper eye lid felt heavy. Also the left side of my mouth commissure started to feel weak and hanging down.. The left border of my tongue was numb and I had a stabbing like headache on the left side of the back of the head. My left hand, finger number 4 and 5, felt numb and in my left foot I felt constant electric shocks. I also was having balance disorders, making me almost fall many times.

                                                About 4 hours after my 2nd dose, I was driving on my way home and all of a sudden I felt like I was hallucinating. I saw what looked like a bug infestation coming across my vision line. It was a swarm of black spots. I had to stop and re-evaluate my situation on the way home. When I gained control again, I realized it wasn&#39;t a hallucination. It was my actual vision. When I got home I basically crashed for the rest of the day. The next day I contacted my optometrist and I went in for an evaluation. They said it was a cloud of floaters. I asked if there was any chance that it was a side effect of the vaccine. They told me no. They sent me to an ophthalmologist. He told me that it will never go away. I went back to my optometrist and they said it would go away. All that they could come up with is that it is a coincidence. I have also had dizzy spells. They weren&#39;t strong, but it was like a constant dizziness. I still have all of the symptoms going on. The floaters in my eye seem like they are starting to dissipate. I have had some mild nausea. I can take a nap and it seems like it dissipates. This all came on at one time. I have been extremely tired lately. I take 2-3 naps a day and that is just not like me. It&#39;s like the feeling of being hungover, but I haven&#39;t had a drink in months.

                                                I started waking up in the morning seeing fireworks in my left eye, which is weaker than my right one. By Sunday, it was getting worse. I held my hand my right eye to measure the eye sight of my left eye. I could see a line cutting through my line of vision; I could see above the line, but couldn&#39;t see anything below the line. I went to a clinic and was referred to a retina specialist. They called a Neural Ophthalmologist and asked if I could be seen that day. I went to the neural ophthalmologist who knew exactly what the problem was and how to treat it. I was diagnosed with NAION (Non-Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy) where half of one eye loses vision. He prescribed three medications and a low dose aspirin to reduce swelling around my optic nerve.

I could see redness across my chests and upper shoulders both sides have a reddish rash which does itch. I?ve had to buy anti itch cream.  And today 24 hours after my injection my upper lip started to swell up and soon my lower lip swelled up and went numb.. even affecting my nostril area.

                                                transient bilateral blurry vision; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.  A 67-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (Patient age and high risk medically).  Medical history included ongoing spastic paraplegia.  He has a genetic neurological condition, he has it is called spastic paraplegia. He does not have an onset date just that it was years ago and is still an ongoing thing at this time. He believes there is a remote family history of the same neurological condition. Patient is not diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient previously took flu vaccine on 18Nov2020, almost 2 months prior. The patient experienced transient bilateral blurry vision on 11Jan2021 11:20.  Caller is asking for recommendations regarding the 2nd dose for the patient who experienced blurriness of vision. Caller reporting a patient who received the first dose of the Vaccine yesterday (11Jan2021) and developed transient bilateral blurry vision at 11:00am, 20-30 mins after the dose. He said that it was resolved within 18-24 hrs after. He is asking if there were any reports of this in the clinical trial. It was further reported that caller is calling about the COVID vaccine. He says he was curious, he is a clinical director in (and he was calling to report or see if anyone had reported this. The patient received his first dose of the vaccine yesterday (11Jan2021) and for less than 24 hours had transient bilateral blurry vision. He says by the second day it had totally resolved. It started about 20 minutes after the first dose and resolved within 24 hours. He did not think it met criteria to report but he wondered if they would like to him report that and see if anyone had seen that at all. Event began on 11Jan2021 about 15-20 minutes after the vaccine was given and was resolved completely within 24 hours. For the dose, he believed the patient received 0.3 ml, whatever the standard dose is. He thought the Pfizer one is 0.3 ml. He says the nurses do that he just does the medical screening but he thinks the Pfizer one is 0.3 ml and (name) is 0.5 ml but he is older so he may be wrong. No further information provided. For the anatomical location of administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, he stated it was on one of the deltoids, he is not sure which. Vaccination Facility Type was outpatient clinic. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, they screen for those and he has not had any other vaccines for at least 2 weeks. It was further reported that vaccine given roughly about 11 AM and the symptoms began 11:20 AM. He called the patient this morning at 9:30 AM and he said the blurry had resolved. He says he spoke with the patient&#39;s wife and she asked the patient if it was resolved and he said yes. They did not provide the caller with the time that the blurry vision resolved. Caller says he did send the patient to their in house optometrist for an exam and the exam was unremarkable by the optometrist. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He also wanted to know if they could advise whether or not to give the second dose. The outcome of the event was recovered on 12Jan2021.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                swelling on his lower gums; sensitivity to his teeth; redness on his gums; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284), via intramuscular route of administration on 14Jan2021 at 12:40 at 0.3 mL, single in the deltoid left for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140) on 23Dec2020 at 0.3 ml IM injection for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021, the patient experienced swelling on his lower gums in the front of his mouth and sensitivity to his teeth, no other symptoms. The swelling gums went away, it was mild and it went away. A few hours after, there was redness on his gums, no drainage or anything and then the teeth sensitivity went away through the day. He was wondering if those things have been associated with the product or maybe just a coincidence. The patient recovered from the events swelling on his lower gums and sensitivity to his teeth on 15Jan2021 while unknown for the other event.

Resolved after 150 minutes.  Interestingly, 8 days after the first dose (lot number EL 3247) had a similar but slightly milder reaction that lasted 24 hours. I do have Meniere?s with intermittent episodes like this for many years, but these two events were profoundly more severe than any in the past.

Took him to medical center where, after CT scan and blood work, he was diagnosed with Bell?s palsy. Unfortunately the treatment for this is a steroid and antiviral medication. By Sunday night he was exhibiting signs of mania.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

Caller states last night he wasn&#39;t swallowing because the food was stopping at his throat because of the blockage, so he drank 6 cans of Pepsi to blow it through. States on Monday, he was going for COVID test, because they won&#39;t take him unless he has the test. Caller states last time he went to hospital for breathing, they made him suck 2 nebulizers and then he did two on his own and sat down and relaxed and he was okay after that.

                                                1) On or about 2/9/2021 I began running a low grade fever daily of approximately 99.5 starting every day at 3:00 PM lasting until after midnight.  The fevers continued daily until approximately 2/26/2021. 2)  On or about 2/19/2021 I began to show a red spotted rash UNDERNEATH my skin.  The rash covered all my torso up to my neck, my arms to my wrist, and my legs to my ankles.  The rash mostly subsided within about two weeks however to this day I still show some mild traces of this rash on my torso.   Please see continuation page below.                Please see continuation page below.3)  On or about 3/4/2021 I began to notice a ringing in both my years, this has continued continuously 24 hours a day, to this date. It seems to inhibit my hearing acuity.  To this day my hearing seems to be diminishing at noticeable daily rate.   4)  On or about 3/7/2021 I began to notice an impairment in my vision.  This impairment is manifested in both eyes equally as a washed out field of vision making it hard to read and discern fine details. At times I also see some small sparkles in my vision and dark impairments (not floaters) that seem to last up to a few minutes and then disappear. These impairments occur at random times during the day for no apparent reason.  To this day my vision seems to be diminishing at a noticeable daily rate. On 2/19/2021 I received an eye exam and at that time, my vision was normal and was diagnosed as such.

                                                Have had a significant change to the way my long standing allergies manifest themselves.  Since early childhood they would manifest  with congestion and wheezing - typical asthmatic reaction to allergies. Now I am getting rashes and most importantly watery eyes.  I have never had watery eyes except in the most severe allergenic reactions like from peanuts or shellfish (anaphylactic shock) - and only for very short periods.  Now I am getting watery eyes. from even minor food and pollen allergenic reactions.  While not with the frequency of the watery eyes I am also getting rashes.  The watery eyes are to the point when I wake up in the morning my eyes are glued shut.  I never have had these reactions before.  Note: I waited several months to report this because I was hoping it was random events - the events are not random and nothing I have experienced in my 67 years before the vaccination.  With the long term health problems I have I am keenly aware of my allergenic  reactions.  I have always had them but never before with watery eyes and occasional rashes.

The patient further reported that he went to his doctor and they said to take Benadryl and he has been taking it and he was due for second shot this Wednesday and was wondering should he get it. He also stated that used to be 6&#39;6&#34;, but as he gets older, he has shrunk. He did not provide his height now and he shrunk before he got the vaccine and mentioned that over time everyone gets shorter as disc gets compressed. He also stated that he was on an antibiotic for a sty on left eyelid for 5 days and he took first one Monday and Tuesday and got COVID shot on Wednesday and then a couple of days after, maybe a day or two or three, his face did not hurt, but when he went to floss his teeth, when he put fingers in mouth on left side, the side of face hurt a little bit. A couple of days later, it moved into his lips and he did not have a lot or expiration for the azithromycin as it was in a pharmacy vial and they told him to come back in 4 weeks, which would be this Wednesday. He called drug store on 02 Apr 2021 and they said to call physician and he called them on Friday and got a call to come in on 06 Apr and told him to take Benadryl. He stated that he was kind of skinny and when you see people in TV when they give injections, they grab the skin in the arm. There was not a whole lot of meat or muscle in his shoulder to grab, from his left shoulder down to elbow, he had a black and blue bruise from inside of elbow up to shoulder and he noticed it a couple of days later. There was still some of it there. He stated the start date was a day or two later after 17Mar2021. It was finally fading away and turning lighter and lighter. It was like most of it has gone, but you can still see some of it. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events with Benadryl. The patient was recovering from the events of contusion, lip pain and facial pain and outcome was unknown for the other events.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                The first dose was administered at 3:00 pm on 03/02/2021, and symptoms occurred at approximately 7:00 am on 03/03/2021. They included loss of hearing in both ears and an intensification of Meniere&#39;s Disease in both ears. I became totally deaf in my left ear and over 50% deaf in my right ear. The Meniere&#39;s symptom of ringing became almost intolerable. I went to my audiologist after several weeks to get my hearing aids turned up and adjusted. At that time, my audiologist advised my right ear had gone from 26% deaf to over 50% deaf and adjusted that hearing aid. The left ear is still over 62% deaf and the Meniere&#39;s Disease ringing has not lessened. The hearing in the right ear improved somewhat over a two month period after the second shot was administered.

A 67-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot/batch number: EW0173) via unspecified route in the left arm on 06May2021 (at the age of 67-years) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported but reporter stated that patient was on several medications like hypertension, but reporter did not want to give full medical history here. Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 Immunization. Patient did have underlying conditions (history). Reporter concern was, something had to be done with the vaccine because after few weeks, patient started seeing a floater in his eyes, then he was like seeing all the blank, black things. Within couple of weeks (second or third week) (in May2021), patient started losing his eyesight. Reporter meant it was pretty gradually. Patient went to optometrist and ophthalmologist right away, they went to &#39;retinopathy&#39; and they were trying to figure it out why all of sudden patient experienced it and then they realized that it just happened after couple of weeks, after the vaccine. The clinical outcome for the events was unknown. Patient had a lab test like a month ago or something.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

It stopped my heart and I was driving and totaled my car. I have a pacemaker now and barely survived, and that was two months ago. I contacted the governs office, my doctor, both federal centers and Pfizer is not hearing about it.  I was pretty much dead and revived, everyone is saying there&#39;s no red flag, it&#39;s crucial to hear what I have to say, I contact Pfizer I was pretty much dead. I&#39;ve been trying to reach someone since the second week in February, over a month and a half now.  I have dealt wit h brain fog for three months, issues with writing, had noise in my ears that wakes me from my sleep and sometimes unbearable.

No tachycardia as he was checking his Apple Watch and no other symptoms.  ? 10:20 he drove home and called his wife can kept her on the call as he drove. He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient&#39;s wife.  A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke on an unknown date. It was also reported that the patient was exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19 after receiving the vaccination (Jan2021); but the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Concomitant medications were not reported.  In Jan2021, after the vaccination, the patient experienced watery eyes, runny nose, a slight cough, and stomach pain.  The patient went to the walk-in clinic for the watery eyes and runny nose. He was given unspecified medication for the slight cough.  The clinical outcomes of the watery eyes, runny nose, and slight cough were recovered in Jan2021; while that of the stomach pain was not recovered.    The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Immediately felt light headed, like seeing double and I can&#39;t explain it. It is still continuing now but not as bad.  The next day I had chills and my fever went up to 101, I took about 6 Tylenol and 6 Advil to bring the fever down. The following day I was feeling better. The yesterday I woke up with a weird feeling on the left side of my lower lip, it is like numbness, like just it feels weird.  I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.

Also feels like hearing ability is affected due to tinnitus sensation that is continuous 24/7. It has not diminished and is not getting better as of date of this report. I do not know if I should ghet another shot as do not want to lose my hearing. Will schedule an appointment with my ENT. I do not want to go deaf from this vaccine.

                                                Two days after the second injection, two areas that were low-level pain providers - dental thermal sensitivity (hot and cold) and a slight discomfort in my right, repaired shoulder - rocketed up the pain index.  I could not tolerate even tepid tea, and I was unable to raise my right arm high enough to grasp a car steering wheel.  This lasted, getting worse Sunday, through Monday, and into Tuesday morning.  That afternoon i noticed the discomfort in both areas lessening, and by Wednesday evening, had resumed their baseline sensitivities.

I was diagnosed April 1 with a blood clot in my retina that has changed my vision from 20/30 in that eye to 20/125.  My left eye remains 20/20.  I&#39;m in excellent health and never had any kind of clot or eye issue.  The traditional causes of Retinal Vein Occulosis don&#39;t pertain to me - no heart trouble, high blood pressure or diabetes.  I&#39;m thin and physically active, never smoked, drank or used drugs.

I didn&#39;t connect the two until a few months later (still have it) that I recalled sitting down to do a Calm app meditation where you rate your experience at the end and I remembered was the first time I noticed it. I didn&#39;t complete the meditation because the ringing was bothering me and I rated it with a &#34;frowny face&#34;. When I went to the app to check, it was the week after the vaccine.

I was getting worried about 6pm, my resting heart rate was about 80 bpm, if felt pressure on my chest and the palpitations felt strong. Then, my teeth on the left side of my mouth really started hurting, like someone was trying to pull them out.  That is when I went to ER

He was in his car and thought he had put his car in park, but it was in neutral and he hit another car, which he thought he was hit.  The gentleman informed him that he was the one that hit him as he had watched him slowly advance to hitting him.  He did not know or was aware that he was even moving.  He has headaches normally but they have gotten worse since then.   He also has motion sickness but has learned to deal with it and get used to the side effects.  He also has blurry vision and just not feeling normal.  He did go see his PCP and she put him on Meclizine for the dizziness, which works about 50%, but not completely.     He did have the 2nd vaccine on 2/22/21 and still had the symptoms, which have stayed since then as well.  He then saw his PCP a week ago and she is scheduling for a CT scan to see if he has any blood clots.    He did have an aneurysm in his brain 28 years ago and they felt that he would not be able to survive it and deemed that he would be left as a vegetable, but has survived that and does have a little residual headache, but nothing severe.   He now is still having these three symptoms that he did not have prior to the vaccine.

On 1/24/2021 and 1/25/2021 I noticed a pressure and hearing problems in my ears. On 1/26/2021 I went to urgent care, he examined me and he thought I had ETD (tube disfunction). I relayed my concerns about my recent covid vaccine and he said not to be concerned about that. He recommended taking Flonase and Sudafed. The problem came and went periodically. I saw another DR and they did a base hearing test done. on 2/22/2021 the problem seemed to be resolved upon waking up in the morning. On 2/23/2021, it was back with a lot of pressure in the ears. A hearing test revealed at my next appnt that there was hearing loss. At that time it was a possible cochlear issue, they were not sure. I have been symptom free now for about three months,

A 68-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Mar2021 at around 13:00 (as reported) as dose 2, single (at the age of 68-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history was not reported. The concomitant medications included amitriptyline had been on for 20 years, patient takes as needed because he was in a bad car accident at a dose of 10 mg, butalbital, caffeine, paracetamol (FIORICET), cyclobenzaprine, had been on for 20 years at a dose of 10 mg taken for headache. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 09Feb2021 at around 14:00 (as reported) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (First dose last 09Feb2021 &amp; Second dose on 02Mar2021). He reported to have had a metallic taste and smell, like a diesel engine. Patient mentioned he was unsure when this started but it had been 3 months already. He also stated that he saw a physician, but he still wanted to know if it had been reported. He had an awful taste and smells the same odor. It had been a few months with the metallic taste in his mouth. Patient added that diesel taste and smell started about the time that they got the shots. Patient stated that he did say it was metallic earlier but he would not say it was metallic, he thought that people who do not have experience say it was metallic. He stated it was more like diesel fumes and a bitter taste that he tastes and smells. He did not know when this started but stated that it just stays the same. Patient was asked when symptoms started and he stated he could not really say that. He never thought about it until the last months or so he noticed he had it for a while. He smelled the same odor and taste if that makes any sense because taste and smell are related. Patient added he had never been sick or had any childhood diseases. He wanted to know if it was something because the doctor wants to test his kidney and liver. He had no health problems. He had bloodwork a month before the vaccines and everything was fine and they want to use him as a lab rat right now. Description of Product Complaint included patient was discussing the treatment for his diesel-like taste and smell that he was experiencing for a while. The doctor gave him a pantoprazole 40 mg for acid reflux. The adverse events resulted in physician office visit but not the emergency room visit. Patient received pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg for acid reflux. The outcome of the events was not resolved.   Additional information about batch/lot has been requested.

However  two weeks  after the first shot   I woke up  at 2:oo in the morning with the noise in my head. I thought I was going to get a struck and I was no able to sleep after that. I have to wait for the weekend to be over. I make an appointment with the doctor and I get referrals to a cardiologist and a ENT.  I got US of my carotid artery both sides with normal results. I had a hearing test and they said I has lost of hearing but in my daily life I have not experience problem with my hearing. The ENT sent me for an MRI of the brain and inner ear but came out normal. Since April 14, 2021 I can not sleep at night because of the ringing in my ear.  I spoke with others with this problem after the vaccine and I check on line and learn about others with similar effects and for that reason I am sending this report.

                                                About 4 hours after the second dose I began the most intense headache I have ever had.  I kept expecting it to go away.  After 10 days of enduring this I went to the ER.  I was admitted with blood clots and bleeding from the face. (but probably more wrong)  I was initially treated for a PE and meds to try to stop the headache.  Nothing seemed to work.  About 3 days into the hospital stay, my pre-existing Stills disorder began to show.  I was then treated with 60mg of prednisone daily to control the Stills.  About the same time, we discovered that a standard migraine medicine would control the extreme headache, morphine would not.  My CRP results were off the charts and almost 4 months later it is still high.  My treating doc says 2 more months of prednisone treatment.  I had an immediate weight loss of 25 pounds in the hospital.  I am struggling to this day to put the weight back on.  I have lost hearing in my left ear as a result.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

I originally contributed the blisters to sunburn because I had been in the sun a lot the previous three days but I&#39;ve worked outside for years and I have never had my lip swell or had blisters on them in the past.  I have not been to a doctor at this point because the blisters appear to be healing so the blisters have not been diaganosed as being a covid vaccine reaction.

A 69-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6206 and Expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 12Mar2021 10:45 (at the age of 69-years-old) as 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, seasonal allergies (He controlled them with Zyrtec), hypertension-mild and pollen and grass allergies. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included amlodipine/losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for high blood pressure. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12Mar2021, 13:15 the patient eyes began to water and itch, slightly blurred vision, discharge in both eyes, sensitive to light, substantial fatigue. The patient had 2 major side effects. Both occurred about 2 hours after getting the vaccination. Both worsened as the day went on. The patient had involuntary squint because of itchy and watering eyes, dried discharge closing eyes in morning upon rising. They got significantly worse the following day. His eyes began to water and itch, and vision got slightly blurry. He attributed that to his eyes watering constantly. He does not wear glasses and has close to 20/20 even though he was old. He looks at computer and reads a lot. It got worse until Monday, then it abated slightly. It was still substantial. The right eye was worse than left. Two hours after watery and itching, he did not notice any blurry vision. That was later in the afternoon. As he was writing documents on computer and reading printed material was when he noticed it. There was enough discharge from the watering and tearing that when you wake up, you feel your eyes are glued closed. It has improved slightly in one eye. But it was the same or worse in right eye. Sensitivity to light began around 2 hours after the vaccination while he was in the car driving. Substantial fatigue got worse that night and was moderately bad Saturday, Sunday and Monday. It had abated moderately yesterday and then was worse yesterday and today, but better than the weekend. IT comes and goes and is not continuous. He has never had malaria but thinks it was the same feeling of overwhelming fatigue. He does not have any previous pre-existing conditions. It began with the vaccination. He was not a person of hypochondria and was not particularly worried about this. He was not worried about dying. They are simple side effects with any vaccine. The patient was disturbed when he looked it up. He did not see any symptoms being advertised about eye problems and he was very educated about it. Then when he looked it up, he saw others that had the same thing if not worse. He does not have any information for people that experienced the same thing that he read about online on the internet. Many symptoms that people were reporting were much more severe such as: eyes puffy, face swelling and eyes itchy and crusty. He must have seen 30-35 on two websites that reported and many more on websites on the internet. He then said it could have been 35-40 that he read carefully. Everyone in his family had the vaccine. His son had first dose and experienced no real symptoms. His wife who is a nurse had it 3 weeks ago and only a mild twinge in her arm. She experienced some fatigue yesterday for second dose. It was not really important and nothing that has not been reported. He did not wish to complete report. He was the healthiest person in the family, and he was surprised that he got these side effects. After he got the eye issues, he took Visine. Visine Advanced only clears were up for 10 minutes and then it comes right back. He only used it a few times because it was useless. If the vaccine had not blinded him, he could see the lot number easier. Lot is JJB0300 with expiration Sep2021. It was a total size of 0.284 ounces or 8ml. Visine Advanced gets rid of bloodshot eyes like for drunks. He does not drink though. He would not be willing to send a sample and it was sealed and intact. The patient uses the cetirizine (tablet, 10mg, Lot: 0EE27118 and Expiration date: Jan2022) oral from 13Mar2021 at 10mg twice a day taken for eye problems related to vaccine. The patient has been using and thought it might help with eye irritation. The patient took antihistamine as treatment for the events. The outcome of the event sensitive to light was recovering, eye irritation was unknown and other events were not recovered.

No additional noted after second shot which I had slightly over a month after first shot.

Until recently when I was at the movies with a friend and they really  expressed how much noise I was making. That&#39;s when I got the Allegra  Nothing  improved then I  was frying some chicken and noticed I could not smell it that much or anything else .. Unless I&#39;m being over whelmed by a smell I won&#39;t  smell it but yet my taste buds are just fine.

Incident 2:  4/14/2021 evening, noticed itching of left buttock - clear soft swelling which could be seen as a raised area; antihistamine treatment led to resolution.  Incident 3:  4/20/21 morning.  Eating breakfast and noticed left side of mouth especially tongue was numb/swollen, progressed to where had difficuty pronouncing words and was quite scary; took antihistamine and resolved over a couple of hours.  Seemed as though it was borderline anaphylaxis but did not progress to throat tightening or difficulty breathing.

A 69-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 12Feb2021 at 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at 69-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Medical history included blood pressure high (HBP) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-fib) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing; and relevant past drug history: Yes, as reported (no details provided). Concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; hydrochlorothiazide (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and others as reported. On 12Feb2021 at 14:00, the patient experienced: vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes) (hospitalization, medically significant), and dizziness, giddiness, lightheadedness (hospitalization).  The patient was hospitalized for the events for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CT): result was not provided on an unspecified date, echocardiogram: result was not provided on an unspecified date, Nasal Swab: negative on 24Apr2021 (post vaccination). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included CT and echocardiogram (as reported). The clinical outcome of the events: vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes) was recovered on an unspecified date. The clinical outcome of the events: dizziness, giddiness, lightheadedness was recovering.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association, a causal relationship between the reported events partial vision loss for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision and dizziness, and the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. The causality was confounded by the patients preexisting cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and atrial fibrillation and multiple concomitant medications.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It is present at this volume daily. Though I have inquired with various providers, seems there&#39;s no treatment. Also, not sure, but I have neuropathy in my fingers (from Diabetes?) which seems to have worsened at about the same time.. I have been getting it treated at a chiropractic office and still working on getting alternative treatment.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

                                                He had the vaccine, and around 5:00 PM said he had weakness and he fell to the floor.  Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

Left ear is currently normal.  I went to see PA  today and from her exam she indicated right ear drum looks normal.  Sinuses are somewhat swollen.  She wants me to use Afrin and Flonase for one week.  If that doesn&#39;t help, then low salt diet for one week.  If still no help, she will refer me to an ENT.

It has become a loud pitch ringing.  I looked up on line and have seen other people reporting the same issues. I hope this goes away because it&#39;s starting to affect the way I feel. My health has been excellent until this point!

I am a dialysis patient I had dialysis schedule for 10 the next morning but I didn&#39;t feel well enough to go so they gave me a time later on in the day which by that time I felt good. I was able to drive there and I was good so when I got done with dialysis I could not walk I was too weak to do anyting I had to have my daughter come and get me and drive me home. That had to be a reaction between the injection and the diabetes treatment when does dialysis treatment I&#39;m sorry but yeah then I felt bad the whole rest of the day and I didn&#39;t feel good again until the next morning which is now.

Patient stated he had the 2nd vaccine about 2 months ago and a month later he got tinnitus in both of his ears. Patient stated he didn&#39;t think it was the vaccine. Patient stated his hearing was perfect but the tinnitus interferes with his hearing. Patient stated it was a month and a half when the tinnitus came on, he woke in the morning and had noise in his ears and thought what was that he must be getting old and found that it didn&#39;t do that, it happened in one ear or the other it&#39;s never both ears equal amounts. Patient relayed that his left arm hurts really bad occasionally. It&#39;s been going on since it was put out with tinnitus and losing hearing since the beginning. Patient stated he contacted doctor about hearing loss and tinnitus and something going on. Patient stated when he lays down he had it too. Patient stated he was assuming the worse and he has permanently damaged nerve endings in his ears. Patient stated he saw a doctor, a specialist for a second opinion.

Patient stated he was told the CT looked great for his age and doctor said his hearing was real good and both doctors said his hearing was real good and they don&#39;t have a reason to explain it. Patient stated he would not take the vaccine if he knew about hearing loss and can&#39;t reverse the damage that is done. Patient stated he was not happy his hearing was screwed up and it&#39;s hard to fall asleep as he hears it all the time.

Follow-up (17Feb2021) was received from same reporter and processed together with initial information.   A 70-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) via unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 02:30 (at the age of 70-years) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE in arm left for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes, heart condition, blood cholesterol, stomach discomfort.

The patient got the second vaccine on 13Feb2021 at 02:30 and felt absolutely fine. The patient went to bed at 10:30 which is pretty typical, the patient got up to go to the bathroom and realized that he was walking really funny. The patient don&#39;t have a long walk to bathroom, it just came upon him that he was just walking very fine like his legs were going higher than normal (feet going too high) and kind of falling back down and this was very weird state. The patient thought on that, &#34;it seem to be a neurological symptom&#34;. The next day, the patient was just exhausted. The patient came down and laid on the couch and the patient literally could not get his muscles to move properly to get off the couch, the patient just couldn&#39;t do it, and patient&#39;s wife had to pick him up. The patient stated he was very capable and so for him to be immobilized like that was strange. The patient kept trying to figure out why, why can&#39;t he get off this couch. So, that night and the patient slept all day basically and that night the patient slept great. Following day, the patient got up and was still tired and the patient did manage to finally take a shower which he was wanting to do, which worked in the right direction for the patient. The patient also had a rash in his entire torso, thighs, sides and back. The patient stated two things one was that &#34;nerve seemingly neurological thing&#34; and another was that the patient&#39;s total upper body had rash and on torso sides and back. The patient denied having rash on arm. The patient had gold tooth and it just started hurting crazy and then after that his mouth was full of like little sores something like that. The patient was able to get rid of them using warm salt water. The patient had lost about 5 pounds. The patient also had headache and fever and he was taking ibuprofen for it. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                On the afternoon following second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I began to experience worsening of myasthenia symptoms, principally diplopia and difficulty with swallowing.  Symptoms persisted the following day and on third day following I experienced very severe fatigue in combination with diplopia, ptosis of both eyelids, right side weakness and trouble swallowing.  Called doctor, who increased prednisone and today symptoms have almost entirely abated.

Migraine intensity headaches started 4 hours after injection of the second dose and lasted for approx. 40 hours. Went to sleep at 10:30 PM the night of the second dose and woke up in a startled state every half hour until I got out of bed at 5:30 AM.   From 5:30 AM until approx. 10 PM the day after my second dose I experienced seizure-like symptoms where I would seem to fall asleep while in a sitting position and awake just a minute(s) later in a confused state of mind. This would happen frequently and stopped its frequency slowly and stopped entirely late that same night.   I experienced eye pain to the point I had to apply ice bags to my face the entire day after the second dose. Body pain was so sever I cannot compare it to any other flu-like symptoms I&#39;ve ever had.   Totally recovered after 48 hours.

Reports not seeking emergency treatment due to symptoms resolving.  recommended they make an appointment for their PCP and advise of occurrence. Also advised they needed to have a conversation with their physician to out weigh risks/benefits of continuing with the 2nd dose. Informed wife she needed to call 911 immediately if symptoms of numbness/tingling confusion, paralysis occurred. Informed her the nature of that being a time sensitive matter if symptoms began.

                                                pt had no sx until this morning.  Today pt woke up at 6am with tongue swollen and redness on one side of his tongue. no progression, no worsening, breathing ok and able to swallow.  Unable to confirm this is related to the vaccine, but possible. Since no progression and red area is only on one side of the tongue, I mentioned to also consider the possibility of sxs being due to him accidentally biting his tongue while sleeping. May take a dose of Benadryl-if indeed this is an allergy reaction, monitor yourself at home, f/u with pcp. Call 911 if any difficulty swallowing and/or difficulty breathing. Call back if any q. Will f/u.

Got hearing test on 2/15/21 which showed decreed hearing in right ear secondary to nerve conduction problem.  Within a few hours hearing got better, and hearing was retested the next day and found to be essentially back to normal.  I had taken Naprosyn on 2/15. MD had originally prescribed Prednisone bur I did not take since I was getting better without it. By 2/16/21 in the AM my hearing in the right ear seemed fine and there was no sense of fullness.

                                                noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all; he felt fullness in his right ear; sore left arm where he got injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pt would like provider to report this to the Vaccine reporting system, since he did have covid in December.  Pt did not do any reporting through V-Safe after getting his vaccine.

After doing considerable reading about this, ringing in the ears has been an all to common side effect of the covid vaccines. I have discovered that it is called tinnitis. Regardless of it&#39;s name, phizer &amp; the other covid vaccine makers need to solve this major problem for those of us who have it because of their covid vaccines. I have never had ringing in the ears ever before. I have always been in perfect health and have not taken prescription drugs.  I should have had only ONE covid vaccine shot

A 71-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 09:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization (Age at vaccination: 71 years). Medical history included transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode from Mar2021, blocked carotid artery on his left side and tinnitus (had a history of Tinnitus in his left ear for about 4 years but he could hear). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BAYER ASPIRIN) for carotid artery blockage. The reporter stated that the patient was completely deaf in his left ear and had hearing loss on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he had walked straight into half of a wall because he was so off kilted on 27Mar2021 . The wife thinks the patient is not hearing well out of his right ear on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he is shrinking a little and the patient has gained weight on an unspecified date. The reporter also says that she thought that her husband&#39;s side effects started a little late after the vaccine date, has that been reported? Her husband had made the mistake of getting on the internet even though she said not to do that. She jokingly says that her husband is like a medical manual and he thinks that he is going to die from everything. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included height: shrinking and weight: gained on an unspecified date and CAT scan and MRI: Transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode on Mar2021. Outcome of the event deafness and hearing decreased was not recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine#2, I began to notice my left ear &#39;filling up&#39; like a swimmer&#39;s ear, and by April 22 at 8:30 in the evening, all hearing in the left ear was gone.  Thinking it was a wax build-up, I saw a PA at our clinic on April 26 at 4:10 pm, who removed a slight amount of wax. Two days later on April 28 at the ENT clinic, I had a hearing test which showed extremely low hearing levels, compared with a hearing test completed at the same ENT clinic on March 8 - (this was a general hearing test which was &#39;normal&#39;).  The ENT PA explained my condition was not due to wax but possibly a small blood clot or tumor preventing blood flow to the inner ear.  An MRI has been scheduled and Prednizone 60 mg prescribed.  As I began the Prednizone treatment April 28, I began to wonder if this might be an adverse effect of the Covid-19 vaccine.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) dose 2 via an unspecified route of admin-istration on 07Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included diabetes mellitus; he does not take medication for it. It was controlled by diet and exercise, high blood pressure, high lipids, herpes zoster from Oct2019, bell&#39;s palsy from Oct2019, herpes zoster oticus from Oct2019, paralysis, vertigo, ear disorder, paraesthesia oral and his tongue was tingly. Concomitant medications included alprazolam taken for sleep disorder, simvastatin taken for lipids increased, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for sleep disorder.  The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Within two weeks  of that complete paralysis of left eye, blocking vision and making employment nearly impossible. Went to Dr. where blood work indicated his immune system was working overtime. When eye started drooping, within one week went to ER. No major cause. Best educated diagnosis ... Bell&#39;s Palsy, perhaps instigated by the exposure to virus in vaccine.

Had 2nd dose 05/19/21- exactly 3 weeks following first dose as specified and buzzing sound continues.  Both doses received at a local Walgreens.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

Pt received covid19 vaccine on 2/16/2019 while inpatient, right before his discharge on 2/17/2021.Of note, pt was put on hospice care at the time of discharge to patient&#39;s home. He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

The patient experienced not feeling good all over and was achy on 12Mar2021, neck ache going up to head on 12Mar2021, lips got very swollen on 12Mar2021, bottom of cheeks on his face swollen on 12Mar2021. Clinical course was provided as follows. The reporting consumer and her husband both received first dose of vaccine on 06Mar2021. Her husband did not feel good all over and was achy. His neck up to his head was also achy. His lips got very swollen and bottom cheeks of his face were also swollen. They were supposed to go for second shot on Saturday 27Mar2021. Swelling improved within 2 days. They did go through COVID test through this and both tested negative. At first they thought it was the virus. The patient has arthritis in his neck and thought it was a reaction from the vaccine because he was not having any issues before. She thought he was having a stroke. No ER or physician&#39;s office was required. On Saturday 13Mar2021, the patient went to his Primary Care physician. No other medical treatment other than taking Pepcid 20mg and Benadryl 25mg 2 tablets orally, both taken from 13Mar2021 to help with symptoms. The events were resolving at the time of report.

Tee revealed no cardiac source of embolism. He is left with some expressive and receptive aphasia. He also has some loss of L eye vision. There was no stenosis of the carotid arteries but the left M2 branch was occluded. He did not have any atrial fibrillation in the hospital but is wearing a 30 day monitor currently.   We have no idea this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report. The Neurologist thinks it is just a coincidence.  But we still want you to know it happened.

Then he started getting light headaches, and then his arms started jerking.  Then on Tuesday his feet went numb on both feet and he fell.  Now they keep going numb and okay and on and off.  It&#39;s like his nervous system and his motor skills have been affected.  He staggers now like he&#39;s drunk and had absolutely no symptoms or problems previously.   He is schedule d to see his PCP on 5/21/21.  Had an appointment for yesterday but had to cancel it.   He has taken some 81 mg aspirin but nothing else as he does not like to take any type of medicine.

                                                eye swelling; he had an allergy to the Covid 19; This is spontaneous report received from contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself.  A 72-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: BUD1230, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 17Feb2021 (age at vaccination was 72 years) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) and atenolol (ATENOLOL). The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL1284, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Jan2021 (age at vaccination was 72 years) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient has taken both doses. No additional vaccines were administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with any adverse event. In the original report caller stated that the patient reported he had an allergy to the Covid 19 vaccine 4 days after the first Covid 19 dose. He went to an allergist and the doctor asked him to wait 6 weeks until he took the second Covid 19 dose. After he received the second Covid 19 vaccine he had the same type of reaction as the first. The reaction was bumps on his scalp. Nothing major. He had taken Prednisone, Zyrtec at night, and Allegra in the morning. He recently has had bloodwork done and that bloodwork was sent to a lab. His concern was that lab results showed that he had a negative IGG serum so he doesn&#39;t have any Covid 19 antibodies. A culture was not performed. On an unspecified date, the patient also experienced eye swelling. The patient visited emergency room and physician office. The patient is a chemical engineer, not a biologist, but his theory is whether his immune system is keeping him from developing the antibodies. He doesn&#39;t know what to do now. He asked if he&#39;s protected. He asked if he should take a different type of Covid 19 vaccine that is not an mRNA vaccine. He was going to see his allergist again next Tuesday, 06Apr2021. He says there are people who developed the Covid 19 vaccine and he wants to call someone else and report his case. Someone who will pay attention to his case. None of the doctors that he visits have an answer about his allergy. He was taking the Prednisone after the first vaccine. He now takes Allegra in the morning and Zyrtec in the evening and that helps him. He also uses Cortisone10 cream where he has the bumps on his scalp. When he does that the number of bumps slowly disappear. No more swelling on the bumps. The bumps are on his scalp. He stopped using his shampoo and now uses baby shampoo. He reports after the first Covid 19 vaccine he didn&#39;t have a fever or felt tired, he didn&#39;t feel anything, just the bumps on his scalp appeared. He asked why he had no reaction right away after the first Covid 19 vaccine. He reported that it was 4-5 days after the first Covid 19 vaccine. He doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s the allergies or his immune system. After he stopped taking Prednisone, he continued to take the Allegra and Zyrtec and the bumps went away but then they appear in a different location. The bumps don&#39;t hurt or itch. In his original report he states he had enquired if he should get the second Covid 19 vaccine and he never received an answer. He continued to do everything he did before getting the Covid 19 vaccine. He still exercises, he bikes, he plays tennis. He&#39;s not tired or anything. When probing concomitant medications, he reported that his doctor recently changed his blood pressure medication from Losartan 25 mg to Amlodipine 2.5 mg. As a chemical engineer, and he&#39;s not a biologist, but he did the antibody test and he thought, what is his immune system doing. Whether his immune system is protecting him from the mRNA. He doesn&#39;t know. He would like someone who has the knowledge to answer his question. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I had a Diabetic Dr Appointmnet at 0800 on the 8th so In went to the appointment and informed Dr that I was partially blind in my right eye. She immediately had me hospitalized and the diagnosis of a stroke was confirmed by CAT Scan and x-ray and I think a MRI. I was discharged and returned 9 days later with worsening vision and balance. I had a severe fall on discharge and hit head kept me in a extra day and actually broke a rod on a low back fusion.

                                                On 03/23/2021 I had the second dose and I had a little bit of sore arm and a little bit lethargic for about 7-8 hours. On 05/04/2021 I woke up at 6:30 am and I felt just fine so I went back to sleep and woke up again at 8:30 and right away I knew something was wrong, I felt really weird. I could not hear, I lost hearing on my right ear for about 24 hours. I started to get vertigo and started to throw up and I vomited for about an hour. My wife decided to take me to the ER and they did an MRI and determined the stroke was in my cerebellum and that would explained the vertigo but that do not explained the hearing of loss. They gave me a blood thinner and diuretic. They thought is was Ménière&#39;s disease because of the hearing loss but after doing the MRI and CAT scan they determined it was a stroke. I was in the hospital for 3 days. I still have some balance problems and dizziness but I am getting better gradually.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

It is like cicada singing at both of your ears constantly, none stop, and annoying. It keeps happening since that day.  The strange thing is it will last for 2 days, then disappeared, then come back again one or one and half day.

                                                Purkinje Tree and Covid-19 Vaccine. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and massively increased vaccinations, there have been few ocular side effects reported with the  vaccine. 1) However conjunctivitis has occurred with Covid-19 infection and very rarely endophthalmitis has been reported.  I wish to mention an otherwise unreported association with visualization of a Purkinje Tree and Pfizer Covid-19 second vaccine. I am a 73 year old otherwise healthy retired male. I had an entoptic experience after I received my second vaccine.  With the first vaccine I had no visual side effects.  The afternoon of my second dose I took an hour long  nap, which was unusual for me.  When I woke up and opened my eyes I noticed a bilateral arborizing, interlacing dark pattern that lasted less than a second. This was opaque but without a ghost image and otherwise the wall, sheet,  and ceiling were seen clearly behind that network.   I experimented with opening and shutting either and both eyes looking at a white sheet beneath me, and found that especially with my dominant left eye I saw a pattern resembling my left eye retinal vascular tree.  The branches originated as single vessels  superiorly and inferiorly that branched down to smaller vessels  all on the right side of a disc type structure without duplication into an identifiable arteriolar and  venous system. Even with a light source moving over my left shoulder,  the image never lasted longer than a fraction of a second and fatigued quickly with repetition.  I laid back down and repeated the experiment of opening and shutting either eye while looking at a white ceiling. Then the image changed to a horizontally oriented pattern with two single black vessel type structures coming off a disc type structure.  The dark lines further branched and narrowed as they extended to the right and left off the disc type structure.  Again this lasted less than a second. It faded away rather than floated away. The image always appeared in the same area of my field of vision. It was peri-central when I looked at the wall and inferior to fixation when I looked at the ceiling.   The image would immediately move with eye movement, unlike a vitreous floater. Opening and shutting my left eye could refresh the image very briefly but that fatigued with repetition and could not be reproduced after 3-4 trials or without several hours between attempts. I did  translations of Purkinje?s description of the Tree (described here later.)  and had short term  partial success with his methods, except for pushing on  my eye, and using galvanic current,  which I did not attempt.  I declined a full exam but did  remember a lecture about Purkinje images.  He had the residents hold pen lights to the side of their eyes and move the light back and forth while he  described the Purkinje Tree. Afterwards he quizzed the residents about whether they could see it or not, with the ?humorous? disclaimer that it was a means of IQ testing if they could see it.  Half could.  It was of interest to me that  before I retired,  occasionally patients would mentions seeing the tree after an ophthalmoscopic exam.  I hoped to delight those patients by  telling them it was a form of IQ quiz and they had done well.  Two weeks later I was disappointed that I could no longer see the tree, but again declined an exam.  I am optically conversant, but physically adverse in seeking self care.   Purkinje first described the ?Tree?2) in his doctorate thesis in 1819. It was included in descriptions of other entoptic phenomena, performed mostly on himself. This was before the ophthalmoscope was discovered and before quality histological, serial sections were available.  He described holding a candle or using galvanic illumination in front of his eyes individually and moving it around.  He could see  black lines in a network that came off a central pit structure.  There were two lines inferiorly and superiorly with adjacent shadows and ultimately had size reducing branches.  He recognized these branching lines as retinal blood vessels, but could not discern any blood flow.  In 1825 he published a further volume 3) that dealt with experiments he subsequently had performed.  He found that by holding a sheet of paper with a hole in it that he moved around,  he could get a better view of the blood vessel pattern.  He could discern the macula and described anastomosing blood vessels superior to inferior.  A significant improvement in his discerning the blood vessel pattern was obtained with a safe amount of pressure on the superior lateral aspect of the eye.  With this he could recognized blood corpuscles and flow patterns and then labeled the lines as veins. He did not describe arteriole patterns.  So this leaves us with the question why this sudden awareness of the Purkinje Tree appeared in the time frame of a second Covid-19 vaccine.  This will require further reports to determine coincidence versus cause-effect.  This is a high stress time with Covid-19 deaths so prevalent. I had immediate relief after my second shot with a reduction of tension and increase in awareness of my general physical status as in the feeling of being hot or cold, sleepy or just fatigued, improved calmness, and the pertinent Purkinje Tree.  At sign in for the second series of Pfizer injections the RN on duty asked about side effects from the first shot.  She asked us to send a report in of any potential side effect then of the second shot and notified us that people were having more problems with the second shot than the first. Arm soreness, swelling, fever, chills, headache,  malaise, fatigue.  She gave us a print out list of known side effects, mostly systemic and all mild, but nothing ophthalmic.  With these things  in mind I was especially vigilant of any thing new in my general health or condition.  Most of the patients getting the shots were students and the congregating area was in a wing of a hospital.  This brought back the pleasant memory of my time in training and  my chief?s description of Purkinje?s Tree and perhaps enhanced the  brief ability to see the entoptic image.  In between times playing with this image my vision was normal and  my general health remained good, without symptoms of vascular compromise.

On 4/5/2021 paralysis  was still obvious and right eye was tearing.  Still no other issues.  On 4/6/2021 paralysis seems to interrupt chewing on right side.  Went to emergency thinking maybe it was a slight stroke.  Diagnosis was Bell palsy.

                                                My uncle died three days after taking the vaccine; he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat; he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting for her uncle.    A 73-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included psoriasis , cardiac pacemaker insertion on an unknown date (He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago) , hypertension from an unknown date.      The patient  died three days after taking the vaccine  on 09Apr2021 , he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 150/90   on  09Apr2021.    It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Course of the event: The reporter&#39;s uncle died three days after taking the vaccine. He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature. He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago and has a history of psoriasis and HTN. There is additional concomitant medical history I will have to confirm.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment for the reported patient&#39;s sudden death.

Worst for me was a serious deterioration of my eyesight (estimated 50% reduction) for 7 days and slight improvement to  about 25% eyesight reduction in the second week, gradually improving to near normal in the third week after the first dose. At this point I&#39;ll mention that after the second dose, I had almost no adverse reactions, except for, again, an eyesight difficulty, a lesser reduction (about 25%) in my eyesight for four days, improving to normal after about a week.

It was him that wasn&#39;t solid; Headache; This is a spontaneous case received from a contactable consumer reported behalf of her husband. A 73 years old patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (lot/Batch: EN6206) on 13Mar2021 at single dose on left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was High blood pressure (Treatment of high blood pressure: &#34;Lisinopril dose one a day and dose is 12.5 according to it, it says here is HCTZ 10-12.5 mg it&#39;s oral tablet takes one at breakfast time); And then something else he takes because we had a storm earlier in summer, he was working where he works and wind just blew him face down into concrete side wall, but he put his arm up to resist it off, so he has been back and forth with his neurologist on this.&#34; There is another one that he does take because of hitting the side walk when I told him the wind blew him the side walk, he put his arm up but he gets a little dizzy once in a while because of that. It&#39;s Meclizine 25 mg, tablet, afternoon and evening 2 times a day.&#34; Concomitant drugs included Lisinopril, HCTZ and Meclizine. This past three weeks ago, &#39;my husband and I&#39; (not clear) had our first injection for the Pfizer and within 4 minutes he was showing all kinds of reaction to it and he know he does not have reactions to very much of anything. I have no idea like it was something within the Pfizer medication that he was allergic to, allergic reaction. He stood on the floor I didn&#39;t figure out why he was standing up, he said the floor doesn&#39;t look steady to me which meant he was a little weak or dizzy whatever I don&#39;t know, so I reached over and I looked at his forehead and I said his forehead was dripping and I touched his forehead and it was cold, so the cold sweat coming from the forehead.&#34; He was excessively tired for almost 2 weeks. Like I said he kept on standing up the couple of times and I said what&#39;s the matter and he said I don&#39;t feel like I am standing on a solid ground and I said yes you are, then he told me a few days later that his feet bothered him after that shot, he couldn&#39;t really describe what it was, but he told me it went right down to his feet and that&#39;s probably why he didn&#39;t feel right. So, anyway I end up calling over an RN and she and another RN had to take him over to take his blood pressure, his blood pressure went down and now only he had high blood pressure, he took his medication (Unspecified Medication) that morning like he always does and it went down to 107/70 and when they gave him a small bottle of water to drink and they said just stand up and take it. Took the medication stood up and it was 132/80, it was probably more than his normal. So, I mean I couldn&#39;t understand what was happening that he was tired through, excessive tired to the point that he didn&#39;t want to go to work, so I mean I didn&#39;t question what&#39;s wrong specially when I looked over and his forehead just dripping, for approximate 4 minutes after the injection. So, I mean I really don&#39;t know to have been that way. Then often had, he told me he had &#39;more&#39; (not clear) saliva for a week and a half, it&#39;s just saliva in his mouth that kept on foaming up. I had noted to if this was anything that was never him, he has never had lot of saliva in his mouth anyway. But, this side of him of course it showed it was working and that lasted almost 2 weeks as well, 2 week I think 2 weeks. And now he is starting to feel better but he didn&#39;t feel well but better than 2 weeks after the first injection. I had taken that was on 13th, 13th took him to his doctor and he recommended to not take a second one. He felt very weak, I mean this took 2 weeks to go away. He did mention that when he stood up he didn&#39;t feel like he was standing on solid ground and I know this as I have been there probably for more than 50 years, so of course he was. He received them, his blood pressure dropped to a 107/70 went that down, changing back to 132/80, actually they gave him a bottle of water in between and he did drink water for it so. And his forehead was dripping cold sweat and he told me later that he felt something strange in feet and that&#39;s why he was standing up I couldn&#39;t figure that part out in fact he was on solid floor or solid ground, so I am thinking the weakness set in him very quickly. So, that he was really dizzy, I don&#39;t know and that&#39;s why I said I called over the RN and she grabbed another RN and they helped him over to take his blood pressure they took it down it was almost 107/70. Now if he has got high blood pressure, it just the blood pressure going to be really in morning and this is at 5:30 at night, doesn&#39;t mean like and he is a lot to me. And he had excess saliva in his mouth seem to be foaming in his mouth. I don&#39;t know if you had any of these reactions or unless it&#39;s just him I really don&#39;t know. When probed for the start date of the events (event not specified), reporter stated, &#34;Approximate 5:39, maybe 5:39, 5:40 in the evening which was last month, that on the 13th.&#34; Reporter confirmed that patient would not go for second dose of vaccine and that reporter is due for second dose on this Saturday. And according to what I understand and what I was told 107/70 wasn&#39;t trending down, to me it was, but I am not a doctor nor a nurse or any other professional to have said not in medical field but when his forehead started dripping cold sweat and he was acting little strange and standing up and what is wrong because I was right next to him, I said what is wrong, he said I feel like I am falling down. The biggest one that bothers him beside being also retired for 2 weeks. He keeps on getting this foam in his mouth from saliva, excess saliva foam and that has no idea what&#39;s close to. High blood pressure, he had taken that tablet (Unspecified Medication) that morning. Actually the tiredness is gone away, the blood pressure is back to normal, like I said he was absolutely tired for 2 weeks and I think it coincide with Pfizer&#39;s 1 to 2 days. He is also having a headache and he just take Tylenol for that. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow up attempts needed. Information about lot/ batch number not requested.

                                                Spinal meningitis; Shingles; severe pounding headaches; migraine; pain in his back; wobbly, very off balance; dizziness; stomach pain; stomach felt hard; has not had a correct bowel movement since then; ringing in his ears; hearing loss; drive his blood pressure up/his blood pressure goes up; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (patient and wife). A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

The patient experienced sudden hearing loss on 08Apr2021 17:00 with outcome of unknown. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient did not received any treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was unknown. Not covid-19 tested post vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 vaccination; adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1132646) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose, subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1136949) to Mar2021, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient medical history includes ear infection. Concomitant medications were not reported. On unknown dates, the patient experienced tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles and whole left side of face and eye swollen. In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Also I now have a constant ringing in my head. sounds like a TV was left on after the broadcasting stopped.

Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

Yesterday, February 2nd, in  the late afternoon I became very red and itchy and my tongue swelled. I went to  the emergency room where they gave me sodium chloride, Benadryl,  Pepcid and 2 &#34;epi&#34; shots. After about 4 hours I was sent home. Could that have  been a reaction to my Covid vaccine? Today I am tired but fine and swelling is  gone. I had told the person who scheduled my first shot and the person who  vaccinated me that I was taking Skyrizi injections for psoriasis and had my  last injection of Skyrizi on Dec 15.&#34;

                                                I received the two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. I was given the second dose (2/3/21) three weeks after the first dose (1/13/21). Some time after receiving the first dose, I noticed a subtle but definite strange feeling all around my mouth and tongue, like a &#34;film&#34; over everything. I also noticed a loss of taste. I suffered from anosmia and dysgeusia many years ago, but through medical intervention, I gained back over 90% of smell and 80% of taste. Now I&#39;ve noticed more loss of taste again, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence that it&#39;s happened while getting vaccinated. I just hope that I regain taste (which is only 45-50% now maybe) as time goes by.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right upper arm on 04Mar2021 at 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6199) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at the military facility. He previously received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number: EN9581) on 11Feb2021 at 2-3 pm (at the age of 74 years old) in the right upper arm and experienced a bout of diarrhea, but he took loperamide (IMODIUM) and it went away; he expected the first shot and last only about a day. Relevant medical history included ongoing legally blind, wherein his central vision was screwed up and this was something going on before the shots and with his peripheral vision, there were areas he could see clearly, and also had eye pain; his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, which was ongoing; and residual neuropathy in feet; all from an unknown date prior the vaccine. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient previously took clonazepam (KLONOPIN) from an unspecified date in 2009; further reported that the patient had no information on this medication other than it was Klonopin that caused him to stop breathing and put in coma in 2009 and that he was given intravenous (IV) antibiotics, because he had 3 major infections and this was when the issue with his vision started. The patient previously received and stopped getting the flu shot years prior reporting when he got sick for 6 weeks. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) other than the first dose. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). The patient reported that he got the second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and within 5 minutes, he had a severe reaction. He was in an observation area at the facility and less than 5 minutes after getting the shot, he had problems breathing on 04Mar2021, it was painful to breath; however, it was further reported that &#34;painful&#34; was not the word for the problems breathing. The triage team gave him shots and he went to the emergency room (ER) and ended up spending the night in the hospital. It was further reported that they gave him an epinephrine (EpiPen) and some other shot in the left arm and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) in the right arm and put on oxygen on him. He was admitted to the hospital and released the next day. He was given the option to leave the next day and so he did. The doctor explained, they were concerned it was cardiac related, but did blood work and told them he was fine on an unspecified date in 2021. The doctor also told him they saw a rash on the left ankle on 04Mar2021 and therefore knew it was an allergic reaction. The rash on ankle was barely visible the next day, it had resolved though, but was not sure of the exact date. He couldn&#39;t have seen it anyway. There had also been other issues since then. He remarked that he moved things, but couldn&#39;t remember where he moved them on an unspecified date in 2021. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened. Regarding the patient&#39;s hearing, he explained that while in church, they were playing music and it was pure pain. He went to the clinic and saw an otolaryngologist, who told him that his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, not all though. He stated he had this before, but never with music at the church or like this. He was in the car and a car beside him with heavy base playing was giving him issues; the same kind of the pain, but on the opposite end with base. This was something new and not like he had before. It was ongoing and he had not gone back to church, so as not to experience this again. This started within a week or 2 after the second shot. Since the shots on an unspecified date in Mar2021, his vision was compromised. There were upper and lower areas, &#34;sweet spots,&#34; he could see. With his last check up, the vision in the lower section had shrunk even more; where he could see from about the 3:30 to 8:30 area before, currently it was from 5:00 to 7:00. He explained this was like on a clock. Also he was able to see the big E at the top of a vision chart, but in Mar2021 after the second shot, he noticed within days, he could no longer see the large E. He had a regularly schedule appointment a couple weeks after the second shot and this was noticed. It had gotten worse. Additionally, he would stand in front of the eye chart and as part of the eye exam, they would hold out fingers to see if he could see them. Last year at 6 feet (ft), he could see them, but currently, he couldn&#39;t see them until 2 ft away. If he was in bright light, he had severe eye pain, to the point of crying. He had to leave and get out of that situation, it was so bad. Even going outside with a hat and sunglass without looking at bright light, it still impacted him. The lighting in his bathroom bothered him; he had to have the blinds closed and was home bound. His closet was the only way to get relief. This was all new since the Covid shot. On an unspecified date in 2021, the residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened. He had this previously, but currently had hypersensitive in his feet in those areas. The patient found some essential oils that help so he could get to sleep and keep it from itching in his feet. The patient was deducting that for whatever reason, it was impacting nerve areas that had issues previously. It was causing them to get worse. He could only find this commonality; the optic, auditory, and residual neuropathy, the shot was aggravating these things that he already had problems with previously. It was added that he had also noticed his eyes had a throbbing pain, like a feeling of wanting to explode. He has had this in the past, but not too often and currently, it was daily and it was getting worse. It started about 3 weeks after, but it didn&#39;t happen often at first. Currently, it was almost daily. The doctor told him that there was not a way this could happen, there was no evidence this could happen. There had been no treatment, nothing had been done. He said with his DNA, if something could go wrong even just 1% then it would happen to him. The AE &#34;problems breathing&#34; did require an ER visit. The patient was hospitalized for the event problems breathing from 04Mar2021 to 05Mar2021. The patient underwent further lab tests and procedures, which included hearing test with unknown results on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of problems breathing, allergic reaction, and rash on the left ankle. The patient recovered from the event &#34;problems breathing&#34; on 04Mar2021; he recovered from the events &#34;allergic reaction and rash on the left ankle&#34; on an unspecified date in 2021; he was not recovered from the events &#34;residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened, hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened, and his vision since the shots was compromised/vision in the lower section had shrunk even more/gotten worse,&#34; while the outcome of the other event was unknown.

He couldn&#39;t even go outside.; After he got vaccine, his seasonal allergies were acting up; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program COVAX US Support. A 74-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04May2021 as 2nd dose single for COVID-19 immunization. Historical vaccine of BNT162B2 was given as a first dose 3 weeks before the 2nd dose. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergy from an unspecified date. Patient has seasonal allergies and he was advised by his doctor to wait for 3 months before taking Depo-Medrol/corticosteroids. He got swollen eyes and serious allergies because he cannot take any steroid shots - Asking for medication to take for treatment of his allergies - Patient is very frustrated and provided limited information only, he does not want to make any safety report  Potential Duplicate AE Report E transmit. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Individuals who receive treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids, for cancer or an autoimmune disease, or planned receipt throughout the study. If systemic corticosteroids have been administered short term (&lt;14 days) for treatment of an acute illness, participants should not be enrolled into the study until corticosteroid therapy has been discontinued for at least 28 days before study intervention administration. Inhaled/nebulized (except for participants in Phase 1 see exclusion criterion 14), intra-articular, intra bursal, or topical (skin or eyes) corticosteroids are permitted. On an unspecified date patient experienced his eyes were swollen, he couldn&#39;t even go outside and after he got vaccine, his seasonal allergies were acting up. After he got vaccine, his seasonal allergies were acting up. He went to his doctor to get Depo-Medrol. They did not administer Depo-Medrol due to COVID vaccine. He was told he needed to wait 3 months. His eyes were swollen. He couldn&#39;t even go outside. Caller wants to know if there is anything else he can take. Caller said he usually gets his allergy shot in April or May. It was delayed since he got the COVID shot. After that cleared up, he was able to get his first shot, and after that cleared up, he was able to get his second shot. After that he went to the doctor, who was not aware, and because it&#39;s a steroid, he couldn&#39;t do it. He could not get Depo-Medrol because it was a steroid. Also stated that his allergies were so bad that he wanted to rip his eyes out of his head. The outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient experienced seizure on 20Apr2021 with outcome of recovered in 2021, lost vision in left eye on 20Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 21Apr2021, unable to use left arm or hand on 20Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 21Apr2021. The events caused Emergency Room Visit, and were serious due to hospitalization since 20Apr2021 to May2021 for 19 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging and scan brain: no evidence of a stroke said it was a seizure on 20Apr2021. The consumer reported that her husband ended up going to the ER and spending 2.5 weeks in hospital after the second dose. She says it started out like a stroke, he lost vision in his left eye temporarily then couldn&#39;t use his left arm, couldn&#39;t raise it or use his hand or wiggle his fingers. She says that ended up being temporary too. She says he then took a seizure before the ambulance got there, so when he got to the hospital they assumed it was stroke and a seizure and he ended up in intensive care unit. She says as days went on and they did MRIs and brain scans, stuff like that, they found no evidence of a stroke said it was a seizure that caused it, and that next day he got his vison back after he was there overnight in the intensive care unit, and could use his arm, raise his arm, and hold things with his left hand. She says it was 20Apr, 20 days later, that this occurred and he was admitted to the hospital. The patient was home now after spending 2.5 weeks in the hospital. She says he is home and doing ok, he is back to how he was. She says that they did give him a seizure medicine.

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.  He had some pain in the arms particularly at the injection site initially but that has resolved.  He had dry mouth up until February 2nd.  By February 2nd he could start to transfer a bit better from a chair to his driver seat in the van.  He is still not back to his baseline function.

About 10 minutes after leaving I had sensation of a metallic taste in mouth and tongue, primarily on rt side. I was concerned that the tongue might be swollen. My wife who is a retired nurse looked at it and didn&#39;t see anything to be concerned about. All the symptoms were gone within two hours.

The same thing happend after the first dose, given at the same Walgreens Drugstore, on April 22, 2021.  Pfizer ER8732.  The first event lasted for several days, then gradually abated.  This time (2nd dose) the metallic/bitter taste seems to be a little more prominent, and the taste continues into this, the second day after vaccine was given.  The taste of foods and liquids are only slightly altered, and some not at all. I&#39;ve read this occurs, but it is very rare.  Just reporting for your statistical records.
