                                                One week of the vaccine, while having some coffee and cookies. About tens of consuming them, I felt like I was getting a cold and had to keep clearing my throat.  I told my wife I feel wired and she mentioned my right eye looked different.  In about two more minutes my right was swollen closed and speaking became difficult due to the swelling.  My wife drove me to Hospital and I received Epinephrine and Benadryl and fluids.

The next day Thursday I had a visual deficite in my eye along with the floaters.  By Friday evening I went up to see the eye doctor while at work and was advised I had 5 tears to the retina of my right eye and was advised it needs to be repaired immediately. On 1/9 I had a vitrectomy and the tears in the retina were repaired as well.  I was advised the surgery had an 85% success rate but advised I will develop a cataract in the eye within 6months but within 6 weeks it developed. 2/22 I had the cataract removed  and a lense replaced in my right eye.

                                                Tinnitus has been going on in top section of my head since about 3 hours after the vaccine.  I believe I have a compromised blood brain barrier due to the fact that I had taken prescribed anti inflammatory for 15 years for my lower back pain. So now if I take anything with anti inflammatory effects I get tinnitus but it goes away soon afterward, depending on strength of dose.  It has been 4 days now with no sign of relief. I am eating a low salicylate diet right now to help my body process any anti inflammatory.

                                                I received my vaccine on a Tuesday morning, and five days later on Sunday morning I woke up with very swollen checks--my head looked like a pumpkin.  When my girlfriend saw me in the afternoon, she said, &#34;I&#39;m taking you to the emergency room!&#34;  But, I told her that I had no fever and no other symptoms, so we should wait.  The swelling was bad enough that my jaws ached and my cheeks felt like they were going to burst, but if I didn&#39;t chew any food, the swelling would subside slightly, and my jaws would stop aching.   I read online that people with botox who get the vaccine can have facial swelling and a 24 hour course of benadryl will knock down the swelling.  I have never had botox injections, but I took some benadryl for two days, which made me feel really tired.  I ate only soup and yogurt, so that I didn&#39;t have to chew any food.   I don&#39;t know if the benadryl had any effect, but over about 5 days, the swelling subsided, then I could eat again without causing my jaws to swell up.

The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported)\ via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental issues since 1988. The patient stated &#34;I am calling about an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer shot. If you guys have anybody called in and find out if anybody is having the same. After the second shot, about a day after the shot, it was terrible. I got the shot last Tuesday and I feel like I am on drugs like I on &#39;some acid&#39; (not clarified). But I am not hallucinating, I am not seeing things, I am not hearing things, I just physically feel that way. Everything is kind of blurry, my vision is blurry and it&#39;s kind of hard to concentrate on television and stuff like that. It seems like some people are playing mind games with it but I don&#39;t think they have (further clarification unknown, hence not captured as event). I don&#39;t know if I hallucinated that or not (consumer was not sure). That&#39;s pretty much here I feel like I am on drugs constantly and it is just kind of scary. I have mental issues since 1988, I take psych meds but it seems whenever I take my psych meds (unspecified medications) I feel worst for couple of hours.&#34; Outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 60-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 (Lot Number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported) as single dose; and dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 (lot Number: EL8982, expiry date not reported) as single dose; for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eye surgery (he already had surgery once) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 then on 29Jan2021 the 2nd dose. He experienced side effects: floaters on 06Jan2021, and streaks of lightening then vision loss on 15Mar2021. There was a large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left and a detached retina on the left and a tear on the right retina on 19Mar2021. He already had surgery once. He will have 2nd surgery on the other eye. Reporter reported a follow up.  He can&#39;t see at all. He was recovering and has to lay on face for 2 weeks. Reporter stated she read about retina problems related to the virus but not to the vaccine, could not find information. Patient was a retail pharmacist. He deals with customers and several customers stated they had vision problems with the vaccine: double vision, loss of sight. &#34;There was a problem out there, but maybe they were not reporting it took reporter 2 hours to report so they may not have the time to sit there to report&#34;. Reporter knew they can&#39;t prove it was the vaccine that caused it. Reporter don&#39;t believe in coincidences. It seemed quite obvious to them it&#39;s related to the vaccine. Reporter appreciated all the help and stated they didn&#39;t have all the answers.  Reporter sure it was the vaccine because it was within hours after the first vaccine, but since there was no information regarding the sight problems related to the vaccine patient didn&#39;t think about it. Then the floaters got worse and started to block his vision, after the 2nd vaccine it was dramatically; within hours it was worse. He&#39;s never been sick in 36 years (2021). Patient hoped no one else has to deal with what he has to deal with. Patient also reported that on 10Feb2021, patient had section of vision lost in the left eye. It was then reported that patient was well versed in the virus and the vaccine. He was unable to speak on the phone at this time as he was recovering from surgery. Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 6Jan2021 and right away began seeing hundreds of floaters. He didn&#39;t correlate it to the vaccine but it didn&#39;t go away. Then he received the second dose of the vaccine on 29Jan2021 and within hours he thought he was going blind. He went to an optometrist 01Feb2021 who sloughed off the idea of it being related to the vaccine and diagnosed him with Posterior Vitreous Detachment. It was previously reported to Pfizer when he got the diagnosis of the PVD and all the events mentioned were previously reported. Reporter stated that from that day on the floaters got larger; the around 15Mar2021 he noticed every time he bent over he saw streaks of lightning; and he started to have a black hole, a loss of about 20% of his field of vision in the left eye. He went to another local optometrist 19Mar2021, who saw a large horseshoe tear in on left retina; and a detached left retina. The local optometrist sent him to a specialist and who verified the tear and the detachment and said the other retina in the right eye also has a small tear. Patient then had eye surgery, Monday at 0700AM, 22Mar2021 by outpatient surgery, to drain the fluid in his eye; insert a gas bubble and a silicone band to repair the retina; and did laser surgery on the tear. The specialist advised that the surgery damages the lens so he will need the lens replaced in the future. Now her patient has to lay down with his face down for 23 hours a day for two weeks and take 6-8 weeks off work. He had a doctor&#39;s visit yesterday and the doctor seemed satisfied with his progress but he can&#39;t see out of the eye, everything was cloudy so he doesn&#39;t know if the floaters are gone or the eye sight is recovered yet. The doctor was planning to do the right eye tear repair on Thursday 25Mar2021. Reporter had searched online to see if other people have this, but she can&#39;t seem to get the stories online about problems with the retina and the vaccine. She wanted this to be known and documented. Reporter was asking if company have information about if other people have had this. As per reporter, the events were not serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events reported. The patient required physician&#39;s office visit for the events reported. The patient had not recovered from section of vision lost in the left eye, large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left/tear on the right retina/small tear right eye, detached retina on the left, and floaters. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 61-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 03Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

I probably got it 16 days ago on Wednesday, the date I got it, I received it on Wednesday 03Mar2021 of this year. It was the Wednesday, this Saturday I was feeling great, feeling fine and I became, I lost my hearing on my right ear, my right ear at the same side as the shot and I still have tinnitus then I have taken steroids (prednisone) for it (treatment). Four days later, I experienced low hearing in my right ear, low hearing, I lost my hearing in my right ear. I have tinnitus, still I have ringing in my (right) ear. Yes, I want them to follow up because I don&#39;t know if I should take the 2nd shot. I am not sure if I am going to take the 2nd shot because I will just the &#34;affect&#34; (not clarified), I don&#39;t want to get deaf. I got, my hearing, my hearing is back. I don&#39;t know what extend, I am going to the doctor next week to get a hearing test. I have been taking prednisone, a steroid for my hearing; 10 mg tablet, I started off of it&#39;s 6 tablets 3 times a day and decreased to 5 tablets 3 times a day, 60 mg for 3 days in a row then 50 mg for 3 days in a row and then 40 mg for 3 days in a row, I got a table at time, so I was getting a bad reaction to the prednisone, So my doctor told me to stop it. (Dosage further not clarified) I was getting super anxiety, I couldn&#39;t, I can&#39;t sleep at night and can&#39;t sleep at all. I am on antibiotics and steroid (treatment), I am on steroid to regain my hearing and now next weekend I am supposed to do for my second shot and I don&#39;t to take it but I &#34;still&#34; (not clarified) have tinnitus and I lost my hearing in my right ear, I don&#39;t know what to do, so I just waited at home let&#39;s see what happened this. Are those side adverse effects or what, I don&#39;t know?&#34; Outcome of lost hearing was recovered and of tinnitus was not recovered.

Soft high-frequency crickets when my throat gets stressed, including hiccups, burping, stretching, sometimes yawning, muscle tensing, sometimes swallowing, stretching to wake up in the morning.  Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

                                                March 26, 2021: One week to the day after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine, my right eye suddenly had double vision and facial pain behind the right eye and all around the right eye (forehead, right temple, around to under the right eye on the cheek).  The right eye would not move correctly.    March 27, 2021: I went to see Optometrist.  He performed an eye exam with dilation and stated that the right eye was slow to track, and that the nerve behind the right eye was inflamed.  He recommended blood work, CT scan, and an MRI.    March 27, 2021 ? March 28, 2021: We went to ER at 9:00pm.  After waiting six hours, I finally was able to see an ER doctor.  No medical history was taken.  No bloodwork was done.  ER Dr performed a CT scan as Dr requested.  CT scan w/o contrast showed no masses or hemorrhages.  ER suggested to follow-up with Nuerology.  March 29, 2021: Went to Neurologist and he examined me.  He called in another Dr for a second opinion.  They stated that it may be a possible cranial nerve palsy and ordered multiple MRIs.    March 29, 2021: The earliest MRI appointment available was April 7, 2021.  Scheduled the MRI.  April 1, 2021: Had blood drawn at lab as Dr requested.  April 2, 2021: Two weeks from the day of COVID19 vaccine #2, my right eyelid would not open at all and the pain was getting worse.  April 5, 2021: Went to ER at 4:30am.  Triage nurse sent me straight to an ER room and within minutes an ER doctor was there.  Within 15 minutes after seeing the ER doctor, a Neurologist was examining me.  The nuero doctor was very thorough.  While waiting for the MRI, other neurologists and residents also examined me.  MRI scans with and without contrast were performed.  MRI images were clear ? no tumors, no aneurisms, and no stroke.  They concluded that it was a micro-vascular injury to cranial nerve #3.  (Similar to the Bells Palsy that I had in 2015.)  They prescribed gabapentin to help calm the nerve pain.  Follow-up will be with nuero-ophthalmologist.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right upper arm on 27Apr2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EWO171; Expiration Date: Aug2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history including hearing was about 80 percent in the left ear/loss of 20-30 percent which started 10 years ago when the patient was 51. The patient has no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. After receiving a dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 27Apr2021, the patient experienced hearing loss in his left ear, it was barely noticeable but today (04May2021 12:00) there was a dramatic shift and he experienced hearing loss on both ears, it was instantaneous. The patient wanted to know if there are any reports of hearing loss and when could it go away. He has a hearing issue in his left ear that he has had, his hearing was about 80 percent in the left ear and in the right ear it was a 100 percent. Today, at noon he has almost lost his hearing in his left ear and his right ear seems like there is water in there or it is underwater. His left ear sounds like everything is echoing but, he can hear the call handler just fine. His right ear was perfect and now it is messed up. He is worried about that. The patient wonders why that happened and why did they both go. He reported that the shot may have had something to do with it and if it does, what should he do or maybe he is just getting old. He cannot hear in the left ear much; he was just testing it while on hold listening to the music to see how much he had. He felt like there is water in it, not a little, a lot of water and it echoes a little bit and seemed like it&#39;s underwater. Started 10 years ago when he was 51, he lost 20-30 percent and it stopped as far as he could tell. He did not get checked out then because he could hear clearly. Today at 12 pm, and it was not gradual, it was like turning a light on, immediately things were muffled. Even when he was putting his hands over his ears, there was like an echo. He was on the phone with his wife at the time. He did not know what happened, so, he went to work, and nothing is changed. He told her something just happened to his ears. He thought of doing something in the meantime and not trying to wait for it to get better. Right ear feels like it is underwater, maybe the left ear is affecting the right the or the weaker ear is being affected more. The right ear is the stronger ear over the left ear. That is what bothering him. His weaker ear is being affected more than his good ear, which his right ear has always been the stronger ear and he never had problems before with his right ear. It was a dramatic switch today at 12pm and his ears have been that way ever since. The left ear feels like its underwater, so much even if he blocks that ear with his finger or his palm. Still there is something going on in both ears. He did not notice the right ear because the other ear was such a shock and he was just dealing with that. He noticed the right side too after trying to see if he could hear out of the left. He had no baseline to go off of for sure or a history. No baseline to go from other than this hearing change of event, which may be totally him. He wanted to see if there is anything related to this because it was so dramatic. The events were not treated. The outcome of the event &#34;experienced hearing loss in his left ear/hearing loss on both ears&#34; was not recovered while the other events were unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

I have experienced a much lesser degree of tinnitus in the past, always a momentary transient event, not nearly as loud as I am currently experiencing.

About 3am in the morning, I woke up like someone hit me in the head with a hammer. After that every second or third day the pain would come back and it would be worse, it brought tears to my eyes. I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I&#39;m not having them as much. I&#39;m calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

He let me know he could not focus enough to read and retain anything.  He wanted to talk but couldn&#39;t find the words.  He remained very quiet but had no other symptoms of fever, pain, or anything else.  10 days post vaccine and he is doing better but still not feeling normal and not talking and holding conversations as usual.  He is able to answer appropriately .  The last two days he said all food is tasting bland without a lot of flavor.  He has taken a couple Tylenol  the last two days and drank Echinacea tea to try and make an improvement.  Is there data or information to give us any idea how long this could last?

Using an online frequency generator I have observed the frequency tone around 7,000hz. Always the same tone, same intensity. On a scale of 1-10 the intensity (loudness) around 7. I hear this tone from the time I wake up till I fall asleep, every second, everyday. This has never happened to me before in my life.

                                                Did not connect adverse event to the vaccination until roughly three days after it was recognized. Had first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 on Friday, January 29, 2021. On the following Sunday or Monday (2 or 3 days post vaccination), I noticed ringing in my ears. I have always had perfect hearing, no issues whatsoever. I knew nothing about tinnitus, so just figured it would go away. Days later, it hadn&#39;t gone away so did some research and wondered if it could be associated with the vaccine. Searched the web, but found nothing. Considered calling a hearing specialist (long story so will keep it short), but all info found said there was little that could be done, so did not make the call.  Since couldn&#39;t find relation to vaccine, received second dose on February 19, 2021 without any other issues. Tinnitus continues as originally noticed. Finally yesterday, I related the Covid vaccine to tinnitus after reading an article on J&amp;J&#39;s vaccine candidate that stated tinnitus had been seen as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials.

Still ringing loudly two days before  appointment to get second dose of Pfizer with some occasional right ear ringing also (which I never had before at any volume). So felt I had to cancel the second dose. Now going on 26 days of constant life changing tinnitus. Obviously hoping it subsides.

But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

                                                I received my first Pfizer vaccine on 3/9. This past Thursday, 3/18/21,  I woke up with increased tinnitus (I?ve always had some) and hearing reduction in my right ear. It reminded me of a middle ear infection I had in my youth but this one had resulted in no pain, fever, or dizziness. I do not have a cold or any infectious respiratory issues. I found that it did resolve somewhat if I?d move to a higher elevation and as the day progressed. My left ear would have short spells that would eventually resolve. This continued through Sunday evening when my right ear cleared and I noticed a foul taste in my mouth. Today it?s resumed somewhat, not to the level it was at before, with a little congestion in my left ear...it &#34;crackles&#34; a little when I swallow, but often will clear if I yawn or cough.  I did a little research about the Pfizer vaccine and this situation is listed as a possible side effect that is supposed to be reported, so I am doing so.

This phenomena started again late in the day on the day after the injection although its intensity was less. Now, exactly two days later, I am not hearing this.

It was reported the patient experienced hypoacusis and has a new hearing aid on an unspecified date. Caller says her husband has new hearing aids, which is why he is not doing the report himself.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: results unavailable on an unspecified date , &#39;they did a couple tests&#39; (details not provided)  results unavailable on 02Apr2021, urine analysis: results unavailable on an unspecified date.

Since he hit his head she called an ambulance, and they took him to PRIVACY in PRIVACY. They  did a couple tests and said since it was so soon after getting the vaccine that they did not think the vaccine had to do with his blood clots. Caller also stated he fainted because that was one of the side effects of the vaccine, but they were glad he got there since he had several blood clots in his lungs. On the same day (02Apr2021) he had a thrombectomy to remove the blood clots and put him on a blood thinner. Patient was admitted to the hospital April 2nd and was discharged April 4th. He  is doing better, he is on a blood thinner now. She says there were a few doctors that had to weigh in on whether he should get the second dose, they decided it wouldn&#39;t affect it since the vaccine goes into his muscle.  No  other vaccinations on the same days as his Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinations or during the four weeks prior.  Once they placed him on a blood thinner, they took him off Colchicine 0.6mg.  He stopped taking Colchicine because they said the blood thinner doesn&#39;t work with that particular medication.  It was also reported The patient is to schedule an appointment with a  rheumatologist and a hematologist, they did blood work and a urine test and said he has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                101 fever for 5 days straight. Still get a fever every afternoon/evening but about 99. Extreme fatigue for first 10 days. As soon as eat breakfast have to go back to bed for 1-3 hours. Same with lunch, eat, go back to bed about 3 hours and same with dinner. Then go to bed for evening. Extreme brain fog and forgetfulness. Can&#39;t think of words or make sentences. Can&#39;t remember anything. Feels like a very heavy feeling in head like head weighs a lot and very cloudy. Pain from shot in arm moved up to neck, ear and jaw the day after shot. Arm quit hurting but couldn&#39;t lift it. Pain stayed in neck, ear and jaw for a week and now is a stiff feeling. I think the lymph nodes are swollen. Effects eating, hard to keep food down. Nausea and stomach pain. I have appetite but have to eat while nauseous and pain. Still severely fatigued every day and have to sleep most of each day or at least sit and rest. So exhausted. Also night of shot started getting hot and cold chills. Still have them over 2 weeks after shot. Bad tinnitus started night of shot and still have it over 2 weeks after shot. Very loud and nothing makes it go away. Bad headache started morning after shot. I have had a headache pretty much everyday, all day since the shot over 2 weeks ago. I feel sick like I have flu.

Ear and Face were swollen, warm to touch, painful and could not hear.  I am still having difficulty hearing in that ear (3-25-2021), sounds like liquid in that ear.  I called a tele doc service on Sunday, 02/14/2021, they prescribed Amoxicillin -Clav.  Temperature and swelling went away, still having difficulty hearing in that ear.

I wasn&#39;t aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus. It is now on the verge of being debilitating in nature. It is now  pulsating and much louder, very difficult to ignore even during day time activities. Before my tinnitus was bilaterally equal, now I would say my right ear is louder than my left. But both are louder than before. Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.

It really got annoyingly noticeable in both ears after shot two.  I would consider the after  effects of each dose to be normal...dose 1 felt a little lousy the next day with headache and fatigue but ok after that, dose 2 felt lousy the next day with low grade fever about 100.5.  Felt fine the next day.  Except for the tinnitus.

The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included Chronic tinnitus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Patient had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms, Before the vaccines). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, also not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and no any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 first dose on 18Jan2021 (lot number: EK4176) on 18Jan2021 in left arm for covid-19 immunization. It was reported by the patient that: &#34;previous to the vaccines I had chronic tinnitus with mild symptoms. I am a retired dentist. I was not aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus (on 21Feb2021).

Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.&#34; The outcome of the event was not recovered. The case was considered as serious (criteria-Disabling/Incapacitating: Yes). No treatment was received for the adverse event.   Additional information has been requested.

I was monitored a full 30 minutes and then released after reporting I felt ok then.

                                                I have chronic Lyme disease, with extreme symptoms of photosensitivity and photophobia.  12 years ago, I had a series of intravenous antibiotics for 9 months.  That halted the progression of the symptoms.  However, with the first injection of the Pfizer vaccine, I had an immediate and increasing photosensitivity/photophobia.  For example, my computer monitor was at 6% brightness.  I reset to 3% brightness, which is still too bright.  My concern is that the second injection due on February 12th may further increase the symptoms.  My Lyme doctor believes that the light sensitivity is perhaps coming from the thalamus.  Additionally, the injection seemed to increase my INR.

                                                According to staff....Recipient received the above vaccination and went to sit for 30 minutes.  He had already explained to the staff that he had had previous reactions to bee stings that required epinephrine so the nurse practitioner had  instructed him that he was to wait for 30 minutes vs the usual 15 minutes.  It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

A 66-year-old male received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that he was having some symptoms that has got worse and wanted to know if he should do something and wanted to know something what went with his eyes. His right eye was blood shot, it was red and daily amount of light that hits his eye was very painful so he had to keep his eyes closed to keep light from coming in so he won&#39;t be in pain. Patient was not able to give the lot number because it hurts too much when he tried to turn on the light to reach that (vaccine). Events started on Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine in my left arm on Jan. 23rd. I had no side effects at the time, other than a sore arm, as with any shot. However, two days later I lost all hearing in my left ear. I had no history of ear infections or other ear or hearing problems, except for wax buildup two or three times. On Jan. 26th, I saw an ENT. To my dismay, there was no wax. He prescribed the standard treatment of Prednisone for Sudden Idiopathic Hearing Loss. No change after the first round, so I had a second round, and also had the series of three ear injections with Dexamethasone. Had an MRI, as well, which was normal. A couple of weeks into all this, I began to have a bit of sound-generated static in my ear, and this continues today. (Fortunately, I?ve only had the most minor of tinnitus in that ear, and even it is pretty much gone now.)

A 66-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Feb2021 at 10:00 AM (at the age of 66 years old) as a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HIV positive 31 years asymmetric high T-Cells undetectable viral load; Allergies to medications, food, Penicillin, sulfur drugs, Cypro and levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN); HIV positive, High blood pressure (HBP) and high cholesterol. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications (received within 2 weeks of vaccination) included HIV medication, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to vaccination.

The patient went to the emergency room and was told it&#39;s probably a side effect to vaccine and they saw nothing serious. The patient reported that he called 911 a few days later and was told the same thing. This episode occurs at least 3-4 times per week and lasts for about an hour and then goes away. Treatment was not received for the events. The events of Throbbing of tongue and tingling, Tingling around eye and nose, little dizzy required Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Since the vaccination, the patient was tested for COVID-19 (Antibody test as well as nasal swab) on 12Feb2021 with negative result. The clinical outcome of the events throbbing of tongue and tingling, tingling around eye and nose, little dizzy and Stuffiness was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

On March 10 it returned and worsened such that when I looked to the left my vision had a magnifying effect. After consulting with my Ophthalmologist and my primary physician it was decided that I should not at this time get my second shot scheduled for March 23 due to potential exacerbating problems from my March 2 first shot.  Further it was seen that my blood glucose was showing me diabetic for which I have begun medical treatment for type 2 diabetes.

Medical history included ongoing spastic paraplegia.  He has a genetic neurological condition, he has it is called spastic paraplegia.

Resolved after 150 minutes.  Interestingly, 8 days after the first dose (lot number EL 3247) had a similar but slightly milder reaction that lasted 24 hours. I do have Meniere?s with intermittent episodes like this for many years, but these two events were profoundly more severe than any in the past.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke on an unknown date. It was also reported that the patient was exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19 after receiving the vaccination (Jan2021); but the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Concomitant medications were not reported.  In Jan2021, after the vaccination, the patient experienced watery eyes, runny nose, a slight cough, and stomach pain.  The patient went to the walk-in clinic for the watery eyes and runny nose. He was given unspecified medication for the slight cough.  The clinical outcomes of the watery eyes, runny nose, and slight cough were recovered in Jan2021; while that of the stomach pain was not recovered.    The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The day I lost my lost my sight for little while, that day on the way home I was driving pass a restaurant with my windows up and I could smell barbeque sauce, pass an Italian restaurant and I could smell Italian food, and ever since then my smell has been back. I don&#39;t know I am not complaining at all, I am just telling something that, the doctors says I haven&#39;t heard of that, so that I thought you should know.&#34; The patient had bloodwork done with unknown results on unspecified date.

                                                Less than 2 days after vaccine Tinnitus has developed in both ears with a constant buzzing sensation and feeling of inflammation. Also feels like hearing ability is affected due to tinnitus sensation that is continuous 24/7. It has not diminished and is not getting better as of date of this report. I do not know if I should ghet another shot as do not want to lose my hearing. Will schedule an appointment with my ENT. I do not want to go deaf from this vaccine.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

I originally contributed the blisters to sunburn because I had been in the sun a lot the previous three days but I&#39;ve worked outside for years and I have never had my lip swell or had blisters on them in the past.  I have not been to a doctor at this point because the blisters appear to be healing so the blisters have not been diaganosed as being a covid vaccine reaction.

I couldn&#39;t walk or stand without holding on to something, touching the wall, a chair, or kitchen counter top, etc. It looked like everything was moving sideways. I measured my BP and O2; BP = 119/77, HR = 80; O2 = 98%, HR =77. I also felt nauseous and only had a piece bread with butter. I took a Nautamine tablet and slept for about 2 hrs, until 10:30. Things were better, I could move around and back to normal by 2 pm.

Took an additional 25 mg. Benadryl about 90 minutes after the injection.   This was the second injection.  A worse reaction, with noticeable swelling of throat and tongue, as well as difficulty breathing, after the first injection on March 1.  Only Benadryl, and not Prednisone, was taken on that occasion.

A 69-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6206 and Expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 12Mar2021 10:45 (at the age of 69-years-old) as 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, seasonal allergies (He controlled them with Zyrtec), hypertension-mild and pollen and grass allergies. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included amlodipine/losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for high blood pressure. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12Mar2021, 13:15 the patient eyes began to water and itch, slightly blurred vision, discharge in both eyes, sensitive to light, substantial fatigue. The patient had 2 major side effects. Both occurred about 2 hours after getting the vaccination. Both worsened as the day went on. The patient had involuntary squint because of itchy and watering eyes, dried discharge closing eyes in morning upon rising. They got significantly worse the following day. His eyes began to water and itch, and vision got slightly blurry. He attributed that to his eyes watering constantly. He does not wear glasses and has close to 20/20 even though he was old. He looks at computer and reads a lot. It got worse until Monday, then it abated slightly. It was still substantial. The right eye was worse than left. Two hours after watery and itching, he did not notice any blurry vision. That was later in the afternoon. As he was writing documents on computer and reading printed material was when he noticed it. There was enough discharge from the watering and tearing that when you wake up, you feel your eyes are glued closed. It has improved slightly in one eye. But it was the same or worse in right eye. Sensitivity to light began around 2 hours after the vaccination while he was in the car driving. Substantial fatigue got worse that night and was moderately bad Saturday, Sunday and Monday. It had abated moderately yesterday and then was worse yesterday and today, but better than the weekend. IT comes and goes and is not continuous. He has never had malaria but thinks it was the same feeling of overwhelming fatigue. He does not have any previous pre-existing conditions. It began with the vaccination. He was not a person of hypochondria and was not particularly worried about this. He was not worried about dying. They are simple side effects with any vaccine. The patient was disturbed when he looked it up. He did not see any symptoms being advertised about eye problems and he was very educated about it. Then when he looked it up, he saw others that had the same thing if not worse. He does not have any information for people that experienced the same thing that he read about online on the internet. Many symptoms that people were reporting were much more severe such as: eyes puffy, face swelling and eyes itchy and crusty. He must have seen 30-35 on two websites that reported and many more on websites on the internet. He then said it could have been 35-40 that he read carefully. Everyone in his family had the vaccine. His son had first dose and experienced no real symptoms. His wife who is a nurse had it 3 weeks ago and only a mild twinge in her arm. She experienced some fatigue yesterday for second dose. It was not really important and nothing that has not been reported. He did not wish to complete report. He was the healthiest person in the family, and he was surprised that he got these side effects. After he got the eye issues, he took Visine. Visine Advanced only clears were up for 10 minutes and then it comes right back. He only used it a few times because it was useless. If the vaccine had not blinded him, he could see the lot number easier. Lot is JJB0300 with expiration Sep2021. It was a total size of 0.284 ounces or 8ml. Visine Advanced gets rid of bloodshot eyes like for drunks. He does not drink though. He would not be willing to send a sample and it was sealed and intact. The patient uses the cetirizine (tablet, 10mg, Lot: 0EE27118 and Expiration date: Jan2022) oral from 13Mar2021 at 10mg twice a day taken for eye problems related to vaccine. The patient has been using and thought it might help with eye irritation. The patient took antihistamine as treatment for the events. The outcome of the event sensitive to light was recovering, eye irritation was unknown and other events were not recovered.

A 69-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 12Feb2021 at 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at 69-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Medical history included blood pressure high (HBP) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-fib) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing; and relevant past drug history: Yes, as reported (no details provided). Concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; hydrochlorothiazide (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and others as reported. On 12Feb2021 at 14:00, the patient experienced: vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes) (hospitalization, medically significant), and dizziness, giddiness, lightheadedness (hospitalization).  The patient was hospitalized for the events for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CT): result was not provided on an unspecified date, echocardiogram: result was not provided on an unspecified date, Nasal Swab: negative on 24Apr2021 (post vaccination). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included CT and echocardiogram (as reported). The clinical outcome of the events: vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes) was recovered on an unspecified date. The clinical outcome of the events: dizziness, giddiness, lightheadedness was recovering.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association, a causal relationship between the reported events partial vision loss for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision and dizziness, and the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. The causality was confounded by the patients preexisting cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and atrial fibrillation and multiple concomitant medications.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

                                                Tinnitus Worsened and my tinnitus is till worse than normal for me to this day.  Worsened tinnitus is primarily the right ear.  Left ear is currently normal.  I went to see PA  today and from her exam she indicated right ear drum looks normal.  Sinuses are somewhat swollen.  She wants me to use Afrin and Flonase for one week.  If that doesn&#39;t help, then low salt diet for one week.  If still no help, she will refer me to an ENT.

                                                On the afternoon following second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I began to experience worsening of myasthenia symptoms, principally diplopia and difficulty with swallowing.  Symptoms persisted the following day and on third day following I experienced very severe fatigue in combination with diplopia, ptosis of both eyelids, right side weakness and trouble swallowing.  Called doctor, who increased prednisone and today symptoms have almost entirely abated.

                                                Absolute ZERO side effects from first dose, not even a sore spot on injection location.  Migraine intensity headaches started 4 hours after injection of the second dose and lasted for approx. 40 hours. Went to sleep at 10:30 PM the night of the second dose and woke up in a startled state every half hour until I got out of bed at 5:30 AM.   From 5:30 AM until approx. 10 PM the day after my second dose I experienced seizure-like symptoms where I would seem to fall asleep while in a sitting position and awake just a minute(s) later in a confused state of mind. This would happen frequently and stopped its frequency slowly and stopped entirely late that same night.   I experienced eye pain to the point I had to apply ice bags to my face the entire day after the second dose. Body pain was so sever I cannot compare it to any other flu-like symptoms I&#39;ve ever had.   Totally recovered after 48 hours.

                                                pt had no sx until this morning.  Today pt woke up at 6am with tongue swollen and redness on one side of his tongue. no progression, no worsening, breathing ok and able to swallow.  Unable to confirm this is related to the vaccine, but possible. Since no progression and red area is only on one side of the tongue, I mentioned to also consider the possibility of sxs being due to him accidentally biting his tongue while sleeping. May take a dose of Benadryl-if indeed this is an allergy reaction, monitor yourself at home, f/u with pcp. Call 911 if any difficulty swallowing and/or difficulty breathing. Call back if any q. Will f/u.

Got hearing test on 2/15/21 which showed decreed hearing in right ear secondary to nerve conduction problem.  Within a few hours hearing got better, and hearing was retested the next day and found to be essentially back to normal.  I had taken Naprosyn on 2/15. MD had originally prescribed Prednisone bur I did not take since I was getting better without it. By 2/16/21 in the AM my hearing in the right ear seemed fine and there was no sense of fullness.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 71-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 09:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization (Age at vaccination: 71 years). Medical history included transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode from Mar2021, blocked carotid artery on his left side and tinnitus (had a history of Tinnitus in his left ear for about 4 years but he could hear). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BAYER ASPIRIN) for carotid artery blockage. The reporter stated that the patient was completely deaf in his left ear and had hearing loss on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he had walked straight into half of a wall because he was so off kilted on 27Mar2021 . The wife thinks the patient is not hearing well out of his right ear on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he is shrinking a little and the patient has gained weight on an unspecified date. The reporter also says that she thought that her husband&#39;s side effects started a little late after the vaccine date, has that been reported? Her husband had made the mistake of getting on the internet even though she said not to do that. She jokingly says that her husband is like a medical manual and he thinks that he is going to die from everything. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included height: shrinking and weight: gained on an unspecified date and CAT scan and MRI: Transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode on Mar2021. Outcome of the event deafness and hearing decreased was not recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) dose 2 via an unspecified route of admin-istration on 07Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included diabetes mellitus; he does not take medication for it. It was controlled by diet and exercise, high blood pressure, high lipids, herpes zoster from Oct2019, bell&#39;s palsy from Oct2019, herpes zoster oticus from Oct2019, paralysis, vertigo, ear disorder, paraesthesia oral and his tongue was tingly. Concomitant medications included alprazolam taken for sleep disorder, simvastatin taken for lipids increased, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for sleep disorder.  The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

Tee revealed no cardiac source of embolism. He is left with some expressive and receptive aphasia. He also has some loss of L eye vision. There was no stenosis of the carotid arteries but the left M2 branch was occluded. He did not have any atrial fibrillation in the hospital but is wearing a 30 day monitor currently.   We have no idea this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report. The Neurologist thinks it is just a coincidence.  But we still want you to know it happened.

                                                eye swelling; he had an allergy to the Covid 19; This is spontaneous report received from contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself.  A 72-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: BUD1230, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 17Feb2021 (age at vaccination was 72 years) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) and atenolol (ATENOLOL). The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL1284, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Jan2021 (age at vaccination was 72 years) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient has taken both doses. No additional vaccines were administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with any adverse event. In the original report caller stated that the patient reported he had an allergy to the Covid 19 vaccine 4 days after the first Covid 19 dose. He went to an allergist and the doctor asked him to wait 6 weeks until he took the second Covid 19 dose. After he received the second Covid 19 vaccine he had the same type of reaction as the first. The reaction was bumps on his scalp. Nothing major. He had taken Prednisone, Zyrtec at night, and Allegra in the morning. He recently has had bloodwork done and that bloodwork was sent to a lab. His concern was that lab results showed that he had a negative IGG serum so he doesn&#39;t have any Covid 19 antibodies. A culture was not performed. On an unspecified date, the patient also experienced eye swelling. The patient visited emergency room and physician office. The patient is a chemical engineer, not a biologist, but his theory is whether his immune system is keeping him from developing the antibodies. He doesn&#39;t know what to do now. He asked if he&#39;s protected. He asked if he should take a different type of Covid 19 vaccine that is not an mRNA vaccine. He was going to see his allergist again next Tuesday, 06Apr2021. He says there are people who developed the Covid 19 vaccine and he wants to call someone else and report his case. Someone who will pay attention to his case. None of the doctors that he visits have an answer about his allergy. He was taking the Prednisone after the first vaccine. He now takes Allegra in the morning and Zyrtec in the evening and that helps him. He also uses Cortisone10 cream where he has the bumps on his scalp. When he does that the number of bumps slowly disappear. No more swelling on the bumps. The bumps are on his scalp. He stopped using his shampoo and now uses baby shampoo. He reports after the first Covid 19 vaccine he didn&#39;t have a fever or felt tired, he didn&#39;t feel anything, just the bumps on his scalp appeared. He asked why he had no reaction right away after the first Covid 19 vaccine. He reported that it was 4-5 days after the first Covid 19 vaccine. He doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s the allergies or his immune system. After he stopped taking Prednisone, he continued to take the Allegra and Zyrtec and the bumps went away but then they appear in a different location. The bumps don&#39;t hurt or itch. In his original report he states he had enquired if he should get the second Covid 19 vaccine and he never received an answer. He continued to do everything he did before getting the Covid 19 vaccine. He still exercises, he bikes, he plays tennis. He&#39;s not tired or anything. When probing concomitant medications, he reported that his doctor recently changed his blood pressure medication from Losartan 25 mg to Amlodipine 2.5 mg. As a chemical engineer, and he&#39;s not a biologist, but he did the antibody test and he thought, what is his immune system doing. Whether his immune system is protecting him from the mRNA. He doesn&#39;t know. He would like someone who has the knowledge to answer his question. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

                                                Purkinje Tree and Covid-19 Vaccine. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and massively increased vaccinations, there have been few ocular side effects reported with the  vaccine. 1) However conjunctivitis has occurred with Covid-19 infection and very rarely endophthalmitis has been reported.  I wish to mention an otherwise unreported association with visualization of a Purkinje Tree and Pfizer Covid-19 second vaccine. I am a 73 year old otherwise healthy retired male. I had an entoptic experience after I received my second vaccine.  With the first vaccine I had no visual side effects.  The afternoon of my second dose I took an hour long  nap, which was unusual for me.  When I woke up and opened my eyes I noticed a bilateral arborizing, interlacing dark pattern that lasted less than a second. This was opaque but without a ghost image and otherwise the wall, sheet,  and ceiling were seen clearly behind that network.   I experimented with opening and shutting either and both eyes looking at a white sheet beneath me, and found that especially with my dominant left eye I saw a pattern resembling my left eye retinal vascular tree.  The branches originated as single vessels  superiorly and inferiorly that branched down to smaller vessels  all on the right side of a disc type structure without duplication into an identifiable arteriolar and  venous system. Even with a light source moving over my left shoulder,  the image never lasted longer than a fraction of a second and fatigued quickly with repetition.  I laid back down and repeated the experiment of opening and shutting either eye while looking at a white ceiling. Then the image changed to a horizontally oriented pattern with two single black vessel type structures coming off a disc type structure.  The dark lines further branched and narrowed as they extended to the right and left off the disc type structure.  Again this lasted less than a second. It faded away rather than floated away. The image always appeared in the same area of my field of vision. It was peri-central when I looked at the wall and inferior to fixation when I looked at the ceiling.   The image would immediately move with eye movement, unlike a vitreous floater. Opening and shutting my left eye could refresh the image very briefly but that fatigued with repetition and could not be reproduced after 3-4 trials or without several hours between attempts. I did  translations of Purkinje?s description of the Tree (described here later.)  and had short term  partial success with his methods, except for pushing on  my eye, and using galvanic current,  which I did not attempt.  I declined a full exam but did  remember a lecture about Purkinje images.  He had the residents hold pen lights to the side of their eyes and move the light back and forth while he  described the Purkinje Tree. Afterwards he quizzed the residents about whether they could see it or not, with the ?humorous? disclaimer that it was a means of IQ testing if they could see it.  Half could.  It was of interest to me that  before I retired,  occasionally patients would mentions seeing the tree after an ophthalmoscopic exam.  I hoped to delight those patients by  telling them it was a form of IQ quiz and they had done well.  Two weeks later I was disappointed that I could no longer see the tree, but again declined an exam.  I am optically conversant, but physically adverse in seeking self care.   Purkinje first described the ?Tree?2) in his doctorate thesis in 1819. It was included in descriptions of other entoptic phenomena, performed mostly on himself. This was before the ophthalmoscope was discovered and before quality histological, serial sections were available.  He described holding a candle or using galvanic illumination in front of his eyes individually and moving it around.  He could see  black lines in a network that came off a central pit structure.  There were two lines inferiorly and superiorly with adjacent shadows and ultimately had size reducing branches.  He recognized these branching lines as retinal blood vessels, but could not discern any blood flow.  In 1825 he published a further volume 3) that dealt with experiments he subsequently had performed.  He found that by holding a sheet of paper with a hole in it that he moved around,  he could get a better view of the blood vessel pattern.  He could discern the macula and described anastomosing blood vessels superior to inferior.  A significant improvement in his discerning the blood vessel pattern was obtained with a safe amount of pressure on the superior lateral aspect of the eye.  With this he could recognized blood corpuscles and flow patterns and then labeled the lines as veins. He did not describe arteriole patterns.  So this leaves us with the question why this sudden awareness of the Purkinje Tree appeared in the time frame of a second Covid-19 vaccine.  This will require further reports to determine coincidence versus cause-effect.  This is a high stress time with Covid-19 deaths so prevalent. I had immediate relief after my second shot with a reduction of tension and increase in awareness of my general physical status as in the feeling of being hot or cold, sleepy or just fatigued, improved calmness, and the pertinent Purkinje Tree.  At sign in for the second series of Pfizer injections the RN on duty asked about side effects from the first shot.  She asked us to send a report in of any potential side effect then of the second shot and notified us that people were having more problems with the second shot than the first. Arm soreness, swelling, fever, chills, headache,  malaise, fatigue.  She gave us a print out list of known side effects, mostly systemic and all mild, but nothing ophthalmic.  With these things  in mind I was especially vigilant of any thing new in my general health or condition.  Most of the patients getting the shots were students and the congregating area was in a wing of a hospital.  This brought back the pleasant memory of my time in training and  my chief?s description of Purkinje?s Tree and perhaps enhanced the  brief ability to see the entoptic image.  In between times playing with this image my vision was normal and  my general health remained good, without symptoms of vascular compromise.

A 73-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included psoriasis , cardiac pacemaker insertion on an unknown date (He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago) , hypertension from an unknown date.      The patient  died three days after taking the vaccine  on 09Apr2021 , he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 150/90   on  09Apr2021.    It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Course of the event: The reporter&#39;s uncle died three days after taking the vaccine. He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature. He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago and has a history of psoriasis and HTN. There is additional concomitant medical history I will have to confirm.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment for the reported patient&#39;s sudden death.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 vaccination; adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1132646) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose, subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1136949) to Mar2021, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient medical history includes ear infection. Concomitant medications were not reported. On unknown dates, the patient experienced tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles and whole left side of face and eye swollen. In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

Yesterday, February 2nd, in  the late afternoon I became very red and itchy and my tongue swelled. I went to  the emergency room where they gave me sodium chloride, Benadryl,  Pepcid and 2 &#34;epi&#34; shots. After about 4 hours I was sent home. Could that have  been a reaction to my Covid vaccine? Today I am tired but fine and swelling is  gone. I had told the person who scheduled my first shot and the person who  vaccinated me that I was taking Skyrizi injections for psoriasis and had my  last injection of Skyrizi on Dec 15.&#34;

                                                I received the two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. I was given the second dose (2/3/21) three weeks after the first dose (1/13/21). Some time after receiving the first dose, I noticed a subtle but definite strange feeling all around my mouth and tongue, like a &#34;film&#34; over everything. I also noticed a loss of taste. I suffered from anosmia and dysgeusia many years ago, but through medical intervention, I gained back over 90% of smell and 80% of taste. Now I&#39;ve noticed more loss of taste again, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence that it&#39;s happened while getting vaccinated. I just hope that I regain taste (which is only 45-50% now maybe) as time goes by.

Immediately I had burning sensation on the upper jaw inside the mouth as if I had drank real hot drink. It felt like the skin on the upper jaw is going to peel off. Then I brushed my teeth and took my tablets. After swallowing I got burning sensation in my Stomach. Both feelings subsided after some time may be half hour.

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.  He had some pain in the arms particularly at the injection site initially but that has resolved.  He had dry mouth up until February 2nd.  By February 2nd he could start to transfer a bit better from a chair to his driver seat in the van.  He is still not back to his baseline function.
