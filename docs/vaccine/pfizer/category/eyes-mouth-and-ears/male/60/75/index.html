The next day Thursday I had a visual deficite in my eye along with the floaters.  By Friday evening I went up to see the eye doctor while at work and was advised I had 5 tears to the retina of my right eye and was advised it needs to be repaired immediately. On 1/9 I had a vitrectomy and the tears in the retina were repaired as well.  I was advised the surgery had an 85% success rate but advised I will develop a cataract in the eye within 6months but within 6 weeks it developed. 2/22 I had the cataract removed  and a lense replaced in my right eye.

Then starting on the 3rd day until present, I feel extremely light-headed and unsteady with a persistent severe headache.  Almost feels like there is pressure in my head for lack of a better description. I feel feverish as well but do not have a fever.  I have difficulty maintaining balance on my feet so it is difficult to walk.   I did seek medical attention yet since I live alone and do not feel comfortable to drive. Although the symptoms are difficult, I also don&#39;t consider them an emergency to warrant calling an ambulance.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It got worse over the New Year&#39;s weekend, and now seems to be stabilized as a constant ringing.  I will be making an appointment this coming week to have it investigated, but wanted to get the preliminary information to you. I have experienced a much lesser degree of tinnitus in the past, always a momentary transient event, not nearly as loud as I am currently experiencing.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 25Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing urinary incontinence (use of medication that does not make him run to the bathroom and helps him hold his urine), ongoing acne, drowsy, and ongoing flow of urine or weak bladder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fesoterodine fumarate (TOVIAZ; Expiration Date: 04Dec2021) (about 2 weeks prior to getting the COVID-19 vaccine) for urinary incontinence, doxycycline (Expiration Date: 26Nov2021; makes him drowsy) for acne, and tamsulosin (Expiration Date: 12Nov2021) for flow of urine or weak bladder; all from Jan2021 and ongoing. The patient does not take any of these medications while driving. The patient took his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 25Jan2021 (Monday). The patient had been experiencing dizziness which started a few days after getting the vaccine (Jan2021). The patient was supposed to work from Tuesday to Friday, but he did not go into work on Wednesday. The patient was unsure of the specific day the dizziness started. The patient did have allergies (unspecified date), but when he called in his doctor, he sent him a medication for allergies, meclizine (Expiration Date: 28Jan2022). Normally, the medication takes a couple days to make him feel better. After he took meclizine for dizziness, he feels better. The patient notices the dizziness when he is up and moving around. The patient can tell something is off, like his equilibrium is off in Jan2021. It may not be due to the shot, but looking at the paper it says tiredness, which he has been feeling fatigued (also started a few days after the vaccine, but he is unsure specifically what day) and dizziness, which he has in Jan2021. The medication he is taking (meclizine), can also do the same thing, but never for this long. When he takes it, it normally makes him feel better after a few days. The patient has sinus problems as well on an unspecified date, but never lasting this long. The patient had not started feeling better since taking the medication, meclizine (as reported). The patient also said that meclizine could be causing the fatigue because it does make his drowsy and he just sleeps when he takes it - he cannot take it when he drives. The patient would go back for the second dose on 15Feb2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Dizziness when he is up and moving around&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Allergies&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

                                                I have chronic Lyme disease, with extreme symptoms of photosensitivity and photophobia.  12 years ago, I had a series of intravenous antibiotics for 9 months.  That halted the progression of the symptoms.  However, with the first injection of the Pfizer vaccine, I had an immediate and increasing photosensitivity/photophobia.  For example, my computer monitor was at 6% brightness.  I reset to 3% brightness, which is still too bright.  My concern is that the second injection due on February 12th may further increase the symptoms.  My Lyme doctor believes that the light sensitivity is perhaps coming from the thalamus.  Additionally, the injection seemed to increase my INR.

                                                The patient presented yesterday to an urgent care center on 3/11/2021 with chest pain, jaw pain, and shortness of breath. He reports multiple occurrences over the past week.  He was sent to the ED, where he was then admitted for hypertensive urgency/emergency vs. unstable angina.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination on the morning of 2/17/21 with no resulting initial sequelae other than injection site tenderness. Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine in my left arm on Jan. 23rd. I had no side effects at the time, other than a sore arm, as with any shot. However, two days later I lost all hearing in my left ear. I had no history of ear infections or other ear or hearing problems, except for wax buildup two or three times. On Jan. 26th, I saw an ENT. To my dismay, there was no wax. He prescribed the standard treatment of Prednisone for Sudden Idiopathic Hearing Loss. No change after the first round, so I had a second round, and also had the series of three ear injections with Dexamethasone. Had an MRI, as well, which was normal. A couple of weeks into all this, I began to have a bit of sound-generated static in my ear, and this continues today. (Fortunately, I?ve only had the most minor of tinnitus in that ear, and even it is pretty much gone now.)

                                                transient bilateral blurry vision; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.  A 67-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (Patient age and high risk medically).  Medical history included ongoing spastic paraplegia.  He has a genetic neurological condition, he has it is called spastic paraplegia. He does not have an onset date just that it was years ago and is still an ongoing thing at this time. He believes there is a remote family history of the same neurological condition. Patient is not diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient previously took flu vaccine on 18Nov2020, almost 2 months prior. The patient experienced transient bilateral blurry vision on 11Jan2021 11:20.  Caller is asking for recommendations regarding the 2nd dose for the patient who experienced blurriness of vision. Caller reporting a patient who received the first dose of the Vaccine yesterday (11Jan2021) and developed transient bilateral blurry vision at 11:00am, 20-30 mins after the dose. He said that it was resolved within 18-24 hrs after. He is asking if there were any reports of this in the clinical trial. It was further reported that caller is calling about the COVID vaccine. He says he was curious, he is a clinical director in (and he was calling to report or see if anyone had reported this. The patient received his first dose of the vaccine yesterday (11Jan2021) and for less than 24 hours had transient bilateral blurry vision. He says by the second day it had totally resolved. It started about 20 minutes after the first dose and resolved within 24 hours. He did not think it met criteria to report but he wondered if they would like to him report that and see if anyone had seen that at all. Event began on 11Jan2021 about 15-20 minutes after the vaccine was given and was resolved completely within 24 hours. For the dose, he believed the patient received 0.3 ml, whatever the standard dose is. He thought the Pfizer one is 0.3 ml. He says the nurses do that he just does the medical screening but he thinks the Pfizer one is 0.3 ml and (name) is 0.5 ml but he is older so he may be wrong. No further information provided. For the anatomical location of administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, he stated it was on one of the deltoids, he is not sure which. Vaccination Facility Type was outpatient clinic. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, they screen for those and he has not had any other vaccines for at least 2 weeks. It was further reported that vaccine given roughly about 11 AM and the symptoms began 11:20 AM. He called the patient this morning at 9:30 AM and he said the blurry had resolved. He says he spoke with the patient&#39;s wife and she asked the patient if it was resolved and he said yes. They did not provide the caller with the time that the blurry vision resolved. Caller says he did send the patient to their in house optometrist for an exam and the exam was unremarkable by the optometrist. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He also wanted to know if they could advise whether or not to give the second dose. The outcome of the event was recovered on 12Jan2021.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

A 68-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: E9262), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, over weight, lost my sense of smell, border line diabetic and a heart condition that is hereditary it has to deal with the elasticity of the vessels; all from unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was administered first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and experienced the regular signs, a little bit of a headache, little dizziness in the morning, and cognitively was little not there for about an hour. Concomitant medication included lisinopril, metformin hydrochloride (ROBUSTIN) and vitamins. The patient stated, &#34;for the second shot the 2nd day I was at school letting kids out and all of a sudden my sight started to go. It started getting blurry and I got back into the building and my Principal said let&#39;s just call the doctors, I said I can&#39;t see my phone to get, find his number. They took care of that for me and it lasted about an hour and hour and half and my sight came back. That&#39;s was the only negative and the positive thing happened, I have lost my sense of smell 10 years ago from taking a prescription for high blood pressure I mean diabetes (unspecified medication). Within a month I lost complete smell of everything, for 10 years I have not been able to smell a thing. The day I lost my lost my sight for little while, that day on the way home I was driving pass a restaurant with my windows up and I could smell barbeque sauce, pass an Italian restaurant and I could smell Italian food, and ever since then my smell has been back.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.  He had some pain in the arms particularly at the injection site initially but that has resolved.  He had dry mouth up until February 2nd.  By February 2nd he could start to transfer a bit better from a chair to his driver seat in the van.  He is still not back to his baseline function.
