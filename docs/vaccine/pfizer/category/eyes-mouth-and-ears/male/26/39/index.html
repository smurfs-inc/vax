                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

                                                After receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I was experiencing headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, and nausea. The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

                                                Patient presented with puffy eyes approximately 4 minutes after vaccination. Was alert and oriented to time, person, and place upon questioning and was able to engage in conversation. Parent (mother) of patient was present who gave patient&#39;s medical history and reported allergy to grass with similar reaction.  Blood pressure was taken and found to be 150/80. Mother reported patient had not taken his blood pressure medicine yet that day but his normal is 115/70 with  medication. While nurse was assessing patient&#39;s pulse (patient&#39;s pulse was WNL at 85) and other nursing staff was obtaining medication to administer if needed after assessment, patient became unresponsive to verbal commands and his upper body became limp. At 1054, a one time, single dose of 50 mg of diphenhydramine IM was given in the left deltoid. On site EMT arrived on the scene at 1055, completed assessment, and confirmed giving diphenhydramine was the best course of action. At this time, 1055, patient became responsive to verbal commands and was oriented to time, place, and person. At 1056 O2 sat was at 97%, pulse 70, and at 1100, BP was 110/70. Patient stayed for observation 30 more minutes and remained stable. Patient and parent were educated on side effects of diphenhydramine, to watch for any returning symptoms of allergic reaction throughout the day, and if/when to head to the ER. Recommended patient not receive 2nd dose of COVID vaccination.

                                                I took notes during my wait time: -6 minutes in my throat felt weird, but different than normal allergic reactions to foods. I prepared my Epi-Pen so I have easier access at this time. -9 minutes in the sides of my tongue were slightly itchy. -11 minutes in and I felt as though the saliva in the back of my throat was thicker and I needed to clear my throat a bit more often, similar to allergic reactions. -15 minutes in, I felt my heart pound once out of beat, but my heart rhythm returned to normal immediately. Tongue itchiness also became intermittent rather than constant. -18 minutes in, overall condition improved and I felt better. -22 minutes in, my throat felt scratchy like I would if I consumed legumes (chickpeas, green peas, soy beans, etc.) but also oddly warm, which was out of the norm.  No treatments needed given mild reactions. I went to work, but notified my co-workers of my reaction, so if my condition worsens they can help administer my Epi-Pen. I am reporting this at 9:21 am on 03/05/2021, roughly an hour after my first dose.

                                                Woke at 3:50am. Right ear felt as though it very much needed to pop; internal pressure beyond external areas where finger can access. Hearing very much muffled. Not tinnitus (no ringing, screeching, etc.), which I have had before (in this ear), or if it were tinnitus then a very different tinnitus. Ear not significantly different by current time, 11:10am.   Though no scientific background to connect ear issue to vaccine received around 40 hours prior, no other changes in habit or precursors.

                                                This was my second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. I took some notes during my waiting time following my injection similar to my first dose. Information from my last report can be found using Temporary VAERS E-Report No: 334845. Of note, I did prepare for my second dose by taking Benadryl 50 mg and Airborne Immune-Boost supplements the night before my second dose, so my symptoms were not as severe as last time.  6 minutes: Mild tingling around tongue. This time all around the edges of my tongue, but a lot less bothersome than the first dose. 8 minutes: Weird. Slight itchiness under left half of tongue. Still very mild but less concerning than first dose itchiness on the left and right sides of my tongue. 18 minutes: Itchy on right side slightly, only side noticeable. 20 minutes: Mild warm feeling on left side of top of my throat. Less bothersome than time. 26 minutes: Left throat warm ness resolved, but transitioned to right side of top of my throat. 31 minute: Throat warmness overall resolved, but slightly itchy on edge of right side of my tongue. 37 minutes: Top of throat on right feels weird but not itchy. Warm maybe? 39 minutes: Weird feeling on right side of throat resolved.  Symptoms more or less resolved the rest of the day, especially after second dose of Flonase @ 9:00 am.  14 hours later: About to go to bed. Feeling fatigued, similar to my first dose after working out. Took airborne and two Benadryl (25 mg each) before sleeping.  24 hours later: 03/27/2021, feeling more fatigued, groggy, mild headache (mostly at back of my head), and muscle aches around my body.  25 hours later: Groggy feeling and fatigue resolved. Possibly due to Benadryl or vaccine?  32 hours later: Majority of muscle aches resolved. Headache also resolved. Feeling mostly soreness at this point.  Drank Airborne @ 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. In between drank plenty of fluids (water, cranberry juice, apple juice, milk). No fever or chills.

A 26-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 17:45, at the age of 26 years old, (Batch/Lot Number: EW0170) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Tetanus shot and after 5-10 mins of it he lost conscious for a while. The patient experienced lost conscious on 22Apr2021 07:45 with outcome of recovered, vaccination site pain on 20Apr2021 with outcome of recovered, vision blurred on 22Apr2021 with outcome of recovered.

He stepped in shower and stood under water for sometime then he removed the band-aid from the left arm (where the shot is given) within fraction of seconds he fell down (lost conscious) on the left hand side from the bath tub (him legs still in the bath tub) after sometime he woke up and now fell in the bath tub. After sometime he woke up, and he barely could see, tied him towel and came out to him room and laid down for a while. Then everything went back to normal. The patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the events.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  The patient was diagnosed with covid on 30Dec2020 with outcome of recovering.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test: positive on 30Dec2020. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with covid on 30Dec2020. The patient had COVID test on 30Dec2020 and received positive result of COVID test on 31Dec2020. He was scheduled for the second dose between 08Jan2021 and 11Jan2021. He asked if he should continue to get the second dose as scheduled in relation to the diagnosis of COVID. COVID: the patient still had chest congestion, but no fever without medication, no cough anymore. He was having cough, fever, loss of taste and smell, fatigue and malaise. Reporter seriousness for COVID: Not serious. Relatedness of drug to reaction/event:  Reaction assessed: COVID, Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection, Drug result: Unrelated. Verbatim event relatedness: Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: COVID-Unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 30Dec2020.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the diagnosed COVID-19 likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use, and unrelated to BNT162B2.

The following day I started having feverish feelings, runny nose, continued cough, slight sore throat, fatigue. The day after that, Jan 17th, I had all the previous listed symptoms as well as loss of taste and some loss of smell.

Today, Tuesday, Jan 19th, I took a rapid test for COVID 19 and tested positive. Today I am experiencing fatigue, slight amount of confusion, slightly sore throat.

I took an antihistamine and the next day the swelling was essentially all gone.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

                                                Pt. was vaccinated by another pharmacist at our remote clinic at an elementary school at 11:35am 3/11/21. Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Apr2021 at 14:30 as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 27 years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included coarctation of the aorta from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing coarctation of aorta (age: 3 months), only requires bi-annual cardiologist visits, loss of consciousness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. The patient had no know allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed on 16Apr2021 at 14:30. Circulation issues leading to a black out. Within 60 seconds of getting the shot, he began to feel light-headed. Within 30 seconds of that, he knew he needed help, so alerted the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) via car horn/flashers. By the time they arrived (120 seconds from the initial shot), he lost his vision and hearing and was essentially unresponsive. They woke him enough to unlock my car door, at which point they had him lay back to improve his circulation. That ultimately worked and got him back to normal within about 5 minutes. The patient had issues like this before relating to a coarctation of his aorta which he had done at 3 months of age. Over the years, he has &#34;blacked out&#34; like this from weight lifting and other high exertion things. This was the first time it was induced without him overexerting himself, and the onset of the &#34;blackout&#34; was much quicker than what he had experienced from weightlifting. Normally, he could tell 1-3 minutes in advance that he would black out. This time, it was about 30 seconds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lost vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and feel light-headed. EMTs did an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood glucose check. The outcome of lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

After 5-6 minutes he notes a syncopal episode that he describes as feeling like he randomly fell asleep. When this occurred, he fell back in his chair and hit his head.

While he was being brought to the ED in a wheelchair he began experiencing blurry vision again and his face became very pale. He was given some apple juice and reports that after 5-10 minutes he felt back to normal. While his vitals were being taken, his HR and BP were very low and he experienced another episode. Pt does not have a hx of passing out 2/2 needles and notes that he gets a flu shot every year and is totally fine. He does note that he became queasy when he tried to give blood in the past but that this does not normally happen. Of note, pt denies any leg swelling prior to these episodes. Pt endorses a low baseline HR in the 50s per his Fitbit but otherwise denies any known heart problems. He notes a fhx of heart problems and states that his dad had heart bypass surgery a couple years ago. Pt denies any daily medications other than vitamin gummies. Denies DVT risk factors or prior history of DVT.

Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

The volume of the ringing has decreased, but now it&#39;s a constant low ANNOYING hum.  It&#39;s been about three weeks, and I&#39;m very worried about getting my second shot now, there was a HUGE forum about people who have had this reaction and had the second shot aggrevate it further.  https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/tinnitus-reports-grow-amid-covid-19-vaccinations/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Vaccine%20Adverse%20Event,(loss%20of%20hearing%20acuity).

This 30-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EK5730), via an unspecified routed of administration, on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 30-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS). The patient just wanted to know how long a low grade fever is in the patients, it&#39;s been like three days now she still has low grade fever, mouth sore, sore throat and she is still so weak. The patient was treated with Tylenol. Outcome was not recovered.   The reporting nurse considered the events related to the vaccine because the events started after that.

All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

A 30-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant drug. The patient experienced recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid on 04Jan2021 00:30, mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage on 31Dec2020, loss of smell on 02Jan2021, exhaustion/feeling tired on 03Jan2021, felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe, he still has his sense of taste, but it is dulled on an unspecified date. He was a pharmacist. He received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on Thursday 31Dec2020 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he got the typical side effects of the vaccine that are posted. Then 2.5 days letter he no longer had a sense of smell. Everything he read said that he probably came in contact with COVID prior to administration. His questions was since he test positive for COVID, should he still get the second shot. He got it at a clinic. He did experience mild congestion which started by 6 o&#39;clock. He started to notice slight congestion that kind of went away. Then, on Friday, about 24 hours later, he really noticed he had congestion. He took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). Then his sense of smell diminished with the congestion and felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe. On Saturday, he decided to not take medication. That was when he noticed he could not smell anything. He had full blown congestion. It probably took two days when he started to lose his sense of smell. He received the shot on Thursday. On Saturday, he lost his sense of smell. He still has his sense of taste, but it was dulled. Sunday, he was just exhausted and feeling tired. These were all listed as typical side effects except for the loss of smell. Saturday was the worst. The congestion went into full nasal drainage. On Sunday he had no sinus issues. He still hasn&#39;t gained his sense of smell back. The exhaustion set in Sunday 03Jan2020. He doesn&#39;t feel like any of the side effects are serious. The exhaustion has started to let up some so it is improving. He was pretty much back to normal. He just couldn&#39;t figure out why he had a loss of smell. He had a COVID rapid test on 04Jan2021 at 8:30 am (as reported). He received an alert and hour later that it was positive. He was wondering whether the loss of smell could be from the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 rapid POC test: positive on 04Jan2021. The outcome of events for mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage was resolved on 03Jan2021, for loss of smell was not resolved, for exhaustion/feeling tired was resolving, for other events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported event &#34;recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid&#34; is considered possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known drug safety profile.

                                                I am experiencing severe ringing in the ears (tinnitus) that occured within 24 hours post getting the vaccine. I am still experiencing ringing in the ears and have since made an appointment with my ENT to determine if there are any other possible issues. I never had ringing in the ears prior to the  vaccine.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

I also couldn&#39;t focus and I was experiencing vision problems meaning I had trouble seeing. All these problems I wasn&#39;t experiencing any of them before the ??. I wasn&#39;t watching the time but everything lasted till I made it home and took my pain medication. If more information is needed please feel free to reach out to me.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

                                                As a person who has never had any kind of allergies--including seasonal allergies--as of the week I received the vaccine, I appear to have developed a new allergy to dust mites. When resting my head against a pillow (especially near the open end of the pillow case), I develop sneezing, complete sinus congestion (to the point I am not able to breathe from either nostril), runny eyes, and similar histamine responses. The symptoms have responded well to diphenhydramine and loratadine, as well as use of allergen-resistant pillowcases, but they have reduced my sleep quality in the weeks since they developed, and I feel this new allergy has negatively impacted my quality of life.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, depressed mood, brain fog, irritability, tinnitus, body temperature fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. No treatment was received for the events. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The event outcome was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded. However the clinical course, relevant medical history and concomitant medications are pending for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

                                                About one hour after injection developed left facial numbness while I was on my way home. Not full numbness, but felling as if coming out of a novocaine shot. Left side chin, lips, cheek extending up to ear/eye. No sign of swelling, droop, redness. Has lasted 2 weeks &#43; and has improved over time but not fully resolved. Now is more an occasional numb feeling mostly in L cheek/lips/corner of L eye. I grind my teeth during stressful times and grind more on my left side so was thinking it could be related to that. Sought medical attention from my doctor who felt said most likely not Bell&#39;s palsy related.

My colleague is also experiencing this...in her case beginning 1 wk after dose #1 (I encouraged her to report this too not sure if she has yet). I find it fascinating both people are experiencing this after the vaccine and as an NP I felt compelled to report to help aggregate such data.  Both my friend and colleague obtained the vaccine around the same time at the same clinic.  Thank you!

                                                Patient stated his heart rate was racing, he was visibly sweating, and had tunnel vision. He stated he felt like he was having an anxiety attack. This was 5-15 minutes post vaccination as he was being observed. We laid him on the ground and he immediately started to feel better. After a few minutes he sat up and drank some orange juice. Paramedics were called but patient was able to walk away on own accord. Called  later and was doing fine.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  I got the vaccine on Friday, and on Saturday night I developed phantosmia. Until now, basically 55h hours after the first shot, I feel cigarette smell very frequently. Sometimes is weak, sometimes is strong, but there are rare moments that I don&#39;t feel it at all - usually noticed when I start to feel it again. In the beginning, I thought that it could be caused by a roommate, but when I talked with them no one was smoking or feeling the smoke smell. When I came to lab, a clean space, I felt it again and noticed that it was really abnormal and that I should report. Additional info: I had a positive test for COVID-19 on January 16th and recovered really well after having only a mild fever for one day and a sore throat for 4 days. I am sure I also had COVID-19 in January of 2020 after a trip, when I had very bad symptoms including heavy lungs, pain in the lungs, yellow mucus, coughing, sore throat, headaches, and fever - and also a negative test for Flu at my health center.  At that time, mainly because of the negative test, doctors described it as a strong cold. It lasted for two weeks. We didn&#39;t think it could be COVID at that time, though. I realized that later when we learned more about the symptoms.

A 31-year-old male patient received of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Pfizer, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 (age at vaccination 31 years) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Reportedly, there were no known allergies to medications, food or other products other medical history. Patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient was complaining of right facial weakness since 04Apr2021 (the day before yesterday), drooping face, has difficulty closing right eye. It was associated with headache, neck pain. The neck and headache pain scale was 7/10 for 4-5 days. It was reported that pain comes and goes. The headache was less when he works and exercise. But the headache was more severe at night. It was hard to get into sleep last night. There was no n/v/c/d, blurred vision, cp, sob, doe, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, etc. There was no rash, numbness. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The reporter assessed the case as non-serious with no seriousness criteria (Seriousness criteria-Results in death/ Seriousness criteria-Life threatening/ Seriousness criteria-Caused/prolonged hospitalization/ Seriousness criteria-Disabling/Incapacitating/ Seriousness criteria-Congenital anomaly/birth defect). No treatment was given for adverse events. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drooping face cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

Pt states that this is sudden onset today. he is unsure if it is related to the recent covid vaccine but has otherwise been well. He has no recent viral sx. He has no other neuro sx. He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

                                                everything was muffled and he had constant ringing in the ears; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at single dose as his first dose, via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 06Jan2021 at single dose as his second dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. There included unspecified medications and stopped several of them a week ago on 05Jan2021. The patient was having a side effect that popped up out of the middle of nowhere, and he went through his meds, and he wanted to see if anyone else was having these issues. The patient was having ringing in both ears that happened late Dec2020, and in the beginning of Jan2021, and he had both rounds, he was an RN (registered nurse) at a hospital, and the ringing had gotten louder, and the only thing, medication, drug, that he took PO, over the counter, the only thing that correlates was it happened after both vaccines, later clarified as COVID vaccines. Right before the second dose, it was really really loud, and then he got the second dose, and over the last 1.5 weeks, the ringing has gotten worse in both ears, so he called his primary care, who referred him to ENT (ear, nose and throat), and he saw ENT, and to look in the ear, he said it was the nerve, he didn&#39;t know what triggered it in both ears, he said it was usually only in one ear if it&#39;s a viral thing, so it&#39;s uncommon in both ears, and the doctor asked if he was on medication, and the caller stopped several of them a week ago on 05Jan2021, that would cause it, but it had gotten worse. The patient didn&#39;t know etiology or how the vaccine worked, but he tested for COVID and it was negative, and his doctor was asking him if he experienced this any other time, told him to stop medications, and it&#39;s gotten worse, asked him if he was on any recreational drugs, he was on no new meds, he was a nurse, and works in ICU, and basically didn&#39;t know where it come from, but suddenly, everything was muffled and he had constant ringing in the ears. COVID test was about 2 weeks ago, the rapid was negative, then the PCR was negative. The outcome of event was recovering.

Seemed worthy of reporting given the likely timing of my peak antibody response at the 14d mark and general vaccine monitoring concerns of cross reactive antibody responses.

By the weekend it hadn?t gotten worse to the point where I couldn?t leave the bedroom due to the walls literally spinning. That?s as the worst day then it progressively lessened until it went away by the second week.  Thought it was worth a mention.  My gf that I live with has also had ringing in her ear non stop since the second vaccine, so I?m a little concerned about the second shot.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

March 2 I started to feel my chest burning and I had to catch my breathe going up the  stairs and taking also took a lot out of me to do.  Still on March 2 around 11 pm I lost my smell and taste.

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

I then experienced a headache in just above the base of my neck in the back of my head and that lasted for approximately 5 minutes.

                                                I have some mild tinnitus which I&#39;ve had for 15 years since high school and rarely bothers me. Go months without noticing it.   A few hours after my first dose of Pfizer (left arm), I got a headache and some queasiness. The expected side effects. My ears started ringing louder and more pronounced, which I assumed was a side-effect of the headache and/or immune response to the vaccine. It&#39;s past two weeks now since dose 1 and my ears are still ringing much more loudly and noticeably than in the last 15 or so years. All other side effects have long ago subsided. It seems to be worse in left ear, the same side I got shot on. I imagine that&#39;s irrelevant, but mentioning it anyway here.   Distracting and distressing.  Am scheduled for a second dose on April 21 and now hesitant about getting it.

The patient reported &#34;Received the shot and waited in the parking lot for the 15 minutes. No negative effects whatsoever during the 15 minutes, and I was cleared to leave. As I am driving out of the parking lot, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/nauseous, and my vision becomes extremely blurry, even to the point of near blindness. I stopped the car and sat for about 30 seconds/1 minute until my vision returned sufficiently to drive back to the waiting area where I requested water. I immediately felt better with the water, and the staff also gave me benadryl although I don&#39;t think it had any impact. I felt weak for an additional 30 minutes or so and spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. I felt fine to drive after this 30 minutes and have had no side effects since.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of even to the point of near blindness, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/felt weak, nauseous and my vision becomes extremely blurry. No treatment was reported for the event spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. Outcome of the events was recovered on 31Mar2021.

A 33-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Mar2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the vaccination in the pharmacy. There was no medical history or concomitant medications. There were no other vaccines administered in the last four weeks.

The clinical course was as follows: the patient was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. He set an alarm. He bought some food to eat (potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22. He felt strange/weird, but this was not an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for the patient. He was driving to work and started to get a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later, he started to get dizzy, ears rang, felt blood pressure drop, and passed out going freeway speeds. He was treated in the emergency department and released the same day. There was no treatment given in response to the events. There was no covid prior to or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6).

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

My eyelids became puffy and the area around my eyes was swollen and ached. My eyes were also very sensitive to light. This started on the morning of day 2 and is still lingering, but better, by day 4.

The infection didn&#39;t go away, seemed to get worse with worsening headache/eye pain/fatigue and nasal congestion/post nasal drip. I requested a nasal swab by my provider to identify what was going on in my nose.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

Within 48 more hours, that symptom has become less frequent but a permanent ringing noise (tinnitus) has developed.  It is primarily in my left ear but can seemingly be heard in both ears.  It has not stopped since I noticed it around 4/04. I have been checked by an ENT and they noted no conditions and my hearing/pressure/nerve tests all came back as normal.  I have never had any previous tinnitus issues whatsoever.

                                                Started with tingling of the tongue and itchiness of the arms. I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen.

Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

                                                Swelling of the R eyelid started 5 days post-vaccine.  Initially thought to be a Sty. First tried conventional warm compress multiple times a day.  That did not help.  Started to use Raw Honey and Hot Black Tea bags on eye, that brought the swelling to a head (pimple),  and started to drain at week 2.  Then the docs prescribed erythromycin opthamolgic ointment and I had an adverse reaction to that which increased the swelling again.  Now going on the 4th week, the swelling is still present and not showing any improvement.  Is it possible it&#39;s related to the vaccine??

                                                I experienced an unsettling metallic / bitter taste in my mouth about two days after vaccination. (It?s now lasted for six hours and counting).  I called an urgent care / telehealth line and am relieved to hear it?s not something to worry about unless it persists for a very long time - like 2 weeks. But I wanted to report the symptom here so that hopefully more people are aware that this is a possible side effect - and that it can appear well after vaccination day. It?s not listed on the handout I received. For what it?s worth,  I didn?t have this reaction to the first shot which is a little puzzling.  Anyway - hope this helps!

                                                Onset began with a flushing/warmth feeling in the right side of face about 35 minutes after injection, with itching on the roof of the mouth accompanied by feeling of swelling in the area. This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at about 4:05 or 4:10 PM today (Wed, Mar 3, 2021). Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

                                                He began to have some severe pain in his ears to the point of 8/10.  He went to the hospital, saw a doctor and they gave him some medication Amox/clav that he took.  He did not help the pain.  After 2 days he went back to the ER on 3/7/21, they gave him another antibiotic called Ofloxacin ear drops.   He found out that he had a hole in his ear drum.  He has never had an issue like this before, and he was fine when he got the vaccine and feels it&#39;s related to that.  He has had no problems other than the regular side effects which only lasted for 1 day and then went away.  Yesterday, 3/8/21 the problem shifted to the other ear.  He is beginning to feel pain on his left ear as well now.  He has terrible hearing loss due to this issue.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

Approximately 48-72 hours after injection, patient experienced left eye pain and developed a non-itch-inducing rash in left temple.  Following after this period, eye pain worsened, as did the size of rash (stretching from temple to back of left ear - along the V1 nerve).  Patient was diagnosed with Shingles and is now receiving treatment for that virus.  It is theorized that the vaccine induced an immune response to attack the novel virus, and left its guard down for the dormant Herpes Zoster virus.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0900 on 1/7/21. At around 0300 on 1/8/21, I woke up in the night due to a loud ringing inside my right ear. It was loud enough to keep me awake and the ringing has not stopped, even up until this point. I can still hear out of the right ear, but I cannot hear over the ringing. High pitch noises I can hear amplified, while it is difficult to hear anything else. I can also feel the vibrations in my inner ear during those high noises. I did take 800mg of Ibuprofen before bed and I know that NSAIDS can be associated with Tinnitus but this seems very out of the ordinary for me with no medical history and remarkable health screen.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

                                                No history of severe allergic reactions.  Observed for 15 minutes following vaccine injection.  Felt fine at that point so I was told that I could leave.  About 10-15 minutes after leaving (about 25-30 minutes after vaccine injection), I started to feel tingling in the bottom half of my face (most noticeable in the bottom lip and chin area), slight swelling on back sides of tongue, and slight swelling of area under chin at the top of the throat (right side only).  I could still breathe, drink, and talk normally.  Although symptoms did not seem to be intensifying, I decided to seek care at a nearby urgent care out of caution.  I arrived at the urgent care about 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms (about 45 minutes after vaccine injection).  Provider evaluated me, administered pepcid and a Benadryl shot, and notified me that if I went into anaphylactic shock that they would administer an epipen and call an ambulance.  Vitals were normal and remained normal throughout observation.  Symptoms began to abate about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Tongue swelling abated first about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Active tingling in the chin abated about 30 minutes after Benadryl injection, although light numbness remained.  Swelling under chin abated about 45 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Provider or staff checked on me every 15-20 minutes.  Provider released me from observation after about 2 hours.  At that point all symptoms had abated with the exception of slight numbness on bottom half of face, which persisted for several more hours.

                                                Per the patient&#39;s mother, after receiving the 2nd vaccine dose on 2/19/21, patient &#34;became different&#34;.  He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

On day 10, March 20, 2021, at approximately 5:00 pm, I lost all hearing in my right ear.  I was turned away as a possible ear infection, but due to the complete loss of hearing, I followed up on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.  After being seen by an ENT, I was diagnosed with Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in my Right ear.  I have started treatment with my first injection into the eardrum and am currently on day 3 of oral steroids (predniSONE - 20mg Tablets, 3x first 7 days, 2x days 8-9, 1x day 10).  No improvement or recovery as of yet, if at all.

Vascular surgeon, Hematologist who are treating me for a PE and DVT post ankle fracture and surgery do not correlate the SSHL with my DVT, PE, or anticoagulation.  To date 3 audiometry tests demonstrate persistent left-sided moderate high-frequency hearing loss.

                                                received the vaccine on 12/22/2020. Took a nap on 12/26/2020 around 1400 and woke up and noticed that left eye had blurry vision. He washed it and it was still blurry. After 1 hour, he decided to go to the ED- was worried about possible stroke in his eye or retinal detachment.  No retinal detachment found in ED; was discharged from the ED, not admitted into the hospital. Followed up with ophthalmologist as instructed on 12/27/2020.  Retinal scan done and found no retinal detachment but the doctor found fluid found behind the retina.  MD recommends rest, less stress at work.   Unknown if related to vaccine per MD - mentioned no data is available to compare.

I after a week I went to an ENT and then an audiologist. I have been put on a high dose of prednisone steroids (90 mg with a body weight of 200 lbs) now for three days. No improvement. The ringing is terrible, it is hard to sleep and concentrate. I now have to turn the volume up on tv and music to hear things that I could hear before.

She advised I go to urgent care. I went to urgent care and they checked my blood glucose levels, EKG to check my heart was beating correctly. Urgent care advised I go to ER to get further evaluation done. I went to ER where they evaluated me. Advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine and to monitor. The following day (Fri) still felt slight swelling/numbness. Symptoms became worse in the evening called nurse line to explain swelling on my lip and face. Advised to take benadryl then go to ER. I went to ER in another location.  ER Dr. advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.
