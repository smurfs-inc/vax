                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

COVID: the patient still had chest congestion, but no fever without medication, no cough anymore. He was having cough, fever, loss of taste and smell, fatigue and malaise. Reporter seriousness for COVID: Not serious. Relatedness of drug to reaction/event:  Reaction assessed: COVID, Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection, Drug result: Unrelated. Verbatim event relatedness: Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: COVID-Unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 30Dec2020.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the diagnosed COVID-19 likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use, and unrelated to BNT162B2.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

                                                This vaccine is extremely illegal. Terroristic. I have been having such an extreme headache. Bluryness, to the point where I have blindnesss. I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

He notes a fhx of heart problems and states that his dad had heart bypass surgery a couple years ago. Pt denies any daily medications other than vitamin gummies. Denies DVT risk factors or prior history of DVT.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

A 30-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant drug. The patient experienced recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid on 04Jan2021 00:30, mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage on 31Dec2020, loss of smell on 02Jan2021, exhaustion/feeling tired on 03Jan2021, felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe, he still has his sense of taste, but it is dulled on an unspecified date. He was a pharmacist. He received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on Thursday 31Dec2020 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he got the typical side effects of the vaccine that are posted. Then 2.5 days letter he no longer had a sense of smell. Everything he read said that he probably came in contact with COVID prior to administration. His questions was since he test positive for COVID, should he still get the second shot. He got it at a clinic. He did experience mild congestion which started by 6 o&#39;clock. He started to notice slight congestion that kind of went away. Then, on Friday, about 24 hours later, he really noticed he had congestion. He took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). Then his sense of smell diminished with the congestion and felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe. On Saturday, he decided to not take medication. That was when he noticed he could not smell anything. He had full blown congestion. It probably took two days when he started to lose his sense of smell. He received the shot on Thursday. On Saturday, he lost his sense of smell. He still has his sense of taste, but it was dulled. Sunday, he was just exhausted and feeling tired. These were all listed as typical side effects except for the loss of smell. Saturday was the worst. The congestion went into full nasal drainage. On Sunday he had no sinus issues. He still hasn&#39;t gained his sense of smell back. The exhaustion set in Sunday 03Jan2020. He doesn&#39;t feel like any of the side effects are serious. The exhaustion has started to let up some so it is improving. He was pretty much back to normal. He just couldn&#39;t figure out why he had a loss of smell. He had a COVID rapid test on 04Jan2021 at 8:30 am (as reported). He received an alert and hour later that it was positive. He was wondering whether the loss of smell could be from the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 rapid POC test: positive on 04Jan2021. The outcome of events for mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage was resolved on 03Jan2021, for loss of smell was not resolved, for exhaustion/feeling tired was resolving, for other events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported event &#34;recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid&#34; is considered possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known drug safety profile.

Current day a lot of pain in jaw neck throat face still only happening on left side of body more pain then before but less swelling neck still swollen a little bit. I tried cough drops soup heat ice and still having pain don?t want to pay for an ER visit found old painkillers haven?t taken yet. How long do symptoms like these last for ?

                                                As a person who has never had any kind of allergies--including seasonal allergies--as of the week I received the vaccine, I appear to have developed a new allergy to dust mites. When resting my head against a pillow (especially near the open end of the pillow case), I develop sneezing, complete sinus congestion (to the point I am not able to breathe from either nostril), runny eyes, and similar histamine responses. The symptoms have responded well to diphenhydramine and loratadine, as well as use of allergen-resistant pillowcases, but they have reduced my sleep quality in the weeks since they developed, and I feel this new allergy has negatively impacted my quality of life.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, depressed mood, brain fog, irritability, tinnitus, body temperature fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. No treatment was received for the events. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The event outcome was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded. However the clinical course, relevant medical history and concomitant medications are pending for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

EMAIL REPORT, &#34;I noticed when I got home yesterday while eating supper I could not TASTE anything. I was eating a really garlicy meal and I kept putting more garlic on it as I couldn?t figure out why I couldn?t taste it. I am still having the same problem today. I am sure it will go away, but you said to let you know of any symptoms.&#34;

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Started feeling very fatigued around 6/7 PM on 1/7/21. Ate dinner shortly after and took my normal sleeping pills as previously listed. Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

Pt states that this is sudden onset today. he is unsure if it is related to the recent covid vaccine but has otherwise been well. He has no recent viral sx. He has no other neuro sx. He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

                                                everything was muffled and he had constant ringing in the ears; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at single dose as his first dose, via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 06Jan2021 at single dose as his second dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. There included unspecified medications and stopped several of them a week ago on 05Jan2021. The patient was having a side effect that popped up out of the middle of nowhere, and he went through his meds, and he wanted to see if anyone else was having these issues. The patient was having ringing in both ears that happened late Dec2020, and in the beginning of Jan2021, and he had both rounds, he was an RN (registered nurse) at a hospital, and the ringing had gotten louder, and the only thing, medication, drug, that he took PO, over the counter, the only thing that correlates was it happened after both vaccines, later clarified as COVID vaccines. Right before the second dose, it was really really loud, and then he got the second dose, and over the last 1.5 weeks, the ringing has gotten worse in both ears, so he called his primary care, who referred him to ENT (ear, nose and throat), and he saw ENT, and to look in the ear, he said it was the nerve, he didn&#39;t know what triggered it in both ears, he said it was usually only in one ear if it&#39;s a viral thing, so it&#39;s uncommon in both ears, and the doctor asked if he was on medication, and the caller stopped several of them a week ago on 05Jan2021, that would cause it, but it had gotten worse. The patient didn&#39;t know etiology or how the vaccine worked, but he tested for COVID and it was negative, and his doctor was asking him if he experienced this any other time, told him to stop medications, and it&#39;s gotten worse, asked him if he was on any recreational drugs, he was on no new meds, he was a nurse, and works in ICU, and basically didn&#39;t know where it come from, but suddenly, everything was muffled and he had constant ringing in the ears. COVID test was about 2 weeks ago, the rapid was negative, then the PCR was negative. The outcome of event was recovering.

I am an otherwise healthy 32 y/o male with no relevant PMH and never with tinnitus prior to this. It continues to persist for 2 days. No other relevant sx to report. Seemed worthy of reporting given the likely timing of my peak antibody response at the 14d mark and general vaccine monitoring concerns of cross reactive antibody responses.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I have some mild tinnitus which I&#39;ve had for 15 years since high school and rarely bothers me. Go months without noticing it.   A few hours after my first dose of Pfizer (left arm), I got a headache and some queasiness. The expected side effects. My ears started ringing louder and more pronounced, which I assumed was a side-effect of the headache and/or immune response to the vaccine. It&#39;s past two weeks now since dose 1 and my ears are still ringing much more loudly and noticeably than in the last 15 or so years. All other side effects have long ago subsided. It seems to be worse in left ear, the same side I got shot on. I imagine that&#39;s irrelevant, but mentioning it anyway here.   Distracting and distressing.  Am scheduled for a second dose on April 21 and now hesitant about getting it.

I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

On 1/14 the right half of my lower lip swelled up and would continue to do so until 1/15 around about 0730 after taking a benadryl.   Symptoms and issues seem to happen sporadically without a pattern or warning.

So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen.

Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

The last occurrence was about a year prior to this current event. I?m not entirely sure it is related to the vaccine, however my right eye swelled shut over night. I have no other adverse events. Today, I have taken OTC allergy medication, allergy eye drops, Benadryl, Pepcid, and Ibuprofen.  The swelling is now going down.

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

It was so bad it was hard for me to walk. Slept for most of day after shot. I was extremely fatigued and all I could do is sleep. Some very minor visual disturbances (trying to focus my eyes). Slight altered level of consciousness when body chills hit.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

It was loud enough to keep me awake and the ringing has not stopped, even up until this point. I can still hear out of the right ear, but I cannot hear over the ringing. High pitch noises I can hear amplified, while it is difficult to hear anything else. I can also feel the vibrations in my inner ear during those high noises. I did take 800mg of Ibuprofen before bed and I know that NSAIDS can be associated with Tinnitus but this seems very out of the ordinary for me with no medical history and remarkable health screen.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

                                                Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 at 15:15 hours.  A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

                                                No history of severe allergic reactions.  Observed for 15 minutes following vaccine injection.  Felt fine at that point so I was told that I could leave.  About 10-15 minutes after leaving (about 25-30 minutes after vaccine injection), I started to feel tingling in the bottom half of my face (most noticeable in the bottom lip and chin area), slight swelling on back sides of tongue, and slight swelling of area under chin at the top of the throat (right side only).  I could still breathe, drink, and talk normally.  Although symptoms did not seem to be intensifying, I decided to seek care at a nearby urgent care out of caution.  I arrived at the urgent care about 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms (about 45 minutes after vaccine injection).  Provider evaluated me, administered pepcid and a Benadryl shot, and notified me that if I went into anaphylactic shock that they would administer an epipen and call an ambulance.  Vitals were normal and remained normal throughout observation.  Symptoms began to abate about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Tongue swelling abated first about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Active tingling in the chin abated about 30 minutes after Benadryl injection, although light numbness remained.  Swelling under chin abated about 45 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Provider or staff checked on me every 15-20 minutes.  Provider released me from observation after about 2 hours.  At that point all symptoms had abated with the exception of slight numbness on bottom half of face, which persisted for several more hours.

He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

On day 10, March 20, 2021, at approximately 5:00 pm, I lost all hearing in my right ear.  I was turned away as a possible ear infection, but due to the complete loss of hearing, I followed up on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.  After being seen by an ENT, I was diagnosed with Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in my Right ear.  I have started treatment with my first injection into the eardrum and am currently on day 3 of oral steroids (predniSONE - 20mg Tablets, 3x first 7 days, 2x days 8-9, 1x day 10).  No improvement or recovery as of yet, if at all.

Received Pfizer vaccine from work on 12/21/20 L arm IM, no side effects, sore arm for &lt; 24 hours, second dose 1/11/21 L arm IM, no side effects, sore arm for &lt; 24, however, on 1/22/21 work up with muffled hearing and bringing in the left ear only.  Called colleague Doctor who started prednisone 50 mg immediately on 1/23/21 and continued for 4 weeks without improvement.  Audiometry testing 1/25/21 demonstrated moderate high-frequency hearing loss suggestive of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL).  Emergent CT head and MRI brain and ear were unrevealing.  20 session of hyperbaric oxygen therapy from 1/21-2/21 without substantial improvement.  Vasculitis workup negative with normal ANA, CRP, ESR, ANCA, CBC, CMP.   3/21 COVID-19 antibodies test for exposure negative.  4/21 noting more public event reporting of hearing loss and tinnitus associated with vaccines. reports-grow-amid-covid-19-vaccinations/) while I understand there is not causal evidence yet linked, I feel that there is a temporal relationship and odd correlation that needs to be recorded and accounted prospectively further.  Vascular surgeon, Hematologist who are treating me for a PE and DVT post ankle fracture and surgery do not correlate the SSHL with my DVT, PE, or anticoagulation.  To date 3 audiometry tests demonstrate persistent left-sided moderate high-frequency hearing loss.

He washed it and it was still blurry. After 1 hour, he decided to go to the ED- was worried about possible stroke in his eye or retinal detachment.  No retinal detachment found in ED; was discharged from the ED, not admitted into the hospital. Followed up with ophthalmologist as instructed on 12/27/2020.  Retinal scan done and found no retinal detachment but the doctor found fluid found behind the retina.  MD recommends rest, less stress at work.   Unknown if related to vaccine per MD - mentioned no data is available to compare.

                                                I got tinnitus in both ears about 24 hours after second injection. High pitched ringing constant. I after a week I went to an ENT and then an audiologist. I have been put on a high dose of prednisone steroids (90 mg with a body weight of 200 lbs) now for three days. No improvement. The ringing is terrible, it is hard to sleep and concentrate. I now have to turn the volume up on tv and music to hear things that I could hear before.
