                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

                                                After receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I was experiencing headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, and nausea. The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

                                                Patient presented with puffy eyes approximately 4 minutes after vaccination. Was alert and oriented to time, person, and place upon questioning and was able to engage in conversation. Parent (mother) of patient was present who gave patient&#39;s medical history and reported allergy to grass with similar reaction.  Blood pressure was taken and found to be 150/80. Mother reported patient had not taken his blood pressure medicine yet that day but his normal is 115/70 with  medication. While nurse was assessing patient&#39;s pulse (patient&#39;s pulse was WNL at 85) and other nursing staff was obtaining medication to administer if needed after assessment, patient became unresponsive to verbal commands and his upper body became limp. At 1054, a one time, single dose of 50 mg of diphenhydramine IM was given in the left deltoid. On site EMT arrived on the scene at 1055, completed assessment, and confirmed giving diphenhydramine was the best course of action. At this time, 1055, patient became responsive to verbal commands and was oriented to time, place, and person. At 1056 O2 sat was at 97%, pulse 70, and at 1100, BP was 110/70. Patient stayed for observation 30 more minutes and remained stable. Patient and parent were educated on side effects of diphenhydramine, to watch for any returning symptoms of allergic reaction throughout the day, and if/when to head to the ER. Recommended patient not receive 2nd dose of COVID vaccination.

                                                I took notes during my wait time: -6 minutes in my throat felt weird, but different than normal allergic reactions to foods. I prepared my Epi-Pen so I have easier access at this time. -9 minutes in the sides of my tongue were slightly itchy. -11 minutes in and I felt as though the saliva in the back of my throat was thicker and I needed to clear my throat a bit more often, similar to allergic reactions. -15 minutes in, I felt my heart pound once out of beat, but my heart rhythm returned to normal immediately. Tongue itchiness also became intermittent rather than constant. -18 minutes in, overall condition improved and I felt better. -22 minutes in, my throat felt scratchy like I would if I consumed legumes (chickpeas, green peas, soy beans, etc.) but also oddly warm, which was out of the norm.  No treatments needed given mild reactions. I went to work, but notified my co-workers of my reaction, so if my condition worsens they can help administer my Epi-Pen. I am reporting this at 9:21 am on 03/05/2021, roughly an hour after my first dose.

                                                Woke at 3:50am. Right ear felt as though it very much needed to pop; internal pressure beyond external areas where finger can access. Hearing very much muffled. Not tinnitus (no ringing, screeching, etc.), which I have had before (in this ear), or if it were tinnitus then a very different tinnitus. Ear not significantly different by current time, 11:10am.   Though no scientific background to connect ear issue to vaccine received around 40 hours prior, no other changes in habit or precursors.

                                                This was my second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. I took some notes during my waiting time following my injection similar to my first dose. Information from my last report can be found using Temporary VAERS E-Report No: 334845. Of note, I did prepare for my second dose by taking Benadryl 50 mg and Airborne Immune-Boost supplements the night before my second dose, so my symptoms were not as severe as last time.  6 minutes: Mild tingling around tongue. This time all around the edges of my tongue, but a lot less bothersome than the first dose. 8 minutes: Weird. Slight itchiness under left half of tongue. Still very mild but less concerning than first dose itchiness on the left and right sides of my tongue. 18 minutes: Itchy on right side slightly, only side noticeable. 20 minutes: Mild warm feeling on left side of top of my throat. Less bothersome than time. 26 minutes: Left throat warm ness resolved, but transitioned to right side of top of my throat. 31 minute: Throat warmness overall resolved, but slightly itchy on edge of right side of my tongue. 37 minutes: Top of throat on right feels weird but not itchy. Warm maybe? 39 minutes: Weird feeling on right side of throat resolved.  Symptoms more or less resolved the rest of the day, especially after second dose of Flonase @ 9:00 am.  14 hours later: About to go to bed. Feeling fatigued, similar to my first dose after working out. Took airborne and two Benadryl (25 mg each) before sleeping.  24 hours later: 03/27/2021, feeling more fatigued, groggy, mild headache (mostly at back of my head), and muscle aches around my body.  25 hours later: Groggy feeling and fatigue resolved. Possibly due to Benadryl or vaccine?  32 hours later: Majority of muscle aches resolved. Headache also resolved. Feeling mostly soreness at this point.  Drank Airborne @ 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. In between drank plenty of fluids (water, cranberry juice, apple juice, milk). No fever or chills.

I cannot blink fully with the left eye, and I cannot contract my left cheek fully. My smile is asymmetric and I cannot fully lift my left eyebrow. The loss of taste on left side of the tongue persists as of today 04/08. I was prescribed prednisone 20mg twice daily by my primary physician, which I started yesterday, 04/07. No alleviation of symptoms so far.

Denied history of this happening after vaccination. Patient denied any difficulty breathing or swelling of throat/tongue. RPH check bp and it was 95/55, pulse 80. Patient stated he  was at clinic yesterday and was told his bp was on the lower end of normal. Reported feeling a bit nauseous also. We gave him a bag in case he got sick and a small bottle of water. He was able to stand up and walk to a chair to sit down. We asked if he wanted us to call someone and he declined and said he was feeling better. We asked him to stay for 30 minutes more so we could monitor. After 30 minutes he reported the nausea had passed and he  was feeling normal again. He said he was ok to drive home.

A 26-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (reported as &#34;this afternoon&#34;) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at 26-year-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as no. Concomitant medications were not reported. Couple minutes into that he got light headed, his vision got blurred and then he had a complete vision loss. They cleared the room and called the paramedics. The paramedics came and said that both of his eyes were dilated and his blood pressure was high. They sat him for couple of minutes, then his vision return. So if they ask them make the total of vision loss lasted for seven minutes. His blood pressure went down. They kept him there and had a given a bottle of water and two container of fruit juice to bring his sugar level up. They made sure everything seems alright. And paramedics left and said that they thought it would be cause from some sort of blood reaction and allergic reaction to vaccine. And told them not to get the second shot. And let us want to he felt ok that it would be alright to go home. They did keep him there for about half an hour longer just to make sure he was alright and then sent him home. That was just a reaction and he should be ok now. No treatment received. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unspecified date. Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

Medical history included non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, allergies, asthma, autism, sensory integration disorder, appendectomy, pilonidal cyst removal, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took penicilline, tetracycline, amoxillin [amoxicillin sodium] and hydrocodone.  The patient experienced dizziness/vertigo within a couple of hours of first vaccine on 20Apr2021. Developed ringing in right ear (tinnitus) on same day. By 21Apr2021, right ear began to feel full with pressure/pain. All symptoms continued with swelling of lymph nodes and loss of hearing in right ear by 22Apr2021. The events were assessed as serious, disabling. The patient saw otolaryngologist (ENT) for hearing test and evaluation on 27Apr2021, hearing test showed substantial loss of hearing in right ear. Steroids were prescribed and taken. The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): unknown results on an unspecified date. Dizziness/vertigo either resolved on 29Apr2021. The patient outcome of the other events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 26-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 11May2021 at the age of 26 years old (Batch/Lot Number: EW0176, Expiration date: unknown) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) administered in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at the age of 26 years old (Batch/Lot number: EW0171, Expiration date: unknown) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced dizziness/vertigo within a couple of hours on 20Apr2021; tinnitus (ringing in right ear) on same day; and right ear began to feel full with pressure/pain by 21Apr2021 in the morning (am), which all continued with swelling of lymph nodes and loss of hearing in right ear by 22Apr2021. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the pharmacy or drug store. Relevant medical history included non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, asthma, autism, appendectomy, pilonidal cyst removal, sensory integration disorder, allergies, allergy to Penicillin, and allergy to all Sulfa medications and all Cephalosporins; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) and montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took tetracycline, amoxicillin sodium (AMOXILLIN), and hydrocodone and experienced allergy from these drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 11May2021, the patient received the second dose of Pfizer vaccine and within minutes tinnitus decibel increased substantially in right ear and developed in left ear. Tinnitus stopped in left ear and lowered to decibel level he has had since first shot in right ear. The patient was diagnosed with sudden onset of hearing loss in right ear on an unspecified date and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no tumour. All symptoms were ongoing with no prognosis of resolution. Both the events resulted in disability. The adverse events did result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient underwent further lab tests and procedures, which included a second hearing test with unknown results on an unspecified date. The patient received treatment for the adverse events, which included a prescription for steroid pack. The patient was not recovered from both the events.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

A 27-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid on 21Dec2020 13:45 at single dose for Vaccination.  There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  The patient was diagnosed with covid on 30Dec2020 with outcome of recovering.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test: positive on 30Dec2020. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with covid on 30Dec2020. The patient had COVID test on 30Dec2020 and received positive result of COVID test on 31Dec2020. He was scheduled for the second dose between 08Jan2021 and 11Jan2021. He asked if he should continue to get the second dose as scheduled in relation to the diagnosis of COVID. COVID: the patient still had chest congestion, but no fever without medication, no cough anymore. He was having cough, fever, loss of taste and smell, fatigue and malaise. Reporter seriousness for COVID: Not serious. Relatedness of drug to reaction/event:  Reaction assessed: COVID, Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection, Drug result: Unrelated. Verbatim event relatedness: Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: COVID-Unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 30Dec2020.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the diagnosed COVID-19 likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use, and unrelated to BNT162B2.

The following day I started having feverish feelings, runny nose, continued cough, slight sore throat, fatigue. The day after that, Jan 17th, I had all the previous listed symptoms as well as loss of taste and some loss of smell. On Monday, Jan 18th, I had all the previous listed symptoms without any feverish feelings. I did have more fatigue and confusion, and I also had increased hunger for food. Today, Tuesday, Jan 19th, I took a rapid test for COVID 19 and tested positive. Today I am experiencing fatigue, slight amount of confusion, slightly sore throat.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

                                                Pt. was vaccinated by another pharmacist at our remote clinic at an elementary school at 11:35am 3/11/21. Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

He was taken to a private section of the arena and monitored. His heart rate was initially in the 40s and systolic BP  in the 70s, and subsequent monitoring should resolution of his bradycardia and hypotension.    25 minutes of monitoring, his symptoms have completely resolved. He has a history of similar symptoms with IM iniections.

                                                I&#39;ve been experiencing mild, but consistent adverse side effects to the vaccine. This vaccine. Is completely Terroristic. This vaccine is a biological warfare. I&#39;ve been very active in obtaining vaccinations. Flu shots, up to date with tetanus, and obtaining a second Immunization for chicken pox because I actually received the chicken, but had no vaccination. And. I need the vaccination record for school. So I had to get the chicken pox vaccine.  I&#39;ve been having mild, but very uncomfortable and consistent headaches. My sinuses all over my face are so filled. My eyes are watery, turn red, and at time so painful that it&#39;s difficult to open them. I have muscle weakness. I&#39;m always so thirty all the time. My urine smells  like uric acid. Has a rancid toxic smell to it. And. My urine is clear. But smells. My skin feels silky. And. the perspiration from my body, smells like formaldehyde. Smells clean, but smells like toxic formaldehyde and dead sticky body residue.  The most uncomfortable is the partial blindness. Headaches. Muscle aches. Joint aches. Neck pains. Eye pains. The consistent thirst.  I can&#39;t go to the doctor because I don&#39;t have insure. But. Most importantly. I don&#39;t have employment, because of the Government&#39;s illegal employment system that accounts for me. I&#39;ve been unemployed for 6 years. And. Have a private college degree from one of the top Universities in the USA.  Also. I&#39;ve been very active in producing sputum. Flem. My neck is swollen. And parts of my body are swollen. Not severely. But you can see there is minor swelling.  All the symptoms I&#39;m disclosing in this report, are minor. But. When collectively experienced. Is unbarable. Extremely Uncomfortable. And. You&#39;re expecting me to get another dosage of this experience. Being. 2 months incapacitated. This is even illegally distributed. What the hell. In God&#39;s name. Are you people in there doing. And. Why are you people in the Government even able to get away with this.

Pt got up and went to waiting area and  was sitting down in chair during the 15 minute observation window. Pt passed out and slumped/fell out of chair on patients left side. I was called out by the person monitoring the waiting area to see pt in fetal position on their left side seizing. The seizing lasted for about 15 seconds and then stopped. PT was motionless for a few more seconds and then came around and said &#34;I&#39;m back&#34;.  The pt was given a bottle of water because he said he was thirsty. In the meantime the paramedics were called and arrived. They checked his BP and Blood Glucose. After several minutes they took the pt out on a gurney for further evaluation, there was a question as to whether or not pt hit his head.

                                                This vaccine is extremely illegal. Terroristic. I have been having such an extreme headache. Bluryness, to the point where I have blindnesss. I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

Patient hit chin and did lacerate it; this was attended to by NP who was administering shots at the time. Patient mentioned that he &#34;tasted like he threw up,&#34; was instructed to drink water. NP took vitals and patient showed no sign of concussion. In the mean time patient was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to come pick him up. Still felt lightheaded 15 minutes after being attended to, at this time we called the squad. Before the squad could show up patients brother came to pick him up... was whisked away too quickly for us to stop him. Patient was adamant about us not calling squad because he does not have insurance.

                                                After eating lunch approx. 24 hours after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, I began to cough suddenly. I then got itchy eyes, had some wheezing, and sneezed/got a runny nose. About a half hour after getting these symptoms, I took 10mg of children?s Benadryl (Diphenhydramine). I then found two hives/itchy bumps. One on my right arm near my elbow and one on the left side of my abdomen. About 20 minutes after taking the Benadryl, the symptoms mostly went away and I felt very tired. I still have some wheezing.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Apr2021 at 14:30 as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 27 years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included coarctation of the aorta from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing coarctation of aorta (age: 3 months), only requires bi-annual cardiologist visits, loss of consciousness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. The patient had no know allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed on 16Apr2021 at 14:30. Circulation issues leading to a black out. Within 60 seconds of getting the shot, he began to feel light-headed. Within 30 seconds of that, he knew he needed help, so alerted the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) via car horn/flashers. By the time they arrived (120 seconds from the initial shot), he lost his vision and hearing and was essentially unresponsive. They woke him enough to unlock my car door, at which point they had him lay back to improve his circulation. That ultimately worked and got him back to normal within about 5 minutes. The patient had issues like this before relating to a coarctation of his aorta which he had done at 3 months of age. Over the years, he has &#34;blacked out&#34; like this from weight lifting and other high exertion things. This was the first time it was induced without him overexerting himself, and the onset of the &#34;blackout&#34; was much quicker than what he had experienced from weightlifting. Normally, he could tell 1-3 minutes in advance that he would black out. This time, it was about 30 seconds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lost vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and feel light-headed. EMTs did an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood glucose check. The outcome of lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Patient reported chest pain for 2 days and intermittent jaw pain after receiving his second Pfizer COVID vaccine on 4/22, and presented to the ER on 4/25 with a headache and emesis. An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

                                                After about an hour following my second COVID-19 Injection I began feeling warm.  My forehead felt warmer so I figure I may have had a slight fever at that point.  I received a metallic (Note I say metallic but I know it wasn&#39;t actually metal but that&#39;s simply the best way I can describe the taste I experienced) following the injection about 5 minutes after.  My arm remained sore following and still remains sore as of this report.  I experienced a decline in mental acuity following about an hour after injection.  I began to feel lightheaded and exhausted to the point I was experiencing severe disorientation and confusion.  I was having trouble putting sentences together and experienced a ringing sensation in the ears.  I felt like I wasn&#39;t even present anymore.  I couldn&#39;t comprehend things around me and apparently had conversations I don&#39;t even remember having.  Note that at that point I had gotten home but don&#39;t even remember getting home.  I just know that this did not begin to wear off until around 8:45pm  when it was like someone flipped a switch and I suddenly was coherent again.  It was an odd sensation to experience.  The arm remained sore and the metallic taste returned briefly after this experience.  I experienced a similar feeling from the HPV injection years ago, but just like this it was a temporary thing that resulted in no long term issues.  However, I cannot tell you fully what we did the rest of the day until around 845-9 pm.  I also remember becoming partly agitated after the injection like my body just all of a sudden took notice of something and shot into action.  I had received my allergy injections this same day about two hours earlier as well and none of these reactions ever occur with those for me.  I continued to drink liquid as far as I know as there were a few empty bottles of water next to me.  I have no recollection of getting them.  It&#39;s odd.  There&#39;s just this brief moment in time that is just missing from my memory with a few short bits and pieces that are there like a puzzle with some missing pieces.  I feel I became so fatigued I could not function.  My emotions I remember were off and hard to control during this period too.  I felt like I was having some random mood swings.  I feel ok now though aside from the upset stomach occasionally and the fatigue and arm pain (but even the arm pain has partly decreased now).  It all ceased.  I have a number of health issues outside of this but have not experienced this long of a period of almost intermittent amnesia and incoherency following an injection before.  I believe it made me that much more tired or reacted with one of my many conditions or genetic variants that perhaps may have been part of this.  I&#39;m happy to provide anything I can to help with this.  I am greatly appreciative of all the CDC has done to get us this vaccine and continues to do to ensure our safety both before and after injection.  It is commendable.    I did fill out my survey through the V-Safe portal as well and will continue to follow up there should I have any changes.  I have not sought medical care following this event as the coherency and such have seemed to resolve in regards to the vaccine injection.  Only thing left are known side effects at this point besides an occasional increase in numbness and tingling that I already experience in my legs and feet.  My absolute best guess for the cause is my immune system which already has some issues regulating (doesn&#39;t always like to learn everything it should and we are currently searching for an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder currently going on as well in me) on top of allergy shots today.  it was perhaps just a bit too much demand on it all at once.  But it seems to be balancing out again now.

After 5-6 minutes he notes a syncopal episode that he describes as feeling like he randomly fell asleep. When this occurred, he fell back in his chair and hit his head. He notes blurry vision after this occurred but felt like he was slowly improving. While he was being brought to the ED in a wheelchair he began experiencing blurry vision again and his face became very pale. He was given some apple juice and reports that after 5-10 minutes he felt back to normal. While his vitals were being taken, his HR and BP were very low and he experienced another episode. Pt does not have a hx of passing out 2/2 needles and notes that he gets a flu shot every year and is totally fine. He does note that he became queasy when he tried to give blood in the past but that this does not normally happen. Of note, pt denies any leg swelling prior to these episodes. Pt endorses a low baseline HR in the 50s per his Fitbit but otherwise denies any known heart problems. He notes a fhx of heart problems and states that his dad had heart bypass surgery a couple years ago. Pt denies any daily medications other than vitamin gummies. Denies DVT risk factors or prior history of DVT.

                                                Received  the vaccine at 10:;15 am on 4/14/2021 and had fatigue, slight chills, and a sore arm.  By 4/16/2021 I felt normal until approx. 10pm when my right ear blocked up and I lost hearing in my right ear.  On 4/17/2021 I treated it as a congestion issue with neti pot and decongestions but the ear remained blocked.  After sleeping for approx 1 hour on 4/17/2021 I woke up at approx. 11pm with severe vertigo and nausea and vomited consistently for approx 1 hour.  I could not get off of the floor and the right side of my face was fixated to the floor.  Paramedics were called and I was taken to the ER where I was treated with anti-nausea medications and valium to reduce vertigo.  A non contrast CT, blood panel, and stroke assessment were all normal with no sign of ear infection.  I was release from the hospital at 10am on 4/19/2021.    On 4/21/2021 I saw an ENT who performed a hearing exam revealing my right ear is completely deaf with normal left ear function.  The ENT prescribed prednisone 10mg (63 tablets over 10 days).   As of today (4/25/2021) I no longer have vertigo and nausea, but I still have no hearing in my right ear and have significant vestibular challenges and cannot walk safely unassisted without getting dizzy.

                                                ~18 hours after receiving the vaccine I work up with very severe tinnitus in the morning. I had 3 fans in my room for white noise and it was still so bad I could not fall asleep again.  This lasted for about 4 hours and and slowly went away. As i&#39;m writing this it has been ~27 hours since my 2nd dose. Hopefully it does not come back again.   I&#39;ve selected permanent damage below since I read online there is no cure for tinnitus. But there&#39;s not been enough time that has passed to determine if this is a one off occasion or I may experience this effect for life.

A 28-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 at 28 years old (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated that on 19Apr, he had the first shot of pfizer covid vaccine. This past sunday (25Apr2021), he had an episode which he stated was similar to a TIA (transient ischemic attack). Reported numbness, pain and tightness in his lower half of his body which was more prominently felt on his left side.

He also reported having shortness of breath, headache, feeling foggy, balance issue, coordination off, having a hard time to get a sentence out (felt like his motor skills were affected), confusion, blurred vision and an impending sense of doom. Stated this episode persisted for 15 min and then it resolved. Currently he was experiencing a &#39;post fatigue&#39; and his energy didn&#39;t feel up to par. Reported experiencing something similar last may except for &#39;the paralysis&#39;. Had not followed up with his provider. Patient was scheduled for second shot of Pfizer covid vaccine on 10May, he was asking for information if he decided to delay his second shot past may 10th. He was asking for information on getting the second shot given his recent experience possibly related to the vaccine shot. Was not sure if he should get the second shot. He was asking about side effects for the second shot- if it would be worse. Asking if there were any reports of blood clots with Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;post fatigue&#39; and &#34;his energy didn&#39;t feel up to par&#34; was unknown, of other events was recovered on 25Apr2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Cognitive -- severe symptoms began ~3 days after Pfizer 2nd dose.  Extreme disorientation and confusion (transient), memory loss (longterm), extreme lethargy - unable to move, intermittant psychosis (mild, esp. when going to sleep), and anxiety (transient but very extreme, unlike anything I&#39;ve felt before, not improved by diazepam)  (continued for 10 days then began to improve dramatically followed by alternating relapse on a daily basis for 4 weeks, up to present -- dramatically and stably improved by steroid treatment, returned after discontinuing)   Nerve pain --  began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. -- tingling, burning throughout extremities, especially fingertips, toes, hips; transient (usually 5 seconds or less). Progressively became more frequent (20&#43; / day), longer lasting (up to 20 seconds) and more severe (like stabbing or electric shock). Gradually resolved after course of dexamethasone beginning 3 weeks after vaccination.   Sharp inner ear pain -- (both ears) began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. Rare events (~5x / day), very transient (1-2 seconds) but extremely painful. Continues up to present,  (4 weeks after Pfizer second dose). Also constant popping of both ears beginning week 2 to present, feels like fluid inside.   Adenopathy -- On 4/28/21 noticed massive swelling on left pectoral muscle (contralateral to vaccine injection site), diagnosed as lymphadenopathy, moderately painful. Continued to get worse for 1 week, began dexamethasone on 5/7/21. Dramatically improved, however swelling returned after discontinuing steroid and spread to all lymph nodes, including neck and others. Became extremely painful on 5/14/21, unable to walk due to swelling in inguinal lymph nodes.  Again dramatically improved after steroid injection on 5/16/21.

On day 5, I noticed unilateral lymphedema of my tonsils. On day 7, I went to an Urgent Care but didn&#39;t get much treatment. My condition worsened, I was fatigued, no appetite and thirsty. On day 8, I popped a fever of 103. On day 9, it worsened to the point that it was hard to breathe. I went to the ER on 10 and had a full array of tests. I was treated with dexamethasone and a bolus saline IV. My symptoms went away after treatment around day 14, but the lymphedema lingered for awhile longer.

                                                28 year old male presented for initial dose of Phizer-BioNtech at 1100 AM on 6/3/21.  Pre-assessment form was filled out and reviewed with nursing student administering the vaccine. The client stated no known allergies to medications, food, venom, or environmental elements. He also stated no allergic reactions to previous vaccines. The client also stated that he had no known health issues. After administration the patient stated he was dizzy and then immediately became unresponsive, diaphoretic, eyes rolled back, and head hyperextended. Family was present and we asked if he had any seizure history and his family declined. At this time the patient and family informed us that after vaccines in the past he does faint but didn&#39;t inform staff before this vaccine was administered. The patient remained unresponsive for 45 seconds. Then his feet were elevated and he asked to lay down. At 11:11 AM his HR was 60 and O2 was 97% on pulse oximetry. He felt hot and was still diaphoretic and felt very fatigued. Once he started feeling better we sat him back up and his HR was 89 and O2 was 99%. We gave him  2 bottles of water and crackers. He remained in our care for 45 minutes. He then waited an additional 30 minutes in the post vaccine area. His family stated they were going to drive him home and get some food.  The patient is expected to return June 24, 2021 for his second dose of the Phizer vaccine. We provided additional discharge instructions

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

Afterwards, I was lethargic for the evening and the next day. I also have a history sith similar reactions to giving blood and other similar instances.

                                                A couple days after my shot I started to develop a loud ringing in my ears, about five or six times a day. The volume of the ringing has decreased, but now it&#39;s a constant low ANNOYING hum.  It&#39;s been about three weeks, and I&#39;m very worried about getting my second shot now, there was a HUGE forum about people who have had this reaction and had the second shot aggrevate it further.  https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/tinnitus-reports-grow-amid-covid-19-vaccinations/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Vaccine%20Adverse%20Event,(loss%20of%20hearing%20acuity).

No post side effects until the first shot. I am taking allergy medicine, pill and nasal spray.  I didn?t lose my taste but things started to smell and taste so awful that I almost threw up on multiple occasions (Parosmia?). I?m not the easily queasy.  Things are almost back to normal with taste and  small working better. Caffeine and water most days. I also have G6PD if that matters.

                                                The first day I got the vaccine, my arm became very sore about 4 hours afterward. It kept getting more sore until I fell asleep. I stretched and massaged it.  The next day (Sunday), I woke up to a small canker sore in the left side of my mouth behind my top lip. It is right by where my canine and lateral incisor intersect. I thought nothing of it since I do occasionally get canker sores. As the day went on, the pain increased. I also noticed that two more sores had appeared. One on my lower lip right below where the original one is, and on my gums near my throat, like right where the gums end and throat begins. All on the left side. I got the shot in the left arm.  They&#39;re all more painful than usual, but the first one is the worst and is the biggest one I&#39;ve ever had. Normally if I get one (like once every other month) the canker sore is small, white, and hurts if I touch it. The one behind my top lip is causing my lip to be noticeably swollen when I open my mouth, and it&#39;s definitely left a crater. I can&#39;t brush my teeth near where it is because it feels like I&#39;m ripping out my flesh.  In addition, a submandibular node feels weird. It&#39;s not quite painful, but it&#39;s definitely a weird sensation that is noticeable at all times. I started feeling it one day after the vaccine, and today (two days after) the feeling is much more pronounced.  I have not seen a doctor since it seems like others have had these side effects, and they went away after a couple days. I just wanted to provide more data since it&#39;s definitely not the most comfortable thing right now.

Age at vaccination was 30-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS). The patient just wanted to know how long a low grade fever is in the patients, it&#39;s been like three days now she still has low grade fever, mouth sore, sore throat and she is still so weak. The patient was treated with Tylenol. Outcome was not recovered.   The reporting nurse considered the events related to the vaccine because the events started after that.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

A 30-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant drug. The patient experienced recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid on 04Jan2021 00:30, mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage on 31Dec2020, loss of smell on 02Jan2021, exhaustion/feeling tired on 03Jan2021, felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe, he still has his sense of taste, but it is dulled on an unspecified date. He was a pharmacist. He received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on Thursday 31Dec2020 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he got the typical side effects of the vaccine that are posted. Then 2.5 days letter he no longer had a sense of smell. Everything he read said that he probably came in contact with COVID prior to administration. His questions was since he test positive for COVID, should he still get the second shot. He got it at a clinic. He did experience mild congestion which started by 6 o&#39;clock. He started to notice slight congestion that kind of went away. Then, on Friday, about 24 hours later, he really noticed he had congestion. He took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). Then his sense of smell diminished with the congestion and felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe. On Saturday, he decided to not take medication. That was when he noticed he could not smell anything. He had full blown congestion. It probably took two days when he started to lose his sense of smell. He received the shot on Thursday. On Saturday, he lost his sense of smell. He still has his sense of taste, but it was dulled. Sunday, he was just exhausted and feeling tired. These were all listed as typical side effects except for the loss of smell. Saturday was the worst. The congestion went into full nasal drainage. On Sunday he had no sinus issues. He still hasn&#39;t gained his sense of smell back. The exhaustion set in Sunday 03Jan2020. He doesn&#39;t feel like any of the side effects are serious. The exhaustion has started to let up some so it is improving. He was pretty much back to normal. He just couldn&#39;t figure out why he had a loss of smell. He had a COVID rapid test on 04Jan2021 at 8:30 am (as reported). He received an alert and hour later that it was positive. He was wondering whether the loss of smell could be from the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 rapid POC test: positive on 04Jan2021. The outcome of events for mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage was resolved on 03Jan2021, for loss of smell was not resolved, for exhaustion/feeling tired was resolving, for other events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported event &#34;recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid&#34; is considered possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known drug safety profile.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Feb2021 at 07:00 (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not have any relevant medical history. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient had no symptoms until 5 days post vaccination. On 13Feb2021 at 12:15, the patient experienced fainting episode, loss of hearing, left collar-bone lymph node enlarged (noticeable swelling to area and left lower neck near carotid artery/lymph nodes), soreness in area, cold sweats, and light-headedness. The events required a visit to the physician&#39;s office and emergency room (as reported).  The clinical outcomes of the fainting episode, loss of hearing, left collar-bone lymph node enlarged, soreness in area, cold sweats, and light-headedness were unknown.    The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

I am still experiencing ringing in the ears and have since made an appointment with my ENT to determine if there are any other possible issues. I never had ringing in the ears prior to the  vaccine.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

I also couldn&#39;t focus and I was experiencing vision problems meaning I had trouble seeing. All these problems I wasn&#39;t experiencing any of them before the ??.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

                                                As a person who has never had any kind of allergies--including seasonal allergies--as of the week I received the vaccine, I appear to have developed a new allergy to dust mites. When resting my head against a pillow (especially near the open end of the pillow case), I develop sneezing, complete sinus congestion (to the point I am not able to breathe from either nostril), runny eyes, and similar histamine responses. The symptoms have responded well to diphenhydramine and loratadine, as well as use of allergen-resistant pillowcases, but they have reduced my sleep quality in the weeks since they developed, and I feel this new allergy has negatively impacted my quality of life.

I started to have headaches, body aches, chills, feverish feelings, frequent bowel movements, sleepiness, fatigue, and ringing in my ears. It&#39;s been 10 days now and my symptoms continue. I went to an urgent care on 4/4/21. Dr said it was the vaccine working. 4/8/21 I went to urgent care again. Dr said it was very strange that my symptoms continued. Took covid test and was negative. 4/8/21 night I decided to go to the hospital because the symptoms were not getting any better. ER Dr ran tests - X ray, urine test, blood work. Everything came back normal. Dr said my immune system was in overdrive.

                                                Mouth was dry right after injection, but water seems to help. Small white spots developed inside my mouth along my cheeks and lips a couple of hours later. The spots do not itch or bother me too much but they feel like I chewed on my lip. More of an annoyance than anything. I did not go to a hospital or have to take anything else. I do not know if the white spots are actually from the injection or if it was caused by a medication I am taking. But since it was a weird occurrence I thought I would report it

                                                1 hour after shot, throat felt slightly off. 22 hours after shot began to experience headaches and head fog. Following day had extreme body aches (especially on sides), headaches, head fog, and fever.  Very lathargic. Throat felt normal again.  Following day most body aches were gone, but also received periodic headaches and still had some body aches and soreness. Began to feel itchy. Itchiness location wandered throughout day - began in groin, moved to legs, moved to chest, then to head. Following day still have itchiness but primarily on head and to some extent on feet. In the evening, upper lip also became very swollen. This is current status of side effects felt.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, depressed mood, brain fog, irritability, tinnitus, body temperature fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. No treatment was received for the events. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The event outcome was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded. However the clinical course, relevant medical history and concomitant medications are pending for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At approximately 4:30pm, on the day I got the vaccine, I began to feel the effects of Encephalopathy and Encephalitis, in which I began to feel pressure in my skull, and felt confusional thinking. It became hard to discern my thoughts. I also, began to experience a difficult time with my vision not being able to control what my vision was focusing on, as well as seeing a blue tint in my vision. I am also experiencing mild pressure and aches on the right side of my back and left side of my chest. These effects have been continuous for the last 4 days. To treat these symptoms I have been using natural remedies, and have maintained a stable condition due to that.

                                                I started smelling smoke around 8:30 pm on the night of the 16th, but I assumed it was from local fields being burnt. Then I started smelling cigarette smoke, sometimes strongly, sometimes faint. Even when I am work, inside the office, and there is nobody around. Even now as I write this, it smells like I am in the same room as someone with a lit cigarette.

This continued for two days. - It is now 6 days out, and still experiencing brain fog (days 3-6 so far), which I didn&#39;t really notice until fever began reducing on day 2. The fog has also come with general fatigue, though not as bad as during fever period. Can be difficult to concentrate, focus, and feels associated with slight pressure in ears.

                                                Days after receiving my first vaccination, I began having strange sense of taste and smell. The issue has not resolved and seems to be getting worse. I had my second vaccination yesterday, so I am unsure how that will affect it. Cooked meats, toothpastes, soaps, charred vegetables, etc. all produce a strong gasoline-like odor that makes eating/brushing teeth extremely difficult. I?ve altered my diet to include very basic foods without much flavor. Not all foods have the smell, but when the smell is present it is pungent and I cannot stand to eat it. I am not experiencing a loss of smell, but definitely have lost 30-40% of my ability to discern smell beyond the chemical/gasoline sensation I mentioned earlier.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Started feeling very fatigued around 6/7 PM on 1/7/21. Ate dinner shortly after and took my normal sleeping pills as previously listed. Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

                                                About one hour after injection developed left facial numbness while I was on my way home. Not full numbness, but felling as if coming out of a novocaine shot. Left side chin, lips, cheek extending up to ear/eye. No sign of swelling, droop, redness. Has lasted 2 weeks &#43; and has improved over time but not fully resolved. Now is more an occasional numb feeling mostly in L cheek/lips/corner of L eye. I grind my teeth during stressful times and grind more on my left side so was thinking it could be related to that. Sought medical attention from my doctor who felt said most likely not Bell&#39;s palsy related.

My colleague is also experiencing this...in her case beginning 1 wk after dose #1 (I encouraged her to report this too not sure if she has yet). I find it fascinating both people are experiencing this after the vaccine and as an NP I felt compelled to report to help aggregate such data.  Both my friend and colleague obtained the vaccine around the same time at the same clinic.  Thank you!

He experienced fatigue, malaise, ear pain, head congestion, fever day 1-3, followed by general improvement but development of a diffuse erythematous maculopapular pruritic exanthem, loss of taste and smell day 4, and episodic bloody diarrhea day 6 or 7. The exanthem has had limited (if any) response to steroid (day 5-9) and he has continued to self treat with Benadryl and atarax at home. He has just been released from quarantine. The dermatitis is improved but not resolved. CBC and CMP were normal.

This was 5-15 minutes post vaccination as he was being observed. We laid him on the ground and he immediately started to feel better. After a few minutes he sat up and drank some orange juice. Paramedics were called but patient was able to walk away on own accord. Called  later and was doing fine.

He was attended to by RNs who checked his blood pressure and pulse. His BP was 60/30 and his pulse was in the 40s. He was laid flat with his feet up. His blood pressure was then rechecked a few minutes later and it had come up to 102/60. His pupils constricted back to a normal size and he said he was feeling better. He was given water to drink, observed for 30 minutes and walked out to his car by an RN after 30 minutes of observation. He did report that he does this with all vaccines. He was driven home by another driver.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  I got the vaccine on Friday, and on Saturday night I developed phantosmia. Until now, basically 55h hours after the first shot, I feel cigarette smell very frequently. Sometimes is weak, sometimes is strong, but there are rare moments that I don&#39;t feel it at all - usually noticed when I start to feel it again. In the beginning, I thought that it could be caused by a roommate, but when I talked with them no one was smoking or feeling the smoke smell. When I came to lab, a clean space, I felt it again and noticed that it was really abnormal and that I should report. Additional info: I had a positive test for COVID-19 on January 16th and recovered really well after having only a mild fever for one day and a sore throat for 4 days. I am sure I also had COVID-19 in January of 2020 after a trip, when I had very bad symptoms including heavy lungs, pain in the lungs, yellow mucus, coughing, sore throat, headaches, and fever - and also a negative test for Flu at my health center.  At that time, mainly because of the negative test, doctors described it as a strong cold. It lasted for two weeks. We didn&#39;t think it could be COVID at that time, though. I realized that later when we learned more about the symptoms.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt very tired and winded as if I was working out for hours on no food. I did eat that day. I felt dizzy and saw black dots in my vision and felt the need to sit down. I never made it to sit, rather fell flat on my face and passed out for a few moments before my cousin came and picked me up asking what happened. It was very embarrassing and I believe the fall on my face caused an infection in my jawline on the left side and a sinus infection. I was throwing up and blowing my nose from blood. Very scary sight to see.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

Massive tension headache and pressure behind eyes and sinus that has lasted so far for 3 weeks, tinnitus, blurred vision, joint pain, muscle weakness, muscle twitching in face and throughout body, numbness in all my limbs, burning sensations on my neck and back, stomach pain, and heart palpitations that sent me to the ER. When I walk and move my arms I feel weak. The vaccine has effected my nervous system in a terrible way. The ER doctor, ENT, PCP, Optometrist, and Opthamologist told me it was inflammation due to the vaccine. I was prescribed 6 days prednisone, 40mg for 2 days then taper down and they put me in a &#34;let&#39;s wait and see&#34; mode. All symptoms have persisted since. I follow-up with a cardiologist on 05/14/2021 and waiting appt for a neuro ophthalmologist.

                                                Within a minute or less of receiving the shot, I experienced a rapid and intense onset of blurred vision, lightheadedness, profuse sweating, and extreme numbness all over but especially in my hands and feet. I came close to losing consciousness and was instructed to lay down with my knees bent to increase blood flow. I slowly came to over the course of probably 10 minutes while laying on the ground, but my hands and especially my fingers remained numb for 30-45 minutes while I experienced chills. My left hand and fingers were extremely pale and bluish during this time. I also had minor pains on the left side of my neck and left shoulder blade. Color came back to my left hand and chills subsided around an hour after my shot.

Heart rate normalized after half hour of rest. b) Acid reflux three days after vaccination. Took Omeprozole &amp; Sucralfate tabs and recovered within 3 weeks. c). Tachycardia &amp; palpitation occurred on 4/12/2021. Hard to fall asleep at night. Visited ER, no treatment (blood test, chest X-ray and EKG all normal).   d).  Excessive fatigue following just a few steps of walk, or speaking just a brief moment. Began to be sensitive to screen light and sound from loudspeakers. e). Hospitalized on 4/16/2021, b/c of breathing problem, numbness (hands &amp; feet) and muscle cramps. Called 911 for ambulance to hospital. Discharged on 4/18/2021 after testing normal for chest X-ray, EKG, echocardiogram. Prescribed Bisoprolol Fumarate tabs.  f). After discharge from hospital, I had to remain on bed b/c of breathing difficulty upon standing up or slight movement. Excessive sweat during sleep or after meals. g). Subsequently I felt a little better and began to do minor exercises (walking in the yard) May 14-19.  While lying on the bed on the night of May 19, I felt short of breath and worsening of breathing patterns (i.e. shallow breathing). h) On May 23, I began to feel shortness of breath when I walk or after a meal. i) Staring May 24th, I felt very weak breathing when lying on bed. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume. j) Staring May 27th, I felt shallow breathing when I was at rest during the day. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume.

                                                Pain in jaw, head, neck, shoulders, and lower back. Started May 30. Not an injury from trauma. Not from overexertion. Back and shoulder pain subsided about about 5 days, but neck pain and headache continued through Tuesday, June 8. Treated with Ibuprofen and Tylenol with little effect. Went to the emergency room on June 2 at the advice of a physician. No apparent cause. I was given a strong anti-inflammatory that eased the pain slightly. The pain was about 5-6/10 for the duration of the event. Relief only came with a full-body massage from a licensed massage therapist. Still suffering from some jaw pain and minor headache.

Dose 2 - I had very severe body wide nerve pain, vertigo, terrible migraines, vision issues, confusion, short term memory loss and grasping for words and increased muscle weakness. It kind of mirrored a stroke. The pain was a 10/10. It was basically like all of my symptoms were getting progressively worse over the weeks. It&#39;s gotten better, but the symptoms are definitely still there. My neurologist increased the dosage of a few of my meds. At this time, they&#39;re basically managing my symptoms, but we do not have a definite source for the issue. However, the vaccine definitely caused the flare up because nothing else in my life has changed.

He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

                                                everything was muffled and he had constant ringing in the ears; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at single dose as his first dose, via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 06Jan2021 at single dose as his second dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. There included unspecified medications and stopped several of them a week ago on 05Jan2021. The patient was having a side effect that popped up out of the middle of nowhere, and he went through his meds, and he wanted to see if anyone else was having these issues. The patient was having ringing in both ears that happened late Dec2020, and in the beginning of Jan2021, and he had both rounds, he was an RN (registered nurse) at a hospital, and the ringing had gotten louder, and the only thing, medication, drug, that he took PO, over the counter, the only thing that correlates was it happened after both vaccines, later clarified as COVID vaccines. Right before the second dose, it was really really loud, and then he got the second dose, and over the last 1.5 weeks, the ringing has gotten worse in both ears, so he called his primary care, who referred him to ENT (ear, nose and throat), and he saw ENT, and to look in the ear, he said it was the nerve, he didn&#39;t know what triggered it in both ears, he said it was usually only in one ear if it&#39;s a viral thing, so it&#39;s uncommon in both ears, and the doctor asked if he was on medication, and the caller stopped several of them a week ago on 05Jan2021, that would cause it, but it had gotten worse. The patient didn&#39;t know etiology or how the vaccine worked, but he tested for COVID and it was negative, and his doctor was asking him if he experienced this any other time, told him to stop medications, and it&#39;s gotten worse, asked him if he was on any recreational drugs, he was on no new meds, he was a nurse, and works in ICU, and basically didn&#39;t know where it come from, but suddenly, everything was muffled and he had constant ringing in the ears. COVID test was about 2 weeks ago, the rapid was negative, then the PCR was negative. The outcome of event was recovering.

I am an otherwise healthy 32 y/o male with no relevant PMH and never with tinnitus prior to this. It continues to persist for 2 days. No other relevant sx to report. Seemed worthy of reporting given the likely timing of my peak antibody response at the 14d mark and general vaccine monitoring concerns of cross reactive antibody responses.

                                                Experienced bouts of mild vertigo lasting around 5 seconds a few times a day starting after the second or third day of vaccine.  By the weekend it hadn?t gotten worse to the point where I couldn?t leave the bedroom due to the walls literally spinning. That?s as the worst day then it progressively lessened until it went away by the second week.  Thought it was worth a mention.  My gf that I live with has also had ringing in her ear non stop since the second vaccine, so I?m a little concerned about the second shot.

                                                Was feeling fine the day I received the shot, albeit some pain at the injection site. I woke up early the next morning and my left jaw was sore, my left knee was swollen and hurt to move/walk, and the bottom of my left foot felt strange. There is also a very, very dull wave-like ache across the bottom of my front teeth.

The taste is not in my mouth all the time, just when i eat certain foods. Usually it is red meat that causes the taste. The taste is hard to describe. It is bad but does not make me sick to my stomach. It has been two weeks since the shot and the symptom os still the same.

                                                I had a sudden case of hearing loss (felt like my ear was suddenly full of water).  I got it around 1 or 2 days after vaccination. ENT specialist diagnosed it as a side effect of the vaccine due to seeing an uptick in similar cases after vaccination.  Side effect went away after around 4 days woth no treatment. Went to ER because I had a previous case of SSHL and was afraid this was the same thing.  Also had minor arm pain in both doses.

                                                I had one large cup of coffee with cream and 3 doughnuts for breakfast approximately 3 hours before the vaccine. I took one Claritin Readitab approximately 2 hours before my vaccine injection to help with pollen allergies.   I was seated during the vaccine injection.  The injection was delivered into upper left arm. I felt fine at first. I stood and exited the room and began speaking with the pharmacist that had delivered the invention to receive instructions. Approximately 2-5 minutes after I received the injection I began to feel dizzy. After approximately 1 minute of dizziness I sat down.  I began to get extremely dizzy to the point of faintness. I noticed during this time that I was getting very sweaty. My skin over my whole body seemed to me to be damp from sweat and where I checked I was sweating visibly (no droplets formed? it was just dampness). At the same time I experienced nausea. I believed that I might throw up, so I requested something to throw up into. I never threw up. I continued to get more and more dizzy and I had trouble remaining upright (while seated). A woman observing me stated afterward that my eyes rolled back and that I fainted. I do not believe that I actually fainted because I remember hearing her tell the pharmacist that I had passed out. I had my eyes closed though, so it is possible that I fainted briefly.  The pharmacist called 911. I began to feel better approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I stopped sweating, and then the nausea subsided, and then my dizziness cleared up.   The EMTs arrived approximately 20 minutes after I received the vaccine and took my blood pressure. I do not remember the reading, but the EMT stated that it was not elevated. My blood oxygen was 99%. The EMT waited about 10 minutes and took my blood pressure again. He stated that it was higher, but not concerning. The EMT waited another 10-15 minutes and then left. Before he left, the EMT stated to me that I was one of 2 concurrent calls regarding adverse vaccine responses.   After this event I drank a bottle of  water. It did not seem to have an impact.   I have not received vaccinations since I was a child. I do not remember adverse reactions to injections when I was a child. I did pass out when giving blood approximately 12 years ago. I have always attributed this to the fact that I did not eat or drink for 20 hours prior to donating blood.

The night of shot 2 and since, I?ve been incredibly bother but quickly forming canker sores that are lining my upper gums and inner upper lips. As of today, I count 6 active sores. I?ve also experienced lip swelling from a sore that eventually split the inside of my upper lip.   Note that I cannot recall ever really having a canker sore before and while correlation may not equal causation, it seems tied to the vaccine since it was already present after dose 1 and was then exacerbated by dose 2.

I began seeing black spots in my vision, which then developed into kaleidoscope vision affecting both eyes but in my left field of view.  I took ibuprofen and laid down with a cold compress.  The vision issues lasted for approximately 30 minutes.  The headache and neck pain persisted until the next morning which was accompanied by vertigo.  I then decided to go to the ER and was diagnosed with a migraine with aura.  I have never experienced a migraine or visual problems before.  The doctor at the ER recommended I make this report in case my symptoms are linked to the vaccine.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved.

March 2 I started to feel my chest burning and I had to catch my breathe going up the  stairs and taking also took a lot out of me to do.  Still on March 2 around 11 pm I lost my smell and taste.

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

I then experienced a headache in just above the base of my neck in the back of my head and that lasted for approximately 5 minutes.

                                                About two hours after getting the vaccine I started having flu like symptoms. The arm where I got the shot started aching, it felt a lot like tennis elbow. I got waves of intense nausea. My nose began running. I developed a sore throat.  I got waves of light headedness, occasionally feeling like I may pass out. And I was extremely thirsty. No matter how much water I drank, my mouth was dry and I felt severely dehydrated. This lasted for about three and a half hours and then passed and I felt normal again.

                                                Patient fainted 10 minutes after receiving his first dose of the Covid vaccine. He was sweating profusely and very clammy. We gave him an ice pack and monitored him for 30 minutes after. His blood pressure was 90/60 a few minutes after the episode but then it came up to 124/84 a few minutes later. His eyes were dilated and we were concerned about a possible concussion from the fall so EMS came and evaluated him. They cleared him to go home.

                                                I have some mild tinnitus which I&#39;ve had for 15 years since high school and rarely bothers me. Go months without noticing it.   A few hours after my first dose of Pfizer (left arm), I got a headache and some queasiness. The expected side effects. My ears started ringing louder and more pronounced, which I assumed was a side-effect of the headache and/or immune response to the vaccine. It&#39;s past two weeks now since dose 1 and my ears are still ringing much more loudly and noticeably than in the last 15 or so years. All other side effects have long ago subsided. It seems to be worse in left ear, the same side I got shot on. I imagine that&#39;s irrelevant, but mentioning it anyway here.   Distracting and distressing.  Am scheduled for a second dose on April 21 and now hesitant about getting it.

                                                While taking a warm Epsom salt bath I started to feel faint. About 1 minute after getting out of the bath my vision became worse and I fainted. I was alone at the time so I dont know if hitting my head on the floor or the fainting caused loss of consicousness. I was out for 20 min to 1 hour. Lost 4-8 oz of blood from bloody nose caused by hitting my head on the floor.

A 33-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 31Mar2021 at 13:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Seasonal allergies (trees, grass) and related fruits (apples/cherries/peaches).

As I am driving out of the parking lot, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/nauseous, and my vision becomes extremely blurry, even to the point of near blindness. I stopped the car and sat for about 30 seconds/1 minute until my vision returned sufficiently to drive back to the waiting area where I requested water. I immediately felt better with the water, and the staff also gave me benadryl although I don&#39;t think it had any impact. I felt weak for an additional 30 minutes or so and spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. I felt fine to drive after this 30 minutes and have had no side effects since.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of even to the point of near blindness, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/felt weak, nauseous and my vision becomes extremely blurry. No treatment was reported for the event spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. Outcome of the events was recovered on 31Mar2021.

I learned that this is called Tinnitus and that more people have found to have tinnitus or that their tinnitus has increased after vaccination. One week after, I am not sure if the Tinnitus is getting better or I am getting used to it. Next week I&#39;ll see my doctor.

                                                I got shingles about one month after the second dose. I had severe pain around my spine and back on Friday (4/23/2021) and by the next morning developed red bumps on the left side of my nose that I at first mistook for acne. They produced a very tiny amount of white liquid secretion. The bumps turned darker and I got a red rash on the left side of my nose. The left side of my face as well as the lymph nodes around my collar area swelled up. By Tuesday morning, it spread to my left eye, so I went to the ER where they started me on two new antibiotics. After none of the antibiotics worked, I started an antiviral (acyclovir) and antiviral eye drops and started to improve. The rash and swelling reduced and no new blisters have formed. The doctor and I both thought it likely I had shingles.

A 33-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Mar2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the vaccination in the pharmacy. There was no medical history or concomitant medications. There were no other vaccines administered in the last four weeks.

The clinical course was as follows: the patient was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. He set an alarm. He bought some food to eat (potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22. He felt strange/weird, but this was not an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for the patient. He was driving to work and started to get a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later, he started to get dizzy, ears rang, felt blood pressure drop, and passed out going freeway speeds. He was treated in the emergency department and released the same day. There was no treatment given in response to the events. There was no covid prior to or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Written off a psycho and about to be committed, but was brilliant.  I believe I was given an undiluted dose of Pfizer without diluent, and became psychotic, and furthermore I believe my parents, who also got it, have had their judgement affected as well.  They have been a lot less urgent with concern for their welfare of me since the shot. All they do is sleep all the time, wouldn&#39;t take me to the ER even when I was having trouble reading and staggering around.  I understand I have no credibility here, but please look into this matter seriously, and not just the ravings of a crazy person.

                                                A few days after the shot I noticed I had mild tinnitus. I have never had tinnitus before. It did not immediately occur to me that it might be connected to the vaccine; I learned about tinnitus as a symptom over a week later. The tinnitus has recurred regularly since receiving the vaccine on 4/20. Today is 5/7.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose?

As noted in the Fact Sheet for Recipients, you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection.

After about 5 min. passed, his girlfriend alerted us that he was feeling faint.  I went to check on him and after talking with him for a few minutes, his head rolled back and he lost consciousness for approx 5-10 seconds.  I went into the pharmacy to dial 911. When I got back to him, he was already back awake.  Fire dept was dispatched and they checked his vitals and he signed a form to go AMA to the hospital.

My eyelids became puffy and the area around my eyes was swollen and ached. My eyes were also very sensitive to light. This started on the morning of day 2 and is still lingering, but better, by day 4.

                                                I thought I was suffering from a bad sinus infection, completed a ten day course of Augmentin about two and a half weeks ago. The infection didn&#39;t go away, seemed to get worse with worsening headache/eye pain/fatigue and nasal congestion/post nasal drip. I requested a nasal swab by my provider to identify what was going on in my nose.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

He said that this typically happens after he gets a shot or is exposed to needles.  He then asked if he could lay himself down because he says that is what usually helps him feel better.  His SBP was measured to be in the 80s initially with a heart rate in the low 50s.  His oxygen saturation was normal.  He was given some water to drink.   After a few minutes, his heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal.  We discussed having him go to the hospital.  After our evaluation, the patient preferred to go home.  We asked that he go to the hospital if his symptoms returned.

                                                April 7, woke up with a headache, took ibuprofen. A few hours later, started feeling hazy, lightheaded and had trouble concentrating while working from home. Felt like I was going to pass out. Took a break from computer screen, symptoms appeared to subside.  An hour later, same haziness feeling came back. Thought I was going to pass out again. Called 911. ER diagnosed  me with near syncope. Told me to keep an eye on symptoms and come back if things worsen. I informed them I had received one dose of vaccine, they didn?t seem to think it was related.  Symptoms have slightly improved since, but still have bouts of dizziness four days later.

                                                Patient was shopping in the store after receiving the vaccine and passed out. Patient&#39;s spouse lowered him to the ground. Upon arrival to the scene, patient was talking &#34;saying i&#39;m fine). I helped patient to sit up and eventually helped him to sit in a chair. Patient said he could taste the vaccine while receiving the shot and he told the immunizing technician about it. Patient left after 20 minutes without any treatment.

Symptoms started with minor tingling on tongue, then went to chin, then after a short period of time covered my entire lower left side of face from chin up through jaw and into ear. Extremely minor scratching and tingling in throat.  Entire episode only lasted a few hours. Then was mostly gone.

                                                Within 24-36 hours of receiving the vaccine, a rapid thumping noise developed in my right ear.  Within 48 more hours, that symptom has become less frequent but a permanent ringing noise (tinnitus) has developed.  It is primarily in my left ear but can seemingly be heard in both ears.  It has not stopped since I noticed it around 4/04. I have been checked by an ENT and they noted no conditions and my hearing/pressure/nerve tests all came back as normal.  I have never had any previous tinnitus issues whatsoever.

It?s been recurring pain especially when I move my arm in certain ways. No health insurance at the moment, haven?t seen a physician about this or received an MRI.  The more concerning though is recurring vertigo I?ve been experiencing. I have never had it before, but a few days after I?m receiving the dose my eyes started shaking involuntarily and I had difficulty keeping my balance.  It went away after a bit, but has happened a number of times over the last two weeks.  I?m obviously hoping it just goes away.

                                                I had a nasty zit on the back of my neck, popped it, and my immune response was extreme. Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

A 34-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot/batch number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 15Apr2021 at 16:30 (at the age of 34-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history reported as no other medical history, no known allergies. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications reported as none. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After 5 min from taking the shot on 15Apr2021 at 16:35, patient started feeling dizzy little bit. He thought walking around the aisle. But he still really felt very fatigue. He wanted back and a suit and started breathing hard. He started seeing everything turned yellow and barely could breathe.

I have had two other &#34;events&#34; that I assumed were gallbladder attacks but the pain subsided within a few hours. With this event, after a few hours and the pain was still high, I had to be driven to the ER. Just before leaving my house I started getting tunnel vision and my arms and legs went numb. I was able to walk on my own again once reaching the hospital. As of today, 5 days later, I am still in pain. I have taken out all fatty foods and things that are bad for gallbladder issues and still no change.

A 34-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular in Arm Left on 17May2021 (at the age of 34-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0187) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included higher than normal blood pressure, about 2-3 weeks ago, his blood pressure was very high due to really crazy stress in his life and eating terrible; headaches, smoked marijuana, drunk vodka, sometimes he had a sensitivity to needles, sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, Sometimes he got a little queasy with the sight of needles and just had a ton of dental work done. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (Generic Brand Zyrtec); caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) taken for headaches. He explained he took Generic Brand Zyrtec which he had been on for years now and he took Excedrin for headaches when he got them. Those were basically the only medications he took really. He hadn&#39;t had any type of vaccine. He previously had a tetanus shot about 10 years ago for Immunization. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on Monday, 17May2021. Within 3-5 minutes of getting the vaccine, he had a really crazy reaction. He remembered looking at his wife and she told him he was having mild convulsions as he was sitting in the chair in May2021. He was kind of shaking in May2021. He turned ghostly white and he began sweating profusely in May2021. He mentioned that her wife said that he was not conscious for around 5 minutes and was &#34;snoring with eyes open&#34; in May2021. He added that he was &#34;fighting to stay awake&#34; for around 15-20 minutes after that. He blacked out. All he remembers was that he was trying to fight off tunnel vision for a very brief time in May2021. The pharmacist continuously checked on him. The lightheadedness and feeling like he was going to black out lasted 15-20 minutes in May2021. They put him in a chair and told him to elevate his feet, but the caller explains he could not elevate his feet. He had his feet in another chair in front of him. He couldn&#39;t get comfortable, he was sitting down. He was restless, lightheaded. He kept feeling like he was going to pass out. So, then he tried to stand up and walk a little bit. He only made it 5 steps. So, he sat on the ground and laid down. He laid on the ground, flat on his back, and put his feet in a chair, which was about 2.5 feet above him for about 15-20 minutes. He started to feel better. He still felt very tired and weak in May2021 but he was able to stand up and walk and go home. He hadn&#39;t had a reaction since. He had had no other symptoms besides just a sore arm in May2021. He confirmed he recovered completely from his experience when he was administered the vaccine. He came home from the vaccine facility, laid on the couch and watched TV for a couple of hours and then fell asleep for 3-4 hours. He was tired, but he felt completely fine. He had no lightheadedness, no dizziness. He also wanted to add sometimes he has a sensitivity to needles, but he didn&#39;t when he received the COVID vaccine. Sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, but he was actually excited to get the COVID shot. He was even comforting his wife and was telling her everything is going to be okay. He wasn&#39;t worried about the needle with the COVID shot. Sometimes, he gets a little queasy with the sight of needles, but he saw the needle and he didn&#39;t feel faint or angst when getting the shot. He just had a ton of dental work done, where he had huge needles shoved in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel faint or anything. He really wanted to get the second shot to finish the vaccination series. He did kind of believe he had a reaction, he was not trying to play it off and say &#34;oh I got the vaccine and passed out&#34;. He knew himself and knew what it&#39;s like to faint and this experience just felt different. He believed he had a reaction. He never felt tunnel vision that strong in his entire life, it felt like being punched in the face. Since those 2-3 weeks, his stress load had gone down and he had had a drastic change in his diet, so his blood pressure was reading much better now. This past Monday, 17May2021, when he received his vaccine, his blood pressure shouldn&#39;t have been that high.  The EMT&#39;s did come before he left and because he passed out his blood pressure was low at 100/60. When providing the Lot number off of his vaccine record card, the patient explained the last digit was either a 7 or a 2, he can&#39;t read this person&#39;s handwriting&#34;, however, he eventually confirmed the number was a 7.  The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The outcome of event tired was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovered in May2021.

It stated to go away, but never fully dissipated. The next morning while getting ready for work, I noticed I could not taste anything, and mouth felt a bit numb. Also had some residual facial numbness.

I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

                                                Itchy hands and palms lasted for 3 days. Rash on both left and right upper arms not by the injection site.  On 1/14 the right half of my lower lip swelled up and would continue to do so until 1/15 around about 0730 after taking a benadryl.   Symptoms and issues seem to happen sporadically without a pattern or warning.

                                                First dose of vaccine received on 12/18/20: no adverse reaction, felt great Second dose of vaccine received Thursday night, 1/7/21: no adverse reaction that night but woke up with sore L arm in the morning. So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen. Same symptoms on Saturday with increase in intensity, plus mild fever in the evening at 99.6 F (instead of 97.4 F which is &#34;my normal&#34;), nausea, painful eye balls, sensitivity to light and noise, loss of appetite. Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

The last occurrence was about a year prior to this current event. I?m not entirely sure it is related to the vaccine, however my right eye swelled shut over night. I have no other adverse events. Today, I have taken OTC allergy medication, allergy eye drops, Benadryl, Pepcid, and Ibuprofen.  The swelling is now going down.

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

                                                blister; fever; chills; body aches; herpes in his mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 35-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hemophilia A.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. The patient stated that he got his first COVID vaccine, but stated that he has hemophilia A and was worried about getting the second dose. The patient reported that two weeks later after getting the vaccine, on 02Jan2021, he had fever, chills, and body aches. He went to the dentist on 02Jan2021 who told him that he had a herpes in his mouth. The patient stated that it was just a blister. All of these effects have gone away completely now and he has recovered completely. The patient stated that he was able to get the fever under control by 06Jan2021. He was not scheduled to get the second dose yet but stated because he worked at the hospital he can go anytime and get it; he just had not gotten it yet because he wanted to ask about the hemophilia A. Clinical outcome of fever was recovered on 06Jan2021, for chills and body aches was recovered on 04Jan2021, for herpes in mouth was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the blister was unknown.

                                                Swelling of the R eyelid started 5 days post-vaccine.  Initially thought to be a Sty. First tried conventional warm compress multiple times a day.  That did not help.  Started to use Raw Honey and Hot Black Tea bags on eye, that brought the swelling to a head (pimple),  and started to drain at week 2.  Then the docs prescribed erythromycin opthamolgic ointment and I had an adverse reaction to that which increased the swelling again.  Now going on the 4th week, the swelling is still present and not showing any improvement.  Is it possible it&#39;s related to the vaccine??

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Mar2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2614) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included bradycardia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient also has no known allergies. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was vaccinated at Public Health Department. The patient previously took bnt162b2 first dose on 27Feb2021 02:00 PM (Lot number: EN6198) at the left arm for covid-19 immunization. Concomitant medications (reported as Other medications in two weeks) included: ibuprofen, vitamin C and unspecified multivitamin; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported that &#34;Two hours after receiving my second dose on 20Mar2021, I went on a car ride that had several thousand feet of elevation change. Throughout the drive, my ears equalized pressure comfortably. When I reached my destination about three hours later (3:30 PM), my left ear began experiencing a &#34;dead&#34; feeling, but I could still hear and distinguish sounds and tones. I went to sleep, and the sensation remained. The dead feeling has escalated to tinnitus, which is a condition that I have rarely experienced in my life.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered. No treatment was given.

                                                I experienced an unsettling metallic / bitter taste in my mouth about two days after vaccination. (It?s now lasted for six hours and counting).  I called an urgent care / telehealth line and am relieved to hear it?s not something to worry about unless it persists for a very long time - like 2 weeks. But I wanted to report the symptom here so that hopefully more people are aware that this is a possible side effect - and that it can appear well after vaccination day. It?s not listed on the handout I received. For what it?s worth,  I didn?t have this reaction to the first shot which is a little puzzling.  Anyway - hope this helps!

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

Dry mouth and sweats followed. Symptoms lasted around 30 minutes. Roughly 60 minutes after vaccine was administered, heart rate gradually decreased to around 100 bpm (with the help of breathing exercises). Another 20-30 minutes later, heart rate fell to around 84 bpm. The rest of the evening/night, heart rate steadied in the 70s. Normal heart rate while awake (between 62 and 65 bpm) followed the next day.

                                                Onset began with a flushing/warmth feeling in the right side of face about 35 minutes after injection, with itching on the roof of the mouth accompanied by feeling of swelling in the area. This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

Foread was hot to the touch, ague, severe headache, light and noise sensitivity.  The room was cold, I turned up the heat in the house and put on sweatpants, socks, thermal shirt, hoodie, and beanie and could not get warm.  Began drinking water (1.5 gal by end of day at 2300).   No appetite for the entire day, nausea set on after eating a bowl of oatmeal around 1030.  Had several episodes of dry heaving, but no vomiting after eating.  Ate again at around 1900 - chicken broth and a peanut butter sandwich, nausea set on at around 1945, dry heaving, but no vomiting.  Spoke with PCM on symptoms and continued to monitor.  On 26 Mar21, cold sensation had abated, continued drinking water.  Headache, light sensitivity, nausea, and body aches for the entire day, headache has remaind constant - 6 out of 10.  Nausea at a 4.  Body Aches varied between 4-7.  Around 1100, I noticed that my neck had stiffened and it felt as if I had a tension headache.  I used a theracane, heat, and an ice pack to try and relieve the tension with no success.  I have tried relaxation techniques learned from VA to manage pain with no success.  As of 2146, stiffness is around a 6, headache is a 7, body aches 3, nausea while sitting 1, while walking 4.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

Slept on the other side and went ok. Next night same pain around 5am, this time I couldn?t sleep after.  Then 3/4 days after the shot, pain in my groins and intestines. It feels really irritated and pain varies from 1 to 4.5 on a scale of 10 throughout the days. It?s been now 10 days since the shot and this pain is not getting away or improving. Sometimes I also experience pain in the left side of my  stomach as well but it?s much less frequent than groins and intestines.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

He also had eye floaters before receiving the Covid 19 vaccine but now the eye floaters are catching the light more often which is creating a flashing light every now and then. It was happening in both eyes, the floaters are happening more in his left eye. He reported the ophthalmologist said his eyes were fine. He reported he was borderline on his eye prescription and according to the ophthalmologist the Covid 19 vaccine might impacted his eye muscles a little bit and pushed him over to the next prescription. The ophthalmologist said the blurred vision should go away in a few days. The ophthalmologist also said he had not heard of any vision side effects with the Covid 19 vaccine, and he should be fine a day or two. It was reported that patient was not visited to emergency room of physician office. At the time of report, patient was not recovered from the events. Additional information has been requested.

About an hour later, I experienced slight swelling under my left eye and cheek. A few minutes after, my throat began to have a scratchy feeling and a slight wheezing which was concerning. As soon as I experienced this feeling, I took one Benadryl immediately. After about a half an hour, the swelling under my eye and cheek gradually went down, my runny nose stopped after a few minutes , and my throat itching stopped after about 15 to 20 minutes. I felt fine afterwards.

                                                Severe fatigue, and severe body chills. Fever. Muscle/joint pain. Took a very hot shower for an hour to stop the chills. It was so bad it was hard for me to walk. Slept for most of day after shot. I was extremely fatigued and all I could do is sleep. Some very minor visual disturbances (trying to focus my eyes). Slight altered level of consciousness when body chills hit.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

                                                He began to have some severe pain in his ears to the point of 8/10.  He went to the hospital, saw a doctor and they gave him some medication Amox/clav that he took.  He did not help the pain.  After 2 days he went back to the ER on 3/7/21, they gave him another antibiotic called Ofloxacin ear drops.   He found out that he had a hole in his ear drum.  He has never had an issue like this before, and he was fine when he got the vaccine and feels it&#39;s related to that.  He has had no problems other than the regular side effects which only lasted for 1 day and then went away.  Yesterday, 3/8/21 the problem shifted to the other ear.  He is beginning to feel pain on his left ear as well now.  He has terrible hearing loss due to this issue.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

Approximately 48-72 hours after injection, patient experienced left eye pain and developed a non-itch-inducing rash in left temple.  Following after this period, eye pain worsened, as did the size of rash (stretching from temple to back of left ear - along the V1 nerve).  Patient was diagnosed with Shingles and is now receiving treatment for that virus.  It is theorized that the vaccine induced an immune response to attack the novel virus, and left its guard down for the dormant Herpes Zoster virus.

He received his COVID vaccine about an hour prior to arrival to ED. He denies any tongue swelling, throat swelling, difficulty swallowing or shortness of breath. He has never had anything like this happen before. Since onset, it does not seem to have gotten worse.

                                                Odd taste in mouth started soon after (on drive home) and persists 5 days later (at time of report). Feels like bad breath but other people can&#39;t smell and it seems to only be taste. Nickel, coppery, and metallic in flavor. Brushing and flossing mask it for a bit but it returns, even without eating or drinking anything. No adverse impact to eating or other activity, just odd. Very very similar to an effect I had one time after eating pine nuts.

Onset 18 hours post-injection, resolved approx. 36h later. Removed lens immediately after onset.  3: Extreme eye irritation and redness in left eye, which *did not* have contact lens in. Onset 26h post-injection, resolved approx. 24h later.  Note: No reaction to 1st vaccine dose at all, not even injection site soreness. COVID-19 (PCR positive) 5 months prior to 1st dose; sympomatic but mild: low grade fever resolving within 4 hours of onset, anosmia, nasal congestion, moderate headache.  No professional treatment sought, treated symptoms with ibuprofen, resolved within 6 days.  2/3 likely coincidental, but due to time proximity to vaccine I wanted to report it in case a pattern emerged.

At about 33-35 minutes after injection, my throat started to tickle and I could not stop coughing - even after being given 2 bottles of water and a mint. at about 38 - 40 minutes after injection it started to feel like a lump or a rock was in my throat  At around 12:30 - 1:00 am on the morning of 04/22/2021, I notice there were blisters on my gums - one on my upper left gums, one on my upper right gums and one on my lower right gums

                                                Recipient had a prior history of the feeling of a lump in his throat, narrowing of his throat and dry throat with his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This resolved with oral Benadryl at home.  Prior medical history included COVID disease in January, 2021. Due to his history, he was vaccinated next to our ambulance with physician and EMS team in attendance. Approximately 5 minutes after vaccination, recipient began complaining of dryness of the throat and feeling a lump in his throat without any compromise in breathing. Approximately 9 minutes post vaccination, he complained of a progression of his swallowing symptoms, swelling and pressure feeling (periorbital and in the malar area) of the face. He did not complain of dyspnea. Due to his symptoms, he was administered 0.3 mL of epinephrine IM at 10:39, followed by diphenhydramine 50 mg IM approximately 1-2 minutes later. Symptoms seemed to remain static, with treatment, with the exception of post-epinephrine shakiness and complaints of tingling of his feet. Initial vital signs were: Pulse 90, Respirations 20, BP 148/84 and SaO2 of 99. Vital signs and SaO2 remained stable.  A transport ambulance was notified and recipient was transferred to the care of EMS for further treatment and observation.

A 37-years-old (current age of 37-38 when the reported events began) male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0I58; expiration: not reported), intramuscular, administered in arm right on 12Apr2021 16:00 as single for Covid-19 immunisation/covid precautions, not wanting to get covid at pharmacy or drug store. The patient medical history was none. Concomitant medication(s) included vortioxetine hydrobromide (TRINTELLIX; received within 2 weeks of vaccination). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine), no relevant family medical history. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and since the vaccination. No other products and no investigation assessment. On 13Apr2021, the patient had headache, sensitivity to light, was feeling lethargic, balance was off, fatigue, and hypersomnia. The headache and vision impairment (start date: 13Apr2021) were ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and at first the headache was very severe and now was just different and his headache kind of moved around and was always constant and persistent and got better and then boom it came back. The patient had been a little lethargic (start date: 13Apr2021) and that began the same day as the headache and vision impairment which was the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine. Dizziness (start date: 13Apr2021) began the very next day after the vaccine and was almost like an imbalance of whenever he was walking, he noticed he was kind of not walking a straight line almost and was going left and right trying to stay in balance (start date: 13Apr2021) and this was a little bit better. After the 1st dose the patient was getting a little concerned right now because he got the vaccine about three weeks ago and ever since he had been having severe chronic headaches and vision impairment that was ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine; the patient was a little lethargic, kind of had dizziness off and on and went to his PCP, had an MRI, and was sent to a neurologist. The patient was taking Advil, Motrin and Tylenol that were not helping his migraines (start date: unspecified) and nothing from the bunch of medications the neurologist gave him were working to help and stated Nurtec ODT (lot 3990840, expiry date Oct2022 and NDC 72618-3001-1) 75mg once daily and Nortriptyline 10mg (orange pharmacy bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC) supposed to be one capsule the 1st week and then two capsules after that by mouth. Motrin, Advil and Tylenol (no lot numbers, expiry dates or UPC numbers to provide because he ran out of those and threw the bottles away when he was done and has been meaning to get more but has not). Unspecified medicines, Toradol IV were given as therapeutic measure. The patient was not sure about the dates regarding his MRI (MRI was maybe a week and a half after this all started and then maybe a week after that he saw the neurologist). Headaches kept him up to night also and the patient had been to neurology, ophthalmology consultation, and received an MRI. The adverse events resulted in disability or permanent. The patient had not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated. The patient had no further treatment and had not gone to the ER but was under advisement that he was to go to the ER, but he could not afford to go to the ER. The patient had not had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yet and his PCP and neurologist both agree that he would not be getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine due to the reactions he has had. The patient was calling to see if Pfizer offered help as he was without insurance and his PCP said he might need to send the patient to the hospital which might be out of the question and he was calling to see if Pfizer could help him with anything as he has not been at work for three weeks and the headache was not going away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging with no results on unspecified date and nasal swab (sars-cov-2 test) was negative on 15Apr2021. The outcome for little lethargic/feeling lethargic was not recovered, severe chronic headaches was not recovered, sensitivity to light was not recovered, balance is off was not recovered, fatigue was not recovered, hypersomnia was not recovered, not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated was not recovered, vision impairment was not recovered, kind of has dizziness off and on was recovering and for migraine was not recovered.     Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events was considered related to suspect drug based on Compatable temporal association and known safety profile of the drug.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                After leaving site (while driving), my tongue became very heavy and almost difficult to swallow. After approximately 20 minutes, it passed. At the same time my right arm (opposite the injection arm) began to have muscle spasms which too passed. A wave of cold spread throughout my body and immediately my anxiety began to skyrocket (untriggered). None of these symptoms occurred after 1st dose.  Insomnia the night of both the 1st and 2nd doses.   Nearly 2.5 weeks after 2nd dose, dizziness is a daily occurrence followed by symptoms of vertigo (at times wakes me up at night). Fatigue has intensified.

                                                3 Days following my second shot, I felt a horrible shock/pain through my neck and jaw that made me crouch down in pain in the middle of a busy street. I went straight to an urgent care. The provider said it was a vaccine side effect and gave me steroids to take for four days. The next week, I went back because I began to feel a pulling sensation/pain develop on the side of my face. They referred me to an ENT. I went to the ENT.  He found a vocal chord nodule and ordered a CT scan.   Before I could make the CT scan appointment, I had an episode in the shower where I began to see flashing lights and my limbs became wobbly and weak. I was very dizzy and had to hug the shower wall for support. My wife took me to the emergency room where a multitude of tests were run including a CT scan. Nothing was remarkable, but the doctor was concerned about the neurological effects, and referred me to a neurologist.  I saw the neurologist the next day, and she diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia on top of ordering an MRI of my brain (normal). I am taking carbamazepine and baclofen as treatment for the condition. She said it can occur virally.

He woke up his mother at 5:40, came to his mothers room and said that he was shaking, and mother noticed that he was, trembling.  She asked what was wrong and he said that he could not stop shaking and his chest was hurting.  She set him down in a chair and she got the autometer to check his BP and oxygen, and his BP was 134/98, and his 02 was 96, heart rate 86.  She felt him to see if he was having a fever, it was 98.4.  She told him to sit for a little while and waited about 10 minutes, she checked his BP again at 6:00 AM, and it was 139/102, he said that he was feeling really dizzy, his head started hurting real bad.  He said that he had a bad taste in his mouth.  She just monitored him, and his 02 was still 96, heart rate was still good.  He stayed in her room until 6:15 and she got up and told him if he got worse she would take him to the ER.  At 6:25 she gave him two 500 mg of Tylenol tablets and sat him in a recliner.  At 7:30 his head was still hurting, but he was not shaking, and she gave him some yogurt and water.  He stated that he started feeling better and around 7:40 he went back up to his room and went back to sleep.  He has been ok since then.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

It was loud enough to keep me awake and the ringing has not stopped, even up until this point. I can still hear out of the right ear, but I cannot hear over the ringing. High pitch noises I can hear amplified, while it is difficult to hear anything else. I can also feel the vibrations in my inner ear during those high noises. I did take 800mg of Ibuprofen before bed and I know that NSAIDS can be associated with Tinnitus but this seems very out of the ordinary for me with no medical history and remarkable health screen.

                                                Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 at 15:15 hours.  A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

A 38-year-old male patient (husband) received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number EL3248 and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 18:00 (vaccine location: left arm) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included hypogammaglobulinaemia, from years low IGA, chickenpox and shingles in the past. The concomitant medications were not reported. No history and additional vaccines administered on same date. On 20Jan2021 when patient woke up, right now at 09:21 AM, he noticed right side facial pain near the anterior right ear and traveling down the facial cranial nerve from that area to his jaw. Reporter stated this was typical Bell&#39;s Palsy and the usual treatment is the same as for herpes zoster; steroids and antivirals is the recommended treatment. Reporter is planning to call the doctor as she feels he needs treatment right away and she will get the doctor to prescribe this treatment. Patient has a weak feeling coming from the jaw. Patient had a history of chicken pox and chronic herpes zoster but this was the first time he had had Bell&#39;s Palsy. States the effects are persisting and medically significant. Patient was scheduled for the second dose 09Feb2021. Wanted to know about if patient should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                No history of severe allergic reactions.  Observed for 15 minutes following vaccine injection.  Felt fine at that point so I was told that I could leave.  About 10-15 minutes after leaving (about 25-30 minutes after vaccine injection), I started to feel tingling in the bottom half of my face (most noticeable in the bottom lip and chin area), slight swelling on back sides of tongue, and slight swelling of area under chin at the top of the throat (right side only).  I could still breathe, drink, and talk normally.  Although symptoms did not seem to be intensifying, I decided to seek care at a nearby urgent care out of caution.  I arrived at the urgent care about 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms (about 45 minutes after vaccine injection).  Provider evaluated me, administered pepcid and a Benadryl shot, and notified me that if I went into anaphylactic shock that they would administer an epipen and call an ambulance.  Vitals were normal and remained normal throughout observation.  Symptoms began to abate about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Tongue swelling abated first about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Active tingling in the chin abated about 30 minutes after Benadryl injection, although light numbness remained.  Swelling under chin abated about 45 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Provider or staff checked on me every 15-20 minutes.  Provider released me from observation after about 2 hours.  At that point all symptoms had abated with the exception of slight numbness on bottom half of face, which persisted for several more hours.

He asked for help and first they walked him to a chair and then laid him down. He recalls the MD taking his pulse and reporting it as 140. He states his awareness was blurred, but he remembers receiving the epi pen and then feeling better. He recalls sweating but not sure if it was before or after epinephrine. EMS arrived, started an IV and transported him to ER. He denies recalling pruritis, urticaria, oral face throat or tongue swelling, watery eyes, chest pain, cough, wheeze, nausea or emesis. ER observed him several hours. His discharge diagnosis was syncope. He denies recent use of antihistamines or H2 blockers. Per chart review, provider at the event recorded patient c/o hot dizzy, tachycardia, erythema bilat arms, chest with extension to the neck, diaphoresis, difficulty responding (single word only); treated with epinephrine with improved response.

                                                Per the patient&#39;s mother, after receiving the 2nd vaccine dose on 2/19/21, patient &#34;became different&#34;.  He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

                                                Initially, it started with some odd headaches exclusive to the right side of my face - near my sinus cavity extending to my right temple and around my right ear.  On day 10, March 20, 2021, at approximately 5:00 pm, I lost all hearing in my right ear.  I was turned away as a possible ear infection, but due to the complete loss of hearing, I followed up on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.  After being seen by an ENT, I was diagnosed with Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in my Right ear.  I have started treatment with my first injection into the eardrum and am currently on day 3 of oral steroids (predniSONE - 20mg Tablets, 3x first 7 days, 2x days 8-9, 1x day 10).  No improvement or recovery as of yet, if at all.

I was presenting in a meeting at work and felt this come on; even blinking or swallowing didn?t moisten my eyes or throat. I was hydrated but felt a strong need for eye drops (which I didn?t take). This persisted into the evening and I woke up the next morning with very dry eyes; I used eye drops at that point.   2 days later and it?s mostly subsided.  Some history: PRK Eye Surgery in 2005 while serving in the . I do wear a single contact lens in my left eye (very low prescription) but had not worn one that day or for 2days prior. Haven?t worn a contact lens since the vaccination.

                                                I am a board certified physician in gastroenterology and internal medicine and work for the Medical Center.  I have no hearing or ear history.  Received Pfizer vaccine from work on 12/21/20 L arm IM, no side effects, sore arm for &lt; 24 hours, second dose 1/11/21 L arm IM, no side effects, sore arm for &lt; 24, however, on 1/22/21 work up with muffled hearing and bringing in the left ear only.  Called colleague Doctor who started prednisone 50 mg immediately on 1/23/21 and continued for 4 weeks without improvement.  Audiometry testing 1/25/21 demonstrated moderate high-frequency hearing loss suggestive of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL).  Emergent CT head and MRI brain and ear were unrevealing.  20 session of hyperbaric oxygen therapy from 1/21-2/21 without substantial improvement.  Vasculitis workup negative with normal ANA, CRP, ESR, ANCA, CBC, CMP.   3/21 COVID-19 antibodies test for exposure negative.  4/21 noting more public event reporting of hearing loss and tinnitus associated with vaccines. reports-grow-amid-covid-19-vaccinations/) while I understand there is not causal evidence yet linked, I feel that there is a temporal relationship and odd correlation that needs to be recorded and accounted prospectively further.  Vascular surgeon, Hematologist who are treating me for a PE and DVT post ankle fracture and surgery do not correlate the SSHL with my DVT, PE, or anticoagulation.  To date 3 audiometry tests demonstrate persistent left-sided moderate high-frequency hearing loss.

A 38-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 24Mar2021 09:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included indapamide, and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3248) on 04Mar2021 11:45 AM on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that on 24Mar2021 he received his 2nd dose of COVID 19 vaccine. On 25Mar2021 he woke up at 6:30am with fatigue and a stiff jaw. At around 2pm he began feeling feverish accompanied with body aches and it continued until 3:30am of 26Mar2021. During that time, he did not notice any face or jaw discomfort. On 26Mar2021 and 27Mar2021 he had little to no symptoms other than slight discomfort in his jaw. On 28Mar2021 he began to feel more intense symptoms in his face, losing the ability to move/control muscles in the right side of face. The symptoms were moving from his jaw to my cheek and impacting his vision. He reported that this was out of the norm, and it prompted him to contact his healthcare provider. On 29Mar2021 at 1:40, he sought care from his healthcare provider. After a full examination he determined that he had a moderate (level 3) case of Bell&#39;s Palsy (reported started on 25Mar2021 07:00). Bell&#39;s palsy resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. He was prescribed 80 MG/day of Prednisone for 7 days. The patient has not recovered from the events at time of report.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I could see but everything was like if I was not wearing my glasses or contacts when I was. I checked to make sure if it was my contacts but my vision was still blurry with my glasses. I had planned to seek medical help if it was still blurry by the following morning but my vision had returned to normal by evening time (did not note the exact time but around 7).

I was unconscious for 30 seconds, and while unconscious my eyes started to role to the back of my head. When I became alert I was on the floor and I couldn?t breathe! While on the floor gasping for air I vomited twice! 911 was called and an EKG was done on site! It showed that my heart rate was low, and I was transported to hospital ER department. Multiple test were done on me and everything came back perfect! No high blood pressure, not a diabetic, and no Permanent head damage.

                                                Brother felt dizzy and saw double vision with left side body fatigue which was diagnosed as a stroke. He has bleeding in the back of his brain. Went to the ER at Hospital and took a CT Scan and MRI which showed bleeding. Brother had normal blood pressure and everything was fine with him but the stroke happened after a week of his 2nd Covid-19 vaccine dose. He lost strength in his left part of the body and had a speech slur and double vision. He had to wear an eye patch and had a headache. Hospital said no surgery was needed and transfered him to Rehab for rehab. He is currently there getting treatment.

A 38-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8737), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Apr2021 14:00 at age of 38 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included mystery cough from 2018 and not ongoing, seasonal allergies, used an arnuity inhaler for this, ADHD and depression. Concomitant medications included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from Sep2020 to Apr2021 for depression; bupropion from Aug2020 to 20Apr2021 for depression; amfetamine sulfate (AMPHETAMINE SALTS) from 2018 and ongoing for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Around 14Apr2021, he had cold and flu like symptoms. He said he had headache, and sinus pressure, drainage and congestion. He said he felt dizzy, and he compared his dizziness to a feeling one gets before one passes out. He said it is associated with head or eye movement, and that there was a nerve shoot through his head down to his arm. This was accompanied by a tingling sensation that would usually last for less than a second. He said this reaction lasted for 2 and a half weeks. Patient mentioned that he consulted his physician, and was prescribed with doxycycline, which helped with the relief of his cold and flu like symptoms, as well as the congestion. He said it has been cleared for 5 days now. On 17Apr2021, patient said he had fever with a temperature of 100 F. He was concerned because the fever had not subsided ever since. On 17Apr2021 he had onset of fever which was ongoing. He was struggling to narrow down the choices here. He was grasping at straws trying to figure out if this ongoing fever fits in the realm of rare side effects of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and asked for further information regarding the fever. He later mentioned he also had cold-like symptoms and an other weird symptom. Fever was typically in morning temperature was 100.2 to 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit then got to about 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon. Cold-like symptoms was for the first 2.5 weeks had headaches, sinus-related symptoms like runny nose, congestion, sinus pressure. He thought the sinus pressure in particular could be associated with the other weird symptom he had. One of patient&#39;s sons daycare had a cold going around his class on 14Apr2021; some of the kids went home with colds and fever so he initially chalked this up to that. Otherwise he did not think so. As a kind of cover her but his doctor did prescribe doxycycline which he just finished the last dose so been on that for 10 days at 100mg twice daily. He thought due to that any of the sinus symptoms he had have dropped. He felt cured of those other than fever; only fully recovered completely about 5 days ago (06May2021). Patient had COVID PCR test: First test in Apr2021, probably on 19Apr2021 or 20Apr2021. Not admitted to hospital, no ER visit, but went to hospital that his physician was associated with to have chest x-ray (Nothing notable found) and blood panel (Nothing notable found, didnt lead to anything. Standard blood work nothing notable found. White blood cell-nothing notable found.) done on 24Apr2021. COVID antibody test on May2021 was positive (IgG positive for COVID antibodies, IgM negative, no active COVID). COVID PCR test in Apr2021 and 26Apr2021 was Negative for COVID. AE (virtual visits for the fever) required a visit to physician office. Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine delayed twice now; was supposed to get second dose on 03May2021 but since had a fever been told he can&#39;t. Outcome of event fever was not recovered and the other events was recovered on 06May2021.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

I was light headed and had a little bit of breathing weirdness. It probably only lasted about 2 minutes. I laid down and all symptoms went away in about a minute.   The only other time I fainted in my life it was from seeing blood shoot out of my body but it wasn&#39;t accompanied by heart flutters.

He washed it and it was still blurry. After 1 hour, he decided to go to the ED- was worried about possible stroke in his eye or retinal detachment.  No retinal detachment found in ED; was discharged from the ED, not admitted into the hospital. Followed up with ophthalmologist as instructed on 12/27/2020.  Retinal scan done and found no retinal detachment but the doctor found fluid found behind the retina.  MD recommends rest, less stress at work.   Unknown if related to vaccine per MD - mentioned no data is available to compare.

It first became loud about 30 minutes after the shot, then became better the next day, then became loud again, and has persisted for the past 2 weeks. I am trying to deal with it mentally but sometimes I am just barely holding down anxiety attacks.

I after a week I went to an ENT and then an audiologist. I have been put on a high dose of prednisone steroids (90 mg with a body weight of 200 lbs) now for three days. No improvement. The ringing is terrible, it is hard to sleep and concentrate. I now have to turn the volume up on tv and music to hear things that I could hear before.

Patient reported the symptoms started ?10 minutes? status post vaccine. Patient denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and was presenting conscious, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and event (AOX4).

Baseline vitals were obtained by EMT at 1508, while patient was sitting: blood pressure: 150/88, respiratory rate: 14, heart rate: 80, pupils equal and reactive to light. EMT observed the skin to be dry, warm, and normal. Chief complaint was then reassessed and patient claimed his vision had improved and symptoms were subsiding.

Patient stated he has a history of headache and denied any past medical history or taking any current medication. Patient has allergies to seafood and shellfish. At 1515, a second set of vitals were obtained by EMT, while patient was standing: blood pressure: 154/90, respiratory rate: 14, heart rate: 85, pupils equal and reactive to light. EMT observed the skin to be dry, warm, and normal. Patient was negative for orthostatic pressures. Patient was advised by the EMTs to stay another 30 minutes in the observation area, totaling 45 minutes. At 1545, patient stated ?all symptoms have subsided.? Patient was released and ambulated on his own, out of the facility, with a steady gate. EMTs encouraged the client to sign up in order to document any additional symptoms.

Left eye remains the same: heavy, puffy, and swollen. I took a pill of Benadryl, and applied ice.

                                                Took Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on 20th April, 2021 at around 1:30 PM. After couple of days, lost the sense of smell while having food. I was not able to smell the aroma of the cooked food. I also had no sense of taste while having food. E.g. I tried raw red chillies / onions with food. But neither I did feel any reaction to my taste buds nor any smell. I can smell perfume, garlic from a close distance. However I did not feel any taste while having oranges. I informed my doctor about this who ordered a covid test for me. The result is negative. I am not taking any medicine / treatment for this. I am just waiting and hoping that the sense of taste will be back within few days. I am not sure if it has any connection with the vaccine. I just thought I will mention it to the concerned people.

She advised I go to urgent care. I went to urgent care and they checked my blood glucose levels, EKG to check my heart was beating correctly. Urgent care advised I go to ER to get further evaluation done. I went to ER where they evaluated me. Advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine and to monitor. The following day (Fri) still felt slight swelling/numbness. Symptoms became worse in the evening called nurse line to explain swelling on my lip and face. Advised to take benadryl then go to ER. I went to ER in another location.  ER Dr. advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.

                                                hearing loss; bad tinnitus in his left ear; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 39-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 14Feb2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9266; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 39-year-old years) for covid-19 immunisation.  The Patient received second dose in left arm on 07Mar2021 11:45 lot number: EN6201, expiration date: Jun2021.  Medical history included ongoing asthma which was diagnosed when he was 9 years old. He states the he is also susceptible to chest infections.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced hearing loss (medically significant) on Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered and bad tinnitus in his left ear on Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included acoustic stimulation tests: this morning it&#39;s in his right ear on 21Apr2021 and  acoustic stimulation tests: hearing loss on 2021 the hearing loss was initially only in his left ear; magnetic resonance imaging: negative on unspecified date.  He is an audio engineer and sound editor and that is how he makes his money. He states that today (21Apr2021) will make the 5th hearing test in total and his hearing hasn&#39;t gotten any better.  Three weeks ago it was only the left ear and as of today the right (21Apr2021) ear is also being affected.  Symptoms started in Left ear and are now in the right ear as well. An MRI was done and that was negative. He thinks it is related to the vaccine. The patient went to the physician office for treatment.  The patient did not have additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect.  The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks.    Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.
