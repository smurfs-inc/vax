Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

He got the shot, I filled out his card, and directed him and his mom to sit in the waiting area for 15 mins in case of dizziness or a reaction. They were walking out of the room to the waiting area and he almost immediately fainted. He fell and possibly hit his head on the chair/ floor when he went down. (This was maybe 2 mins post-injection). He almost looked like he was going to have a seizure (arms were tensed up, his eyes were not focused, was starting to shake) but then he suddenly came-to. He seemed to be pretty coherent after he woke back up but 911 was called since he was bleeding

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post vaccine, mom alerts the pharmacist that patient is experience some visual disturbances. The patient states that he felt dizzy/eyes were &#34;going black&#34; in and out. Heavier breathing than normal. States it feels harder to breath, but no reports of swelling or itching. Also states that ears were ringing. Pharmacist attempted to check blood pressure on patients left arm with an automatic cuff, but the machine errored twice. Then attempted to check BP with a manual cuff. Reading was varied due to patient moving his arm and hard to hear. Seemed to be around 90/50, but not precise. After 10 minutes, patient stated he was starting to feel better, just felt thirsty. Pharmacist rechecked BP on right arm with a different automatic cuff and reading was 104/62, with a pulse of 101. Patient continued to improve, stating that visual disturbances were gone and hearing had returned to normal. Was able to stand and walk around without feeling dizzy. No difficulty breathing reported at that time. Patient and mom waited another 5 minutes to ensure he had no symptoms and then were able to leave approximately 25 minutes post vaccine.

Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

We put the patient flat on the ground to protect from a fall injury and his seizing stopped. His color was very ashy and he was not responding properly to questions we asked.  In about 2 minutes, he became more coherent and began talking  and responding to our questions. Paramedics were immediately called and they arrived 30 minutes later after 3 phone calls to follow up.

Client&#39;s mother signaled to EMT that they needed assistance. EMT and RN responded. Client was a 16-year-old male found sitting upright and leaning forward while alert and tracking. Client had a chief complaint of ringing ears and uneasiness. Client stated that he began to notice his ears ringing a few minutes after observation began. Client&#39;s mother was unable to console the client prompting her to calmly wave for assistance. This was the client&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. He and his mother both deny any medical history, allergies, or regular medication use. Assessment revealed no hives, rashes, discoloration, swelling, shortness of breath or other signs of anaphylaxis. Client complained of unspecified uneasiness while leaning forward but exhibited no accessory muscle use. Client denied any pain throughout his body. Airway, breathing and circulation were intact. Client stated that he was &#34;nervous&#34; before receiving his vaccine today due to stories he had heard from his peers. Client then stated that he felt like he &#34;couldn&#39;t move [his] hands&#34; despite there being no obvious range of motion compromise. Vitals at 1332 were pulse 76, O2 100%, lung sounds clear bilaterally, alert and oriented to person, place, date and event, respirations 20. Client and mother both consented to an additional 30 minutes. Client was assisted from his observation chair to a bed by EMT and mother and stayed there for the remainder of his observation. After approximately five minutes of lying down, the client stated that he felt &#34;much better.&#34; Remaining vitals: 1337 - 118/78, O2 99%, Resp. 16, HR 76, 1349 - 110/76, HR 72, O2 99%, Resp. 16. 1402 118/78, O2 100%, HR 72, Resp. 16. Client&#39;s mother was provided with all relevant vaccine information and instructed to seek medical attention if further concerns arise in the evening. Client denied EMS transport. Client completed his observation at 1402 and departed with his mother at 1402 in positive disposition with steady gait asking his mother if he could go out and &#34;skate&#34;.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Second dose of Pfizer vaccine received Friday afternoon (4/2/2021). Went to bed Friday evening with &#34;normal&#34; side effects of mild fever and sore arm at injection site. Woke up Saturday morning with no sense of smell or taste. Called primary care provider who conducted a video visit and expressed concern that he may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 prior to injection (no symptoms displayed at all in weeks prior). Order a COVID test for Sunday morning. Woke up Sunday morning with sense of taste and smell back. Proceeded with PCR test, which came back as &#34;negative&#34; on Sunday evening. No other symptoms observed, and other side effects noted above (sore arm, fever) resolved by Sunday morning as well. Seems to suggest loss of sense of taste and smell likely due to vaccine since there was a clear temporal relationship which resolved in approximately 24 hours.

                                                On the evening of 4/11/21, pt. suddenly had trouble hearing and had tinnitus in his left ear.  He reports it felt clogged/stuffy &#34;like being on an airplane&#34; as well.  He saw an ENT the morning of 4/12/21.  The doctor cleared wax from pts. ear and an audiologist performed a hearing test.  The results showed a loss of 50% of hearing in his left ear along with tinnitus.  His diagnosis was sudden sensorineural hearing loss.  Pt. was given an Rx for prednisone, valtrex and N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine for two weeks, which he started on 4/12/21.   Dr. ordered an MRI with contrast of pts. internal auditory canals which will be performed on 4/21/21.  Dr. referred pt to another ENT who pt. saw on 4/16/21.  Drs. audiologist performed another hearing test which showed some improvement in hearing in the left ear but no improvement in the tinnitus.  Dr. injected steroids through pts. left eardrum to the space behind it.  Pt. will have additional injections on 4/23/21 and 4/30/21.   As of today, 4/18/21, pt. reports that his hearing is worse and the tinnitus has not improved.

I shout &#34;call 911&#34; and held his head which tilt backwards with eyes rolling back.  together with his mother we lowered him to the floor and I supported his head at all times; as he was flat on the floor, he raised his own head and regained consciousness.  Both mother and I tried to talk to him and keep him awake when he closed his eyes, he was laying on the floor flat and talking until EMT arrived at 16:42.  EMT pulled him off the floor and took him to the ambulance.

                                                The day after the vaccination started hives.  But it was slow so thought could be food allergic reaction. Over a period of 2 weeks it developed never went off.  Noticing the hives   getting worse and the epsode starting day after vaccination suspected it the cause and so went to primary care physician.  She diagnosed the hives related to medical side effects and only medical related item he had within the last 1 year was this vaccine.  She put him on Methylprednisolone for 6 days along with Cetirizine HCL 10mg.  The hives appeared to be suppressed for the first 3 days where the dose was higher, however, when the dosage was getting lower after day 3 it came back with high intensity.  Lips, fingers, tongue...swollen and with fever running at upto 101.6.  Again went to the doctor, she put him on Prednisone with 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10mg for 3 days and 10mg alternate days.  It literally took more than 1 and half month still not recovered.  Hives are still on and also severe cold with mucus and cough started since (05/09/21).  Fever show up on and off even now.  We&#39;re referred to allergy specialists.  She asked to not take 2nd dose.  Increased dosage of Antihistamines, asked to continue Prednisone 10mg for 6 more day daily 10mg and if cold and cough does go in the next 2 days may put on antibiotics.

                                                Patient was the 4th person to receive today?s vaccine of Pfizer. This was his second dose. He did fine the first dose. Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

A 17-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Apr2021 16:00 as unknown, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fish oil; magnesium [magnesium citrate]; vitamin d [vitamin d nos]; probiotic [bifidobacterium lactis]; vitamin b complex (VITAMIN B). The consumer stated, approximately 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine (28Apr2021 16:15) the patient felt dizzy, eyesight was blurry, and he began to shake and jerk. It resembled a seizure. His skin turned pale, heart rate was high, and he felt nauseous. It took him approximately 5-10 minutes to feel &#34;normal&#34; again. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The adverse event result in emergency room/department or urgent care. There is no treatment for AE. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was resolving.

It used to be at about a 2 out of 10 but now it is like a 7 or 8 out of 10. My hearing has also become super sensitive. So sensitive to the point where talking with someone at medium volume hurts my ears.  So sensitive that daily things that used to be no problem are now unbearable loud.

                                                Pt was seen at ED on5/8 for L sided weakness in the setting of a headache. Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

Mom caught him and called for help and reported his eyeballs rolled up and he started down when she caught him. by time Pharmacist and store staff got there (less than a minute) he had regained consciousness but very lightheaded. No breathing difficulty. So got a chair and had him sit with head down and store staff observing. After another 10min he still reported lightheaded and nausea, so ambulance was called. When they arrived and checked him out everything checked out normal and he was feeling better so they released him to his parents care. Called on 5/24/21 at 10:10am and spoke to mom who reported he was doing fine and no apparent after effects.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

He then sat up, ate a snack, and drank water and was observed for an additional 15 minutes. Vitals were within normal range. Patient stated feeling&#34;normal&#34; and &#34;fine&#34; after this and he was able to go home without additional issues.

                                                On 4/6 my son noticed changes with his vision which continued to 4/7 at which time we brought him to his pcp. She referred us to his eye doctor. They got him in that afternoon, did an exam, told us to follow up that Friday. At the 4/9 follow up he was diagnosed with sixth nerve palsy on the left eye. We scheduled a MRI and lab work. Lab work came back fine. He went for the MRI on 4/16. The MRI showed several brain lesions pointing towards MS. We went to a medical center on 4/20 where they thought the finding lesion were incidental and not related to MS. We saw a neuro-opthamologist on 4/21, who said he felt my son did have MS with sixth nerve palsy. We saw a neurologist on the afternoon of 4/21 who said patient didn&#39;t meet the criteria of MS and to follow up another MRI in 3 months. That weekend patient started with areas on numbness. He was due for second covid injection which all providers agreed with us getting. He got his second dose on 4/24 during this flare of numbness. We went back the neurologist on 4/26. Patient was given a three day iv steroid infusion, lab work and follow up MRI. The follow up MRI showed more lesions in his brain which lead us to the neurologist in another state. Dr reviewed both MRIs, felt the lesions were incidental, the flare of numbness as well at the sixth nerve palsy of his eye were related to inflammation related to the vaccine he received.

Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

                                                Vision problem. My son has been a homeschooled student for many years, using computer for his schooling without any problems. He had a minor injury to one eye shortly before the vaccination (scratched with hand), but after the shot, he complained of vision problems in both eyes. Redness, dryness, pressure, uncomfortable. Unable to concentrate and stay reading for more than a few minutes at a time. His primary doctor is now treating with antibiotic drops, but will take him to the eye doctor if he does not get better by Thursday as he will be done with the eye drops. We have also added allergy medicine, which seems to help a little. He is due for his second shot on 4/29. I still need him to get the shot to be protected from Covid, so hopefully, he will be better.

                                                After the first dose, I experienced tinnitus about every day for a week or two afterwards. The tinnitus would be present in one or both ears and last about 5-10 minutes. Illness set in roughly 30 min after the second dose. Illness has lasted throughout the last 4 days, and even through today. This would indicate the vaccine has made me ill for about 5 days now. Caused me to go to the doctor as I assumed the reaction couldn&#39;t be from the vaccine so long after the dose.

                                                Overnight, my (almost 19) son did not wake me, but reported to me in the morning that he had headaches, chills, numbness, thirst, and hallucinations. He was aware that they were not real during and after he had them, but it was a nonetheless disturbing experience.  He described to me having the need to hydrate all night and he drank a lot of water. This morning he was still having a headache and numbness as well as overall malaise, but has taken advil and eaten a light breakfast. He is dressed and up and around and seems to be improving. Should the symptoms return or worsen, we plan to take him for medical care.

Loss of consciousness was noted. Symptoms lasted approximately 15-30 seconds, and patient was placed in a reclined position. He regained consciousness quickly and became pale and diaphoretic. He was normally responsive and answered questions appropriately. Initial BP 74/32, HR 38, SpO2 98%. He drank some Gatorade and had improvement of symptoms gradually over 15-20 minutes. Repeat BP 100/58, HR 78. No past history of seizures. One prior syncopal event after pain response with sports injury. No prior difficulty with dose #1. After recovery, patient reported immediate pain with vaccine administration, then vision went blurry and he lost consciousness. Mother was driving the vehicle, and she witness symptoms as well as nursing staff in the vaccine pod. After recovery, options for further medical evaluation were discussed given complicated vasovagal response with seizure-like activity, mother called pediatrician to see if he could be seen, they recommended ER. Mother chose to drive by personal vehicle, rather than EMS transport. Symptoms were fully resolved and patient was transported to ER for further evaluation by personal vehicle.

He passed out and was helped to a sitting position.  When I was called out to the lobby patient was still feeling a little lightheaded but he was conscious and breathing normally.  He sustained a small cut on his hand which we cleaned up promptly.  Patient told mom he felt like his vision was  blurry.  Mom wanted him checked out so I called emergency help.

Sat down he started to sweat profusely. Told him to take his sweatshirt off. Continues to sweat his forehead his T-shirt was wet his back was wet. Then he tilted his head back his eyes rolled back into his head. I called the nurse. We got him to a wheelchair and behind the curtain. Before we had a chance to put him on the Exam Table he passed out and started to seize for the count of 3 or 4 seconds. Then he woke up. He said he saw white beautiful light. I am not kidding. He does not joke. Then he said he was fine. Insisted he was fine.  His bp was low for the first two readings. Then It came back up to normal. He laid flat for 15 more min. Had some juice. Sat up when It was gone to go. Bp got super high. We waited till It was normal and left.

A 19-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandson) received BNT61B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not reported), on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 19-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic (since 1 years old, he was diagnosed 1 week after getting the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine), dehydrated and rapid heartbeat (patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included insulin for diabetic. The patient previously received measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. The reporter (caller) mentioned that his grandson got the 1st dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021. Several hours later (04Mar2021), he experienced severe dehydration and thirst and could not sleep at night. He was very very uncomfortable and usually did not complain regarding experiences. He was young and going to college and he was living on his own. He was also diabetic. She was worried about his safety regarding his intake of the 2nd dose, so she was wondering if this had been reported and for any recommendations before and after getting the 2nd dose. They were consulting with his endocrinologist and the nurse at the endocrinologist&#39;s clinic said that they recommend young diabetic people to drink tons of water when getting the vaccine. Caller mentioned that she herself got the Pfizer vaccine and had no problem with it. Caller mentioned that his Grandson was diabetic since 1 years old. He was diagnosed 1 week after getting the MMR vaccine. She also mentioned that his grandson just recently got in college and he was in the younger side of the spectrum. Caller is asking if there is any data that would include her grandson&#39;s conditions in the clinical trials. Caller stated she was calling about the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and stated her grandson who was the patient was the one who received his first dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021 and that day he received the vaccine he told her that starting in the evening that same day (04Mar2021) she had never heard him so anxious or disturbed that he could not get relief and the adverse reaction he had was severe dehydration and thirst and it was giving him a fit. Caller stated she thinks he was probably 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; in height or so and thinks he weighed around and between 175-180 pounds when she last asked him. Caller stated she was not an HCP but was a medical technologist calling on behalf of the patient and because she was a medical technologist, she is medically trained. Caller stated she had not been able to get back in touch with the patient to get all the details for the report before she called around to get help but also stated the patient had his sleep interrupted after the vaccine was administered and he could not sleep but thinks this is all resolved and must have been resolved but she couldn&#39;t say for certain how long that he could not sleep or how long the severe dehydration or thirst lasted but she can find out. Caller stated the patient had not yet had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and had his patient card and stated she did not have the lot, expiry date or NDC for the first dose. Caller stated for the indication for which the patient was administered the COVID vaccine, she thought because the patient was diabetic and the HCP was very anxious for him to have defense against COVID and against all various types of virus or the school may have required it but she was not sure; states it was for the patient&#39;s own safety that his endocrinologist wanted him to have the vaccine. Caller stated that the patient did not have treatment for the reported event and he did not say to her that he had any treatment; caller stated she doubted the infirmary at his school is even open at the University and she did not know whether the patient would go to the infirmary or not. Caller stated she was calling to find out of there have been any reports or feedback on this reaction that the patient had or the adverse situation the patient had several hours after receiving the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; states specifically for the severe dehydration and thirst the patient experienced after being administered the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated the patient was due to get his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine three weeks from 04Mar2021 and she was most anxious to find out what recommendations were given or if Pfizer heard complaints about other adverse events like the ones she was reporting on the patient. Caller stated the patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat and he was with his father at that time; no further details provided by the caller. Caller stated the patient reported this to her in conversation a day or so after he had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and she is medically trained and it has been a long time since she used that medical training but the patient is diabetic since the age of 1 and he had good care and has been under the care of the hospital endocrinologist and his HCP since he was found to have diabetes and he uses his insulin pump very well. Caller stated the patient was off to college where very few were attending college and the patient had a very undesirable evening after the vaccine of lack of sleep and he was so thirsty and could not get hydrated and she knows dehydration is bad for anybody even if they aren&#39;t diabetic or if they have a life threatening type of illness but the patient was at school and did not have a family member to help take care of him and he was due for his 2nd shot three weeks from 04Mar2021. Caller stated she was trying to find out the best route for him to go report this and she told him to report the reaction to the HCP and to call the HCP who prescribed the vaccine; stated the patient&#39;s endocrinologist was not able to get in touch with the patient and he was not answering the phone; stated the patient is at college and he was on online courses. Caller stated she was very anxious to find out enough information about this and it is a concern to his treating physician and she was asking about recommendations about the patient not having his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; stated she spoke with the nurse that works with the endocrinologist for all of these 18 years they have cared for the patient. Caller states the HCP&#39;s nurse stated she had found that patients that receive the vaccine and have diabetes and are treated at the hospital they recommend that those patients drink tons and tons of water before having the vaccine because some types of people with diabetes have extreme thirst.  Caller stated she had no vaccine names, patient information or lot number or other information to provide on the patients that had the vaccine and have diabetes. Caller stated she spoke at the HCP office and stated there was no need for secrecy and HIPPA was not in Pfizer&#39;s domain; stated she cannot depend on the patient to look out for his own safety and she as a medical technologist used to give patients ordered glucose tolerance tests and she knew of the reactions that occurred with those patients and she did not want the patient to be stuck and wanted for him to do the smart thing of spending the night at home rather than drive back. Caller stated for those patients she administered glucose tests to she had no patient information or lot numbers or other information to provide and it was years ago before the Pfizer COVID vaccine came out. Caller stated she worked trying to get patient&#39;s diabetes under control at the University where she worked. Caller stated she already called and waited for organization but did not speak to anyone and left them a number to call her back a couple of days ago but she had not heard back; stated there were 18 people in the phone queue before her and she was hoping not to have to wait again. Caller stated her grandson probably does not had the time to wait on the phone being at college and he needed to do what he needed to do to be safe. Caller stated she had only spoken with the endocrinologist who treats the patient in his hometown and reported this information to the HCP&#39;s nurse and they are pretty good with follow up with patients. Caller stated she did not think the patient had other health issues and he actually had done extremely well on his insulin pump and had been on the insulin pump since about 3 years of age; stated she had no name of the insulin, had no lot numbers or further information. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

On21Apr2021, he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the Emergency department. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have worsening renal failure, follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. The patient&#39;s unilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. His kidney function continued to decline and hemodialysis was begun on 27Apr2021. His kidney function continued to decline on hemodialysis, becoming so he was transferred to the MICU for CRRT. The patient was hospitalized for 12 days due to the events, the events were also  assessed as life-threathening. The patient been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination with unknown result. The outcome of the events was unknown. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

This lasted for ~15 seconds. After this, the patient immediately regained consciousness, had no issues breathing, and was able to talk. Patient reported light-headed. 911 was called immediately upon reaction, first responders came in and took patient&#39;s BP and glucose. Glucose 91 mg/dL, BP was low (forget exact value), but returned to normal (~117/80) after about 10 minutes. Patient seemed fully conscious and aware, opted to not go to the hospital and signed a declination form of transport. First responders deemed that the patient was aware and did not necessarily need transport to the ER. Patient requested a ride home from friend/family member and is going home to rest.

This pit has been leaking fluid since 7:00 AM yesterday, on April 2. There is a mild, numbing pain in the region, and I&#39;ve taken Ibuprofin to deal with that pain.    I don&#39;t know how long this will last, but according to the handout I got, swollen lymph nodes are normal and I had no other adverse side effects other than feeling a bit drowsy this morning, though me staying up until 3:00 AM playing video games could be a confounding effect.

                                                This is my second COVID Pfizer vaccine dose. After both dosages, a couple of days later, I began &#34;smelling&#34; smells that weren&#39;t there. In my case, I was smelling &#34;cigarette smoke&#34; and &#34;wood smoke&#34; smells even though there were no cigarettes or wood burning in my vicinity. I had no health complications as a result, it was only slightly unpleasant at times. I did not seek treatment for this because it was a minor inconvenience and the issue went away after my first dose in a week. It hasn&#39;t been a week since my second dose but I assume it will go away similarly.

Attempted to stop the chills by wrapping in several blankets, but only continued to feel colder and colder. Despite the chills starting around 11pm, fever did not present itself until around 1am, hitting 99.8°F by 1:30am. It was around this time that I took an ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which did not kick in until around 2:30am. Once the chills stopped, my hands and feet only got hotter, keeping me awake for an additional 2 1/2 hours.

                                                Sometime after getting the Pfizer vaccine I noticed that my private area, underarms, and some other things now smell of onion. At first I had thought that it was the drink (Clear American Sparkling Water: Peach Flavor) that was changing my scent because it smelled and tasted heavily of onion. However, my thinking changed when the other flavors of this brand smelled and tasted as they should. My family and friends are not aware of the scent and cannot smell nor taste it. I have also noticed the scent outside my apartment complex on campus. There are no wild onions growing outside, but I can smell the scent when I walk near certain flowers or bushes before it fades away. Upon returning home the scent is still there. Showering controls the scent, but it gets worse throughout the day and makes me very subconscious about how I smell. I do not consume onion on a weekly basis, so the vaccine is the only oddball in my daily diet, so I believe that it is the culprit for this change. I believe that it may have potentially altered my sense of smell opposed to my thinking of my body odor itself changing. I have spoken to my Nurse Practitioner and we&#39;ve decided to play the waiting game, but she advised me to send in a notice of this to the CDC for additional help if possible.

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

                                                A few days after receiving the first dose I started having allergic reactions to certain food that I usually eat normally. After certain foods/sauces touch my lips they begin to tighten up and puff up. I suspect it may be my immune system being more active then usual due to the anti-bodies being produced. I&#39;ve never had a lip allergy before. This allergy reaction has been ongoing ever since the 1st dose. It is extremely frustrating to eat foods now.

                                                I have always had low grade tinnitus and migraine related visual issues, so this could be a completely a coincidence. However I feel the need to report it just in case. On the night of May 29, I had begun to hear a low noticeable hum in my right ear and a feeling of fullness. This humming disappeared and returned on Tuesday, June 1st 2021, and then continued on and became worse upon waking up on Wednesday June 2nd, 2021. I am scheduling follow ups with an ENT specialist in order to understand the root cause.

                                                Within minutes of receiving  covid-19  vaccine, I became very  excessive sweaty (my shirt was wet), felt eyesight was dimming,  space perception was completely off, very pale,  dizziness  and unable to hear when being spoken too, felt faint. Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

I&#39;ve had two allergic reactions before; this felt less severe, but otherwise similar. At 6:18 pm, I was given a shot of epinephrine, and started to feel better.   After that, I went to an urgent care center. They took my vitals, and everything looked alright. They told me to take Benadryl and monitor the situation, which I did. As I type (3:30 pm, 21 hours and 45 minutes later), I feel back to normal again: perfectly fine.

He clarified he had a real time COVID-19 Virus PCR test yesterday (07Apr2021), and received a negative result today (08Apr2021), less than 24 hours after having the test performed. He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system. He said he had no symptoms after his second COVID-19 Vaccine, and was wondering if what he was experiencing now was a delayed immune response. Reported last night was the worst for his symptoms, saying it was awful. He said he felt better this morning. He clarified that on Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well. He said his head felt heavy, but when he woke up, he did not feel too bad. He said he had fatigue, and on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow.

A 23-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included being a smoker (he vapes). The patient&#39;s sister has Addison&#39;s disease. There were no concomitant medications; no additional vaccines administered on the same date as BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EB8733) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 22Apr2021 at 14:00. He woke up on 23Apr2021 and felt like he had sinus pressure, then he blew his nose and had a bit of a nosebleed. He also felt like he could taste blood in his throat and mouth. The nosebleed stopped, but there was still some pressure in his sinuses. He asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He has a headache and it seemed like a sinus headache. It was more on the right side where he had the nosebleed. He could still kind of taste a little bit of blood in his mouth and throat. There were no relevant tests, but he was trying to figure out if it&#39;s needed. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. He was not hospitalized but he was trying to decide if he needed to go to the hospital. The outcome of the event nose bleed was recovered on 23Apr2021 and not recovered for all other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.  Follow-up (23Apr2021): New information from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: patient details, medical history, historical vaccine, therapy details, reaction data (&#34;Can taste blood in his throat and mouth&#34; and &#34;has a headache and it seems like a sinus headache&#34; were added; outcome and onset were updated), and course of events.

                                                I have had a horrible taste in my mouth since 10:15 AM MT. There is no loss of taste, as I can taste all of the foods/snacks I have eaten since the onset of symptoms.  The horrible tastes comes back as soon as I swallow my food and has lingered since its onset

This episode lasted about 5 minutes from onset was realized until resolution.

                                                Significant fogginess of brain which has only worsened and is still lingering to now (4/18/21). Simultaneously this is mixed with fatigue regardless of how much sleep I get or water that I drink. Less frequently I have symptoms like eyes burning (similar to bad allergies), slight dizziness, minor headaches, and minor body aches. The fatigue and brain fog are by far the worst and still persist, the others listed are minor but still come and go in small amounts. On Wednesday (4/14) I took Zyrtec (10mg tablet) to help focus throughout the day then one ibuprofen tablet (200mg) at night, and on Friday (4/16) I only took the Zyrtec. Since then I have not taken any medications. The symptoms were alleviated by the medication but without them all symptoms come and go to varying degrees throughout the day and worsen by night time.

The patient was asked to sit for a few minutes longer to monitor but said they were okay and went home. It was recommended to have Benadryl on hand in case they needed it, and if any of his symptoms worsened at all to go to the hospital.  I called and followed up with patient 1 &amp; 1/2 hour after his shot and he was feeling much better and had taken a dose of Benadryl. He was again advised to monitor for any more signs or symptoms of lip/tongue/throat swelling and to seek medical attention if was having any of these symptoms. He also was advised to follow up with his PCP to see if he should get his 2nd dose or hold off due to the reaction he experienced.

                                                Felt sick/slightly feverish 12 hours after shot, hard to sleep. Day after shot was mostly normal, though a little under the weather.  After another day, all cold symptoms were gone.   Tinnitus in the right ear started 3 days after 2nd Pfizer COVID shot. Initially was only audible at night, when sleeping in a quiet room, but after 2 days became audible during day.  Tinnitus presented as a high pitched steady ringing in the ear. Triggered intense anxiety and perception of the tinnitus increased to almost debilitating levels. Mental health counseling and prescription of daily amitriptyline to help with sleep and lorazepam to take as needed for anxiety has helped cope with tinnitus and associated mental aspects. Ringing still persists after almost four weeks after it started, but is perceived to be less loud now.

My manager rushed to catch him from falling and I assisted in steadying him. He was breathing erratically, excessively diaphoretic, and his muscles were twitching frequently. His eyes were dilated and he became unresponsive. Fearing a seizure, we lowered him to the floor and turned him on his side. He became responsive and coherent again approximately one minute later and was speaking to us normally. Paramedics arrived several minutes later and took over care. He was taken to the hospital due to abnormal vital signs.

On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

AT 5:45 PM WHILE PT WAS WAITING FOR HIS WAITING PERIOD TO BE OVER, HE BECAME VERY PALE, EYES DILATED, UNRESPONSIVE, AND VERY SWEATY. I ASKED FOR ONE OF MY COWORKERS TO CALL 911, WHILE I GOT THE EMERGENCY KIT OVER TO THE PTS SIDE. AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO 1 MIN, PT CAME TO, AND WE GAVE HIM WATER AND A COLD CLOTH. WE GOT HIM ON HIS BACK, AND KNEES BENT, WHILE WE WAITED FOR EMS. I TOOK HIS PULSE WHILE WAITING FOR EMS AND DID NOT NOTE ANY BRADYCARDIA OR TACHYCARDIA. EMS TOOK OVER CARE AND FINISHED EXAMINATION IN THE TRUCK. HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS WITH HIM AND SAID SHE WOULD DRIVE HIM HOME.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No. EWO187) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19May2021 at 12:00 or 13:00. Relevant history included Diabetes, obesity, endocrine abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, respiratory illness, compromised immune status and Allergies. The patient had Allergies to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can induce anaphylactic shock, severe reaction, swelling of face and throat. Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines were Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable. No Vaccines were Administered prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History was none. About 3-5 minutes after being administered the Vaccine, the patient immediately developed anaphylactic shock. He was transported via ambulance to the Emergency Room on 19May2021 where he verified he was admitted to the hospital Emergency room for about 5-6 hours and discharged from the hospital the same day, 19May2021. He was told not to get any additional doses.  He was still having swelling of the throat and went back to the ER today and was given a steroid prednisone 40mg a day for 5 days.  He was advised to take benadryl also.  He said he didn&#39;t get any IVs or anything.  He had a past medical history of anaphylactic reaction to NSAIDS.  He has been advised not to get the second dose. The patient stated the anaphylactic shock occurred with trouble breathing, throat was swelling and itchy throat. He did go into ER, they told him to just keep drinking fluids, that there was nothing else they could really do. When he was seen in the emergency room they gave him Benadryl and a steroid: Prednisone for now which he is on for the next couple of days. He was told that after 2 days or something, that after getting injected that he wouldn&#39;t have any symptoms-but he is still having those pretty severe symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Initial onset of anaphylactic shock was about 3-5 minutes after Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot was administered. Within 10-15 minutes he had swelling of tongue and throat and difficulty breathing. They called an ambulance, the ambulance took him to the Hospital emergency room where he was admitted and discharged that same date on 19May2021 after about 5-6 hours; he reported discharge time was around 16:40. They told him to come back if he had any issues that occurred over next couple of days or worsening or causing problems; to call back the nurses line. He was on a lot of Benadryl, a lot of antihistamines. When he gets off the antihistamines almost all the allergic reactions of the anaphylactic shock reoccur. This morning, 21May2021, he didn&#39;t take any Bendaryl before bed, and this morning when he woke up he was alright. After being at work like 30 minutes he felt the itchiness; scratchy throat; swelling of tongue; a little swelling of the throat; difficulty breathing. He took Benadryl and called the hotline who told him to call the Emergency room, he called the emergency room and went there. He talked to them this morning because he went to work and had issues breathing. He called and they told him to come in asap, so he went in to the emergency room; they gave him Benadryl and told him there was nothing else they could do other than him taking the steroid: Prednisone. The patient was in the hospital 3 days and will be day 4 tomorrow. He was trying to figure out how long this will last. They told him to talk to his doctor. They basically told him they were not responsible. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her son received the shot Wed 19May2021. Does not know if the Walgreen&#39;s reported this. He left there in an ambulance within 10 minutes of getting the shot. They took him to the emergency room and he got mixed information. He went back again today. They blew him off and told him maybe it was something he ate. She assumed that an allergic reaction would be about 24 hours but this is day 3. She is scared he may be taking too much Benadryl. He said he felt like he needed something to drink. Said that his throat felt really thirsty. He went back inside since his throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up. They saw that his throat was swollen and they called the paramedics. Within 15 minutes they came and brought him to the emergency room.  Nobody had given him Epi. They were going to give it to him an Epi pen  but he wanted to wait for the paramedics. He was freaking out. The paramedics showed up and they were unable to give him Epi, stating he didn&#39;t have hives. He only received Benadryl. They he had to have to give him extra Benadryl because whatever they gave him in the IV because the first didn&#39;t work and his throat was still closing up. It made him feel like a drug addict asking for Benadryl.  She was not sure if they gave him Benadryl in the ambulance, knows that it was given in the emergency room. The Benadryl may have been started in the ambulance but she is not sure. They did give him oxygen in the ambulance. Clarified he was in the ER over 4 hours, but was not admitted to the hospital. They gave him steroids but forgot to send him home with steroids. He had to call to find out about getting them and they told him they forgot to send the prescription in. He was late starting the next dose of steroids. He went back to the ER today, day 3. He didn&#39;t feel too bad today and went to work. After exerting a little energy and moving around, his throat started to do it again. He didn&#39;t have Benadryl on him. He left work because he thought it was going to close up again the day he got the shot. Once he calmed down, he took Benadryl. He called the hospital to ask if this was  normal. He was told that it is not normal and was told that if he still felt bad, to come to the hospital. They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses. He spoke to one of the doctors. They had never shown him how to use an ePi pen. He does not know how long this will last. He gets scared. Treatment: Has only been taking Benadryl. He started the steroids yesterday and today. They had given him Benadryl today in the ER and he is home now. The patient visited to the Emergency room twice, first time by ambulance, confirmed he was not admitted. He was pretty devastated. The outcome of events was unknown.
