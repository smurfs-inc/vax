Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

He got the shot, I filled out his card, and directed him and his mom to sit in the waiting area for 15 mins in case of dizziness or a reaction. They were walking out of the room to the waiting area and he almost immediately fainted. He fell and possibly hit his head on the chair/ floor when he went down. (This was maybe 2 mins post-injection). He almost looked like he was going to have a seizure (arms were tensed up, his eyes were not focused, was starting to shake) but then he suddenly came-to. He seemed to be pretty coherent after he woke back up but 911 was called since he was bleeding

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less.

He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized.

On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post vaccine, mom alerts the pharmacist that patient is experience some visual disturbances. The patient states that he felt dizzy/eyes were &#34;going black&#34; in and out. Heavier breathing than normal. States it feels harder to breath, but no reports of swelling or itching. Also states that ears were ringing. Pharmacist attempted to check blood pressure on patients left arm with an automatic cuff, but the machine errored twice. Then attempted to check BP with a manual cuff. Reading was varied due to patient moving his arm and hard to hear. Seemed to be around 90/50, but not precise. After 10 minutes, patient stated he was starting to feel better, just felt thirsty. Pharmacist rechecked BP on right arm with a different automatic cuff and reading was 104/62, with a pulse of 101. Patient continued to improve, stating that visual disturbances were gone and hearing had returned to normal. Was able to stand and walk around without feeling dizzy. No difficulty breathing reported at that time. Patient and mom waited another 5 minutes to ensure he had no symptoms and then were able to leave approximately 25 minutes post vaccine.

Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

During this time, pt started to report seeing purple lights at approximately 0957.  Vitals were attempted at 0954 but pt started seizing.  At 1001 pt reported total vision loss.  At this time, EMT&#39;s arrived on site and began to obtain vitals.  Pt&#39;s BP was 50/30, EMT&#39;s started an IV and prepared pt for transport to gurney.  At 1008 pt reported sight returning.  8L of 02 were applied to pt via non-rebreather at approximately 1000 at which pt&#39;s 02 sats registered at 72%.    EMT&#39;s placed pt on gurney at 1008 and started en route to Hospital.  Prior to seizure activity, pt&#39;s medical hx, medication list, and allergies were confirmed with pt&#39;s father.

The patient and mother walked to the waiting room for the 15 minute waiting period, approximately 5 minutes later the patients mother called out for help as the patient passed out. The patient was awake when I arrived but eyes were rolling slightly. he was breathing and pulse was present, we called 911 to be on the safe side. Approximately two minutes after calling 911 the patient basically snapped out of it, knew where he was, knew the date and the day of the week. EMS evaluated the patient and  the mother had informed the EMS that he had just got done mowing the lawn before his appointment , the weather here is extremely hot and humid so I don&#39;t know if related to that as well but wanted to provide all information known.

I talked to the patient and mother who reported a history of anxiety that may be contributing. They asked if he could lay down in the vaccine room and upon entering he lost his balance and fell to his knees but did not get injured or lose consciousness. The patient said he was not hurt but I called 911. they arrived about 15 minutes later and evaluated the patient. The patient revealed he had ran 2 miles earlier that day and had nothing to eat or drink besides a Yoo-hoo all day. The EMTs said he was very dehydrated. The patient felt fine after another 10 minutes and the mother declined medical transport.

                                                Exactly seven days after patient second vaccine, he boarded a 9:10AM flight, with his Dad and sister. Approximately 90 minutes into the flight, as patient watched a movie on his phone (which did not have a photosensitivity warning), he blacked out and doesn&#39;t remember anything else until after coming out of a seizure. What others saw, including his father (my husband), was a convulsing 16 year-old (nearly 6&#39; tall and 155 pounds), who was sitting just in front of him, between two strangers. My husband quickly realized what was happening and was totally surprised and struck with some fear, as we have NEVER seen a seizure in our family or in patient before (we have six biological children). The airline called for medical help; a doctor and some other professionals came. My husband had EMT training many years ago, so didn&#39;t hold patient body, but did work a few times to keep his head up (patient was seated), so as not to allow the airway to close. Patient sister (age 18) was across the aisle, alone, watching all of the commotion take place, not knowing what to do or how to help, in tears, but handling it with poise and independence. After about 2-3 minutes, the intense convulsing stopped, and his seizure became quieter but still had movement. His eyes were rolled back and he was foaming a bit at the mouth. He was still not responsive. This went on for about 4-5 minutes. Then he stopped. His dad and the doctor asked him basic questions like, &#34;who are you?&#34; &#34;how old are you?&#34; &#34;where are you?&#34; He couldn&#39;t answer any other those. Another 3-5 minutes past, and finally he was able to answer &#34;where are you?&#34; with &#34;I&#39;m right here.&#34; Slowly, he came back to his &#34;senses&#34; but of course, was very tired and had a horrible headache afterward. The doctor and my husband decided it was best to have the plane divert to another city  to get patient to a hospital as soon as possible. The three of them had to cancel their trip (work trip for my husband, which our 18- and 16-year-old children were accompanying him on for pleasure and travel). The Airlines was awesome about the whole thing. When the plane landed, they quickly escorted the three off the plane (patient walked slowly, then was put in a wheelchair when they got right off the plane). They were then transferred into an Ambulance and emergently sent to the Hospital. After several hours of waiting and testing, and patient not having any more seizure activity, his CT scan, blood tests, and chest x-ray were normal,  so he was discharged with the instruction to get an MRI with and without contrast upon arrival back home, and then to follow up with a Neurologist. He has been home nearly a week now and feels like himself. He has had the MRI, which came back normal (yay!), but we are waiting to see a Neurologist at hospital. The ONLY thing in patient life that had changed for him in the days, weeks, months preceding this super surprising event, was his Covid #2 Pfizer vaccine. That is why we, and our supportive doctor, are suspicious that this may have been the cause. We are a little nervous about whether or not more seizures will take place, or perhaps his body is done dealing with his probably strong reaction to the immunologic/inflammatory variable. Maybe altitude could have played in, along with the vaccine, and been the straws that broke the camel&#39;s back of other things maybe brewing? But we don&#39;t think so. patient has had NO health issues, other than an appendix out 3 years ago! Thanks for listening. We want this variable to you as a data point.

                                                6/3/21 at 1230 pm: Sudden onset of right arm numbness progressing to transient blurry vision, difficulty walking, right lower extremity weakness, difficulty moving his mouth, stuttering,  imbalance, and right sided facial droop.   He was admitted to hospital on 6/4/21. Found to have a demyelinating process (see imaging report below). He received IVIG treatment and IV steroids with some (but incomplet)e improvement and was discharged to Rehab on 6/16/21 on oral steroids. However, he had recurrence and progression of symptoms and was sent back to hospital on 6/19/21 with worsening right sided hemiplegia. He underwent repeat high dose IV steroids and initiation of plasmapharesis. He has currently (as of 6/25/21) completed 3 of 5 runs of plasmapharesis with marked improvement in symptoms but still has significant right sided motor deficits.   Neurologists here now feel comfortable making a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. He will likely be discharging home for ongoing therapy and treatment after he completes plasmapharesis  on 6/28/21.

Patient was getting restless and started asking to leave ~13 minutes after shot. I said ?no, we need to wait the full 15 minutes they recommend?. About on minute later, or ~14 minutes after shot, Patient said he felt like he was going to pass out. As I turned my head to look at him to began to slump towards me unconscious and I held him up by his shoulder and waved the paramedics over. He was unconscious with eyes closed for about 5 seconds and by the time the paramedics got there his eyes were fluttering, but he remained unresponsive for another ~10-15 seconds as they were calling his name, tapping his shoulder, and asking him questions. Then he finally came around and, while groggy, he was able to answer questions. He sat there a couple minutes talking to paramedics and they had wheelchair, but he said he could walk and got up slowly to walk slowly back to clinic area.

A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot number: unknown) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 29May2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 16-year-old) as a dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization at Pharmacy or Drug Store. Medical history of the patient was not reported. Patient had no known allergies. Patient did not receive any other medications (concomitant) within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 06Jun2021 (Sunday) at 08:00, patient started having severe ringing in his ear and could not hear. His parent took him to urgent care on June 9 and patient was prescribed a steroid, nothing changed after a week. Appointment was Scheduled with ENT where they did hearing test and said patient has significant hearing loss. Patient was getting an MRI tomorrow and going back to ENT to get a steroid shot in his ear to see if they can restore hearing loss. They mentioned they did have other patients that received COVID vaccine and now have hearing loss but are not 16 and were much older than patient (reporter son). They told us not to get second vaccine shot. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit along with visit to Emergency room/department or urgent care. The event as serious [Seriousness criteria-Disabling/Incapacitating]. Device date was 17Jun2021. Patient received steroid as a corrective treatment. Outcome of the events were not resolved on an unspecified date.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and fainted approximately  minute after the dose was given. The patient&#39;s eyes rolled back as he fell to the floor where it appears that he had a mini seizure. We called for a code white and immediately began emergency procedures. I held the patient while he was sitting upright and kept speaking to him until he regain consciousness approximately 1 minute after he had syncope.  The patient seemed very confused because he had asked the question &#34;where am I,&#34; as he opened his eyes. He slowly became more alert as time passed by and was aware of his surroundings within the next 2 minutes.  He then stated that he was hot and hungry and was given water (from me) and Gatorade from his mother at his request. It was not long after that that the patient fully recovered and was back to normal. I had them stay and observed him for at least 40 minutes just to make sure that he was ok. Statements were taken from a salaried member of management during this time.  There was no medication needed and none given during this incident. Plans were made with patient&#39;s mother for a follow up and our contact information was given incase they needed to contact us for anything at all. I will reach out to them in the next 1-2 days to see how the patient is progressing.

July 7 headache worse and nausea. July 8 headache so severe could not walk without pain shooting down back and pain with neck motion. Vomited 4 times and had to wear sun glasses even inside due to eye sensitivity. Patient had no fever no sore throat or cough. When he presented to the ED his neurological exam was normal but had mild nuchal rigidity/photophobia/and moderate severe headache.  As we worked him up the consideration was vaccine reaction versus viral meningitis. We gave him Toradol and Compazine as we awaited his test results and he felt significantly better. I was going to do a lumbar puncture if he was not improved. He ate and drank gatorade with  no nausea and was discharged with orders to return if symptoms worsened. He was instructed to see his doctor if not well in 3-4 days.

Within  seconds, his head fell back and his eye had rolled to the back of his head.  The patient was caught by the administering pharmacist and asked for assistance.  The patient was placed on his back and allowed to gradually get his bearings.  The patient&#39;s mom states he has experienced fainting following or during other medical treatments since the age of 6.   The patient was given water, and after about 30 minutes felt well enough to leave the store with his mom.

A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EW0196), via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm(shoulder) on 14Jun2021 16:00 (age at vaccination: 16 years) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for just to get it to make sure he is fully protected. Vaccination Facility Type was reported as Pharmacy/Drug Store. The patient medical history included he had SVT and artery flutter that was diagnosed late in his 14 turning to 15. States they are fully resolved. Relays that he had 3 heart surgeries, each one you have to wait 6 months to get done. States the 1st one they couldn&#39;t find anything, the 2nd one they cauterized nerve endings, and the 3rd one they found another heart condition and did the same thing, they cauterized the nerve endings inside his heart. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was reported as none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks)or any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine was reported as none. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was reported as none. The patient Concomitant medications included ibuprofen(IBUPROFEN ABECE)taken for numbness from Jun2021. On 01Jul2021, the patient experienced Swollen tonsils at his appointment about 1:30pm, feels a little hot, last night he felt weird and then used the bathroom and felt better. On an unspecified date in Jul2021, the patient experienced sleeping now and that is a warning flag for him sleeping a lot, told to hold off and wait on getting the 2nd dose, he wants to have him evaluated 1st to see if it is an infection or an allergic reaction and he came home tired and fell asleep. On 15Jun2021, the patient experienced numbness in his arm. The other symptoms (except swollen tonsils) started around 8 PM-9 PM after their walk 1Jul2021.It was reported that he had heart complications(heart issues) 2 years ago which are resolved now. He received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine on 14Jun2021 and he&#39;s scheduled for his second dose on 05Jul2021. Yesterday he went to his orthodontist and was diagnosed with swelling in his tonsils (first she said one of them and his tongue, then she explained that the swelling was in his tonsils). She would like to know if there are reports of any swollen glands and if she should be concerned about it. The reporter(who is patient&#39;s mom) stated that she just talked to the patients pediatrician and was told to hold off and wait on getting the 2nd dose, he wants to have him evaluated 1st to see if it is an infection or an allergic reaction. She states the lymph nodes are tonsils and they need to make sure it is not an allergic reaction and also not his heart and was told if it gets worse to take him to the Emergency Room and it&#39;s kind of off, like she saw them and they are really huge and it&#39;s just weird. She states he weighs about 205-210 pounds and is maybe 5 foot 7 inches tall. He just saw the orthodontist and received a letter to see his doctor and something clicked in her head that they are glands and basically anything like that vaccine have that type of reaction and he feels a little hot that started 01Jul2021 and last night he felt weird and then used the bathroom and felt better. Caller relays that he is sleeping now and that is a warning flag for him sleeping a lot. States that started recently and she tried to take him for exercising yesterday on nature walk and he came home tired and fell asleep. States he stayed up 1-2 hours and fell asleep. Caller states another orthodontist and pediatrician never have said anything about his tonsils before. Caller states she has to watch him, he will say he doesn&#39;t feel anything but that was the heart condition and he would go into shock and fall on the floor and she has to monitor him and he didn&#39;t know he was having episodes and they would reset his heart with paddles. Caller states she will probably take him to the ER and have tests run. The Relevant Tests was reported as None. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of Swelling in his tonsils, numbness in his arm. The outcome of the event numbness in his arm, feels a little hot in his arm was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 16-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presents to the emergency department with concerns for chest pain and shortness of breath.  Patient had his second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine 3 days ago.  Initially after the dose he did experience some myalgias, fatigue, and a sore throat.  The symptoms lasted overnight and into the following day.  They then remitted.  Yesterday, patient was feeling well in the morning, however, in the evening he began to experience significant shortness of breath.  This shortness of breath along with some anterior throat and upper chest discomfort with deep respirations.  He denied any associated nausea, vomiting, or sweating.  With these symptoms he went to hospital.  There he was evaluated and a chest x-ray was performed.  Patient&#39;s chest x-ray did not show any concerning findings.  Patient was discharged in stable condition with albuterol and encouraged to follow-up with his primary care physician.   Today, patient&#39;s shortness of breath and chest pain returned.  He states that it is in the center of her chest with occasional radiation to his jaw.  He denies any associated nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  His pain was initially severe in route to the emergency department, however, it has lessened and is now 4 out of 10 in severity.  Patient otherwise denies any other fevers, lightheadedness, change in vision, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or dysuria.  Medical Decision Making: Pt presented for chest pain.  EKG was given to me shortly after obtaining it.  This showed ST elevation inferiorly and laterally with possible reciprocal change in I, aVL &amp; V1.  Troponin was markedly elevated.  I discussed case with our interventional cardiologist initially who wanted to take pt to the cath lab.  However, pt is a minor and he noted that he couldn&#39;t cath a minor.  This decision was made after the patient was already in the cath lab.  Therefore, I contacted Hospital and discussed this case with the on call cardiologist.  He recommended pt be tranferred to the ED where they will evaluate him and possibly do an echo of his heart.  I discussed this with the ED physician at hospital who agreed to see pt.  He was then tranferred via ambulance for further care.

                                                10 days after receiving the first shot my son noticed blurred, wavy vision in his Right eye.  We took him to the eye doctor the next day where his vision was 20/60 in that eye and they found a spot on the back of his retina.  We were referred to a Retina Specialist. We saw Dr. two times where they determined he had had inflammation in the back of his eye and scar tissue was now in the place where the inflammation had been.  We were told surgery would be needed to remove scar tissue and hopefully correct his vision a few lines.  We decided to get a second opinion since we still didn&#39;t have any answers regarding what caused this to happen, if it was going to get worse and if he could possibly get it in his other eye.  We just saw another Dr. where he confirmed that surgery was necessary to try to repair damage.  His vision at this appointment was 20/100.  They do believe it is stable but has fluctuated between 20/60 and 20/100.  Dr. mentioned that he has another patient about the same age who had the same thing happen at about the same time as our son&#39;s eye condition began.  I have since also found several cases around the world with similar experiences.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Second dose of Pfizer vaccine received Friday afternoon (4/2/2021). Went to bed Friday evening with &#34;normal&#34; side effects of mild fever and sore arm at injection site. Woke up Saturday morning with no sense of smell or taste. Called primary care provider who conducted a video visit and expressed concern that he may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 prior to injection (no symptoms displayed at all in weeks prior). Order a COVID test for Sunday morning. Woke up Sunday morning with sense of taste and smell back. Proceeded with PCR test, which came back as &#34;negative&#34; on Sunday evening. No other symptoms observed, and other side effects noted above (sore arm, fever) resolved by Sunday morning as well. Seems to suggest loss of sense of taste and smell likely due to vaccine since there was a clear temporal relationship which resolved in approximately 24 hours.

                                                On the evening of 4/11/21, pt. suddenly had trouble hearing and had tinnitus in his left ear.  He reports it felt clogged/stuffy &#34;like being on an airplane&#34; as well.  He saw an ENT the morning of 4/12/21.  The doctor cleared wax from pts. ear and an audiologist performed a hearing test.  The results showed a loss of 50% of hearing in his left ear along with tinnitus.  His diagnosis was sudden sensorineural hearing loss.  Pt. was given an Rx for prednisone, valtrex and N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine for two weeks, which he started on 4/12/21.   Dr. ordered an MRI with contrast of pts. internal auditory canals which will be performed on 4/21/21.  Dr. referred pt to another ENT who pt. saw on 4/16/21.  Drs. audiologist performed another hearing test which showed some improvement in hearing in the left ear but no improvement in the tinnitus.  Dr. injected steroids through pts. left eardrum to the space behind it.  Pt. will have additional injections on 4/23/21 and 4/30/21.   As of today, 4/18/21, pt. reports that his hearing is worse and the tinnitus has not improved.

                                                The day after the vaccination started hives.  But it was slow so thought could be food allergic reaction. Over a period of 2 weeks it developed never went off.  Noticing the hives   getting worse and the epsode starting day after vaccination suspected it the cause and so went to primary care physician.  She diagnosed the hives related to medical side effects and only medical related item he had within the last 1 year was this vaccine.  She put him on Methylprednisolone for 6 days along with Cetirizine HCL 10mg.  The hives appeared to be suppressed for the first 3 days where the dose was higher, however, when the dosage was getting lower after day 3 it came back with high intensity.  Lips, fingers, tongue...swollen and with fever running at upto 101.6.  Again went to the doctor, she put him on Prednisone with 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10mg for 3 days and 10mg alternate days.  It literally took more than 1 and half month still not recovered.  Hives are still on and also severe cold with mucus and cough started since (05/09/21).  Fever show up on and off even now.  We&#39;re referred to allergy specialists.  She asked to not take 2nd dose.  Increased dosage of Antihistamines, asked to continue Prednisone 10mg for 6 more day daily 10mg and if cold and cough does go in the next 2 days may put on antibiotics.

It used to be at about a 2 out of 10 but now it is like a 7 or 8 out of 10. My hearing has also become super sensitive. So sensitive to the point where talking with someone at medium volume hurts my ears.  So sensitive that daily things that used to be no problem are now unbearable loud.

Patient became nauseous. While in the vehicle to go home, patient&#39;s breathing quickened. After this, patient&#39;s vision became blurry and he was unable to see. Patient also experienced hearing loss with ringing in ears. The father of the patient pulled the car over in case medical attention was needed. Patient eventually passed out for about 30 seconds (about 4:22). Patient recovered, but complained about fogginess (thinking was unclear and unfocused). The next day, on 5/12/21, the patient experienced chills and nausea without a fever. Currently, the patient is doing fine with no further symptoms.

                                                Pt was seen at ED on5/8 for L sided weakness in the setting of a headache. Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

Mom caught him and called for help and reported his eyeballs rolled up and he started down when she caught him. by time Pharmacist and store staff got there (less than a minute) he had regained consciousness but very lightheaded. No breathing difficulty. So got a chair and had him sit with head down and store staff observing. After another 10min he still reported lightheaded and nausea, so ambulance was called. When they arrived and checked him out everything checked out normal and he was feeling better so they released him to his parents care. Called on 5/24/21 at 10:10am and spoke to mom who reported he was doing fine and no apparent after effects.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

This occurred about 5-10 min following vaccination. Most likely a vasovagal syncope reaction. No history of allergic reactions nor syncope. After laying  patient down and elevating his legs, he felt much better. Patient remained in this position for about 15 minutes. He then sat up, ate a snack, and drank water and was observed for an additional 15 minutes. Vitals were within normal range. Patient stated feeling&#34;normal&#34; and &#34;fine&#34; after this and he was able to go home without additional issues.

                                                On 4/6 my son noticed changes with his vision which continued to 4/7 at which time we brought him to his pcp. She referred us to his eye doctor. They got him in that afternoon, did an exam, told us to follow up that Friday. At the 4/9 follow up he was diagnosed with sixth nerve palsy on the left eye. We scheduled a MRI and lab work. Lab work came back fine. He went for the MRI on 4/16. The MRI showed several brain lesions pointing towards MS. We went to a medical center on 4/20 where they thought the finding lesion were incidental and not related to MS. We saw a neuro-opthamologist on 4/21, who said he felt my son did have MS with sixth nerve palsy. We saw a neurologist on the afternoon of 4/21 who said patient didn&#39;t meet the criteria of MS and to follow up another MRI in 3 months. That weekend patient started with areas on numbness. He was due for second covid injection which all providers agreed with us getting. He got his second dose on 4/24 during this flare of numbness. We went back the neurologist on 4/26. Patient was given a three day iv steroid infusion, lab work and follow up MRI. The follow up MRI showed more lesions in his brain which lead us to the neurologist in another state. Dr reviewed both MRIs, felt the lesions were incidental, the flare of numbness as well at the sixth nerve palsy of his eye were related to inflammation related to the vaccine he received.

A 17-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, #lot: EN6200) via intramuscular route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 17-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus, ADHD, known allergies: cats and horses, acne and depression. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood immunoglobulin g: negative, blood immunoglobulin m: negative, herpes simplex test: negative. Acyclovir (stopped when HSV 1 and 2 IgG and IgM were neg), sars-cov-2 test: negative on 24Feb2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included insulin lispro (HUMALOG) and isotretinoin (ACCUTANE). On 22Feb2021, the patient developed severe swollen glands in his submand region, throat pain, swollen lymph nodes in groin, dehydration, oral lesions, oral ulcers and severely fissured lips, lethargy and body aches. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received for all the events. Hydration, discontinued Accutane, gave Acyclovir (stopped when HSV 1 and 2 IgG and IgM were neg). The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                The minor patient was at the pharmacy to receive a second Pfizer Covid vaccination.  Upon review he stated he had experienced dizziness with previous vaccinations years ago, but never fainted.  The technician administered the vaccine and the father knocked on the window to get my attention.  I ran out front as the patient was stating his vision was becoming blurry.  The technician and I lowered him to the ground as he lost consciousness.  We elevated his feet and he immediately regained consciousness.  He started to stand and we advised him to remain seated.  We laid him back down and after several minutes he requested water which was given.  A few minutes later he was able to stand and took a seat in the waiting area for 30 minutes.  He was feeling better and had no other compaints.

                                                Within minutes of shot, my son had a seizure. He complained of tingling in left arm, then he couldn?t hear anything and had blurred vision, and said he had an extreme headache. Within moments he began convulsions that became stronger and his whole body was shaking. This lasted for about 45 seconds. He stopped shaking and began to wake up. He was groggy and confused and said he didn?t remember anything, but the pain in his head subsided. 911 was called and they took him to the hospital to check his vitals. They could not be sure what brought on Seizure. Suggested Vagol Response. We went home. That evening he felt tingles and needles in body, we thought side affect of vaccine. Today, he was in extreme pain from pins and needles sensations throughout his body.

                                                Patient was nervous about getting vaccine. Discussed safety profile of vaccine and that many people are tolerating very well. Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

                                                Vision problem. My son has been a homeschooled student for many years, using computer for his schooling without any problems. He had a minor injury to one eye shortly before the vaccination (scratched with hand), but after the shot, he complained of vision problems in both eyes. Redness, dryness, pressure, uncomfortable. Unable to concentrate and stay reading for more than a few minutes at a time. His primary doctor is now treating with antibiotic drops, but will take him to the eye doctor if he does not get better by Thursday as he will be done with the eye drops. We have also added allergy medicine, which seems to help a little. He is due for his second shot on 4/29. I still need him to get the shot to be protected from Covid, so hopefully, he will be better.

                                                After the first dose, I experienced tinnitus about every day for a week or two afterwards. The tinnitus would be present in one or both ears and last about 5-10 minutes. Illness set in roughly 30 min after the second dose. Illness has lasted throughout the last 4 days, and even through today. This would indicate the vaccine has made me ill for about 5 days now. Caused me to go to the doctor as I assumed the reaction couldn&#39;t be from the vaccine so long after the dose.

He was aware that they were not real during and after he had them, but it was a nonetheless disturbing experience.  He described to me having the need to hydrate all night and he drank a lot of water. This morning he was still having a headache and numbness as well as overall malaise, but has taken advil and eaten a light breakfast. He is dressed and up and around and seems to be improving. Should the symptoms return or worsen, we plan to take him for medical care.

On an unspecified date in May2021, the patient had periodic pins and needles with the numbness, difficulty sleeping, chest tightness periodically, but not consistently, chest pain, severe fatigue, ear ringing, general malaise, can&#39;t walk to the end of the block without coming back in pain, found it hard to concentrate and cloudy head.   It was reported that the caller&#39;s son had the pain but it did not go across his chest like after the first dose Pfizer Covid 19 vaccination. The caller&#39;s son had numbness down his arms and legs and her son&#39;s legs were real heavy. The caller&#39;s son had to help life his legs to get his legs to move.

At that point I stayed with the patient and called for my pharmacist. The patient lost consciousness, and by the time my pharmacist got there he was stable and coherent. Once my pharmacist assessed the situation she had me call 911 for paramedics.  We had him lay on the floor with a pillow under his head, feet elevated.  We provided ice water, nuts as a snack, and I dabbed sweat from his forehead while holding an ice pack to his forehead. I stayed with the patient and patients girlfriend until paramedics arrived for transport.

                                                symptoms began as blurry vision, extreme light sensitivity (couldn&#39;t open eyes because of pain), and severe headache.  He also had what looked like a red rash or blood bruise on both eyelids.  The symptoms got increasingly worse and his vision became completely blurry and he was unable to focus his eyes and his photosensitivity so severe that he had to be in a dark room, even when his eyes were closed.  His headache increased.  We initially went to an urgent care clinic where they ran bloodwork, and then we were sent to an eye specialist for a thorough exam, which was excruciating for him to sit through on account of having to examine his eyes open and with light.  After a few hours at the eye specialist we went home and he went to bed, unable to sleep because of his extreme headache.  The symptoms lasted the following day, and the day after with loss of visual focus, extreme headache, and the rash on his eyelids appeared to had gotten a bit worse.  I would say that Saturday evening his eyesight began getting gradually better (vaccine on Wednesday evening).  His headache and aversion to sound continued.  Over the next week his vision began gradually getting better, different eyes at different rates, as well as his headache.   He still has the rash on his eyelids.

He slumped over and passed out for approximately 3-5 seconds.  He came back to a little, was diaphoretic and breathing shallowly.  Mom was worried and we called the paramedics.  Mother said he hadn&#39;t been out of the house in about 3 years and had anxiety about the shot.  Paramedics asked if he wanted to go to the hospital with them and he refused.  Mother informed us he doesn&#39;t have a PCP.

He passed out and was helped to a sitting position.  When I was called out to the lobby patient was still feeling a little lightheaded but he was conscious and breathing normally.  He sustained a small cut on his hand which we cleaned up promptly.  Patient told mom he felt like his vision was  blurry.  Mom wanted him checked out so I called emergency help.

Sat down he started to sweat profusely. Told him to take his sweatshirt off. Continues to sweat his forehead his T-shirt was wet his back was wet. Then he tilted his head back his eyes rolled back into his head. I called the nurse. We got him to a wheelchair and behind the curtain. Before we had a chance to put him on the Exam Table he passed out and started to seize for the count of 3 or 4 seconds. Then he woke up. He said he saw white beautiful light. I am not kidding. He does not joke. Then he said he was fine. Insisted he was fine.  His bp was low for the first two readings. Then It came back up to normal. He laid flat for 15 more min. Had some juice. Sat up when It was gone to go. Bp got super high. We waited till It was normal and left.

Taken to stretcher, BP: 126/74, HR: 61, RR: 16 nonlabored, SaO2: 98% on RA. H/o tree nut allergy - mouth swelling. To ED via w/c. 1310: report to nurse. 1315: c/o HA at this time, no change in vision sx, with nurse.    ED Note: A 19 y.o. male with a history of multiple prior RUE surgeries and tree nut allergy who presents with blurred vision. In the ED, he is very well appearing and in NAD. VS WNL. On physical exam, he is neurovascularly intact. On ophthalmalgic exam, his pupils at 5 mm bilaterally briskly reactive (does have some light sensitivity), painless full EOM, normal visual fields. On my testing of visual acuity, mildly decreased in the left; however on Doctor it is was mildly decreased in the right. Overall no significant deficit in visual acuity. Patient denies ocular trauma. No ocular pain. Sclera/conjunctiva is not injected.    I feel presentation is most likely an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Not consistent with allergic reaction. Overall his examination is reassuring against an acute ocular emergency. Patient does also state that his symptoms are improving. Received Benadryl in triage. Will report and call Pfizer, poison control, and ophtho.

                                                severe dehydration; severe dehydration; thirst; could not sleep at night/ lack of sleep/ sleep interrupted; she had never heard him so anxious or disturbed that he could not get relief; she had never heard him so anxious or disturbed that he could not get relief; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (medical technologist). A 19-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandson) received BNT61B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not reported), on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 19-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic (since 1 years old, he was diagnosed 1 week after getting the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine), dehydrated and rapid heartbeat (patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included insulin for diabetic. The patient previously received measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. The reporter (caller) mentioned that his grandson got the 1st dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021. Several hours later (04Mar2021), he experienced severe dehydration and thirst and could not sleep at night. He was very very uncomfortable and usually did not complain regarding experiences. He was young and going to college and he was living on his own. He was also diabetic. She was worried about his safety regarding his intake of the 2nd dose, so she was wondering if this had been reported and for any recommendations before and after getting the 2nd dose. They were consulting with his endocrinologist and the nurse at the endocrinologist&#39;s clinic said that they recommend young diabetic people to drink tons of water when getting the vaccine. Caller mentioned that she herself got the Pfizer vaccine and had no problem with it. Caller mentioned that his Grandson was diabetic since 1 years old. He was diagnosed 1 week after getting the MMR vaccine. She also mentioned that his grandson just recently got in college and he was in the younger side of the spectrum. Caller is asking if there is any data that would include her grandson&#39;s conditions in the clinical trials. Caller stated she was calling about the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and stated her grandson who was the patient was the one who received his first dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021 and that day he received the vaccine he told her that starting in the evening that same day (04Mar2021) she had never heard him so anxious or disturbed that he could not get relief and the adverse reaction he had was severe dehydration and thirst and it was giving him a fit. Caller stated she thinks he was probably 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; in height or so and thinks he weighed around and between 175-180 pounds when she last asked him. Caller stated she was not an HCP but was a medical technologist calling on behalf of the patient and because she was a medical technologist, she is medically trained. Caller stated she had not been able to get back in touch with the patient to get all the details for the report before she called around to get help but also stated the patient had his sleep interrupted after the vaccine was administered and he could not sleep but thinks this is all resolved and must have been resolved but she couldn&#39;t say for certain how long that he could not sleep or how long the severe dehydration or thirst lasted but she can find out. Caller stated the patient had not yet had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and had his patient card and stated she did not have the lot, expiry date or NDC for the first dose. Caller stated for the indication for which the patient was administered the COVID vaccine, she thought because the patient was diabetic and the HCP was very anxious for him to have defense against COVID and against all various types of virus or the school may have required it but she was not sure; states it was for the patient&#39;s own safety that his endocrinologist wanted him to have the vaccine. Caller stated that the patient did not have treatment for the reported event and he did not say to her that he had any treatment; caller stated she doubted the infirmary at his school is even open at the University and she did not know whether the patient would go to the infirmary or not. Caller stated she was calling to find out of there have been any reports or feedback on this reaction that the patient had or the adverse situation the patient had several hours after receiving the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; states specifically for the severe dehydration and thirst the patient experienced after being administered the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated the patient was due to get his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine three weeks from 04Mar2021 and she was most anxious to find out what recommendations were given or if Pfizer heard complaints about other adverse events like the ones she was reporting on the patient. Caller stated the patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat and he was with his father at that time; no further details provided by the caller. Caller stated the patient reported this to her in conversation a day or so after he had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and she is medically trained and it has been a long time since she used that medical training but the patient is diabetic since the age of 1 and he had good care and has been under the care of the hospital endocrinologist and his HCP since he was found to have diabetes and he uses his insulin pump very well. Caller stated the patient was off to college where very few were attending college and the patient had a very undesirable evening after the vaccine of lack of sleep and he was so thirsty and could not get hydrated and she knows dehydration is bad for anybody even if they aren&#39;t diabetic or if they have a life threatening type of illness but the patient was at school and did not have a family member to help take care of him and he was due for his 2nd shot three weeks from 04Mar2021. Caller stated she was trying to find out the best route for him to go report this and she told him to report the reaction to the HCP and to call the HCP who prescribed the vaccine; stated the patient&#39;s endocrinologist was not able to get in touch with the patient and he was not answering the phone; stated the patient is at college and he was on online courses. Caller stated she was very anxious to find out enough information about this and it is a concern to his treating physician and she was asking about recommendations about the patient not having his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; stated she spoke with the nurse that works with the endocrinologist for all of these 18 years they have cared for the patient. Caller states the HCP&#39;s nurse stated she had found that patients that receive the vaccine and have diabetes and are treated at the hospital they recommend that those patients drink tons and tons of water before having the vaccine because some types of people with diabetes have extreme thirst.  Caller stated she had no vaccine names, patient information or lot number or other information to provide on the patients that had the vaccine and have diabetes. Caller stated she spoke at the HCP office and stated there was no need for secrecy and HIPPA was not in Pfizer&#39;s domain; stated she cannot depend on the patient to look out for his own safety and she as a medical technologist used to give patients ordered glucose tolerance tests and she knew of the reactions that occurred with those patients and she did not want the patient to be stuck and wanted for him to do the smart thing of spending the night at home rather than drive back. Caller stated for those patients she administered glucose tests to she had no patient information or lot numbers or other information to provide and it was years ago before the Pfizer COVID vaccine came out. Caller stated she worked trying to get patient&#39;s diabetes under control at the University where she worked. Caller stated she already called and waited for organization but did not speak to anyone and left them a number to call her back a couple of days ago but she had not heard back; stated there were 18 people in the phone queue before her and she was hoping not to have to wait again. Caller stated her grandson probably does not had the time to wait on the phone being at college and he needed to do what he needed to do to be safe. Caller stated she had only spoken with the endocrinologist who treats the patient in his hometown and reported this information to the HCP&#39;s nurse and they are pretty good with follow up with patients. Caller stated she did not think the patient had other health issues and he actually had done extremely well on his insulin pump and had been on the insulin pump since about 3 years of age; stated she had no name of the insulin, had no lot numbers or further information. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm in muscle on 07May2021 17:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 19-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There was no medical history.   No family medical history relevant to events.  There were no concomitant medications.  No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 07May2021, his vision got all spotty and he could not see, pupils got bigger than normal after the vaccine, had blue lips, white face, blood pressure really dropped, and he lost vision at one time immediately afterwards, and he felt cold. The time of onset of events was around 5pm. Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. They stated they had given a thousand of this vaccine and this had never happened before. They stated they had never seen what happened to his son before. The patient did not get the second one yet and was told not to get it. All events happened a few minutes after the vaccine during the sitting/waiting period. About after 5 minutes the most after administration this all started and they had to treat him with an ammonia thing to wake him up. It&#39;s the one you break it under the nose and they were ready to do an Epi Pen also if needed. He improved within half an hour to 45 minutes of this. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Mentioned they all in his family did the Covid vaccine.  The patient improved and they advised him not to get the second one. It was Facility to tell them that. The pharmacist from there just gave them a call wanting to know why the son didn&#39;t return for the second dose and he explained what happened since this pharmacist did not know what happened that day. Patient did not see doctor or go to emergency room since his condition improved dramatically after about 45 minutes or so. Father kept asking patient how he felt or if there was need to see doctor and patient declined. The outcome of events was recovering.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I immediately rushed to his aid. PT stated  they felt like they were going to pass out. I provided the patient with water and a granola bar because he said he did not eat since 12 pm that day. Pt began to feel better after the water and snack.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

I saw some other people online had noticed this after their shot too, so I wanted to let y&#39;all know. When I got the shot at first, my arm really hurt at the site of the shot and as I walked back home afterwards, my whole left side felt weird. That evening, I was extraordinarily tired. Now I feel better, but that was a doozy

                                                Approximately three to four minutes after the second dose, he reported feeling dizzy. A few seconds later he lost consciousness with eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was unresponsive to verbal communication or attempts to shake him awake. He then began grunting and struggling for breath. His body began to shake/convulse and he lost control of his bladder. This lasted about five to ten seconds. He regained consciousness and reported that he felt as if he was &#34;dreaming&#34;. He also reported feeling very hot, and had sweat dripping down his face. Paramedics were called to the scene where his vital signs were checked. All signs including temperature were normal. His first dose on /26/21 had an almost exact reaction, minus losing control of bladder, although that time nobody was around to assist him.

                                                Patient asked to stay seated immediately following vaccination, as he has a needle phobia. Shortly after (roughly 5 minutes), patient said he felt extremely lightheaded and shaky. He accepted a glass of water, but after taking a few sips said his vision was starting to black in and out. 911 was called immediately. EMTs checked that patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate, and eventually concluded the patient was okay after giving him more water and a banana to eat.

                                                Pt  20year old male- came to the pharmacy for a walk in  covid vaccine. He filled out the vaccine consent form. I asked him if he was feeling ok today - he said yes. he presented as looking in healthy condition. I then asked him if he has ever had a bad reaction to a vaccine  and he said not that he knew of but that he did not like needles. I told him that was normal, explained the shot was a quick pinch no stinging and would be over before he knew it. I encouraged him to relax his arm muscle and as soon as he did I gave the vaccine. I started to tell him he could take Tylenol or ibuprofen if he should get  a sore arm and to make sure he is drinking plenty of water as hydration helps our bodies- he then asked if he could have some water and then tilted his head back and was passed out for i&#39;d say 4 seconds. I massaged his arm and neck as he became kinda ridged and talked him back. he was out for about 4 seconds. I yelled for our store co manager who happened to be close by to come to the pharmacy and call 911. When he regained consciousness he started to sweat. he said he felt cold and thirsty. I gave him some water to drink. I explained to him what had happened and told him that we had called 911 out of precaution. I discussed with him calling parents and he wanted to call himself - he made the call to his mom on his cell phone to have her come pick him up. EMS arrived in about 10 minutes. they said his blood pressure was really low 100/60 and wanted to take him in but the patient refused. he also refused getting his blood sugar tested as he now told us he was deathly afraid of any medical procedure. ems left. I offered him some more water and chips. he drank 2 full bottles of water and ate a small bag of chips. his mom showed up a few minutes later to drive him home- we explained to her what had happened.. I told her to monitor his blood pressure at home (she said she had a machine)she said she should have known better than to let him come alone as she knew he reacted bad to medical situations. He left about 30 minutes after he got his vaccine. walked out on his own needed no assistance.

A 20-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left (at the age of 20-years-old) on 02Jun2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR [SALBUTAMOL SULFATE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Nurse stated, Initially when he has a dose of the first dose like two three days after he was experiencing, he also had a muscle that was given, he had a muscle injection site was painful, that arm was sore that was given, but he also started experiencing shortness of breath and same left sided chest pressure and I called his pediatrician and that&#39;s why we are just watching him because it wasnt to the point where he was full blown shortness of breath, full blown chest pressure stayed last for a couple of days then getting it worst. But he had the chills, he had fatigue is still there and it started to subside and then couple days after since it subside, fatigue never left but then he started to get chills again and fatigue was even more pronounce and then started more congestion and then he has ear infection, which we took him to doctor 2 days ago and he has started antibiotics. So the whole time from the time he got the dose till now he is been not feeling good, so now with the antibiotics he is feeling a little better and on 04Jun or 05Jun, like Friday to Saturday he was expecting little shortness of breath and then he was having a little bit of left side chest pressure, he had the arm pain initially and the site of injection was really painful and then the fatigue probably started the same time Friday Saturday he just, he didn&#39;t looked good at all, he just looked white. The patient experienced left sided chest pressure (concern of myocarditis), like a chest pain on the left side, shortness of breath, chills on an wasn&#39;t feeling good with joint pain wasn&#39;t feeling good with joint pain/wasn&#39;t feeling good after he received the vaccine; not feeling well; whole time from the time he got the dose till now he is been not feeling good, fatigued/still feeling fatigued on an unspecified date, ear infection on 19Jun2021 and a lot of congestion, muscle injection site was painful, arm was sore; arm pain, the site of injection was really, muscle injection site was painful, arm was sore; arm pain, the site of injection was really painful, he didn&#39;t looked good at all, he just looked white on an unspecified date. The patient was treated with antibiotics for ear infection. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test result: negative. Caller stated His sons next dose (of Pfizer COVID vaccine) is due Wednesday. But until now he has not been feeling good. I don&#39;t want to give him the vaccine when he&#39;s sick. Does that make a difference with the effectiveness if I delay the second dose and she heard people had worse side effects for the first few days with fevers, body aches, nausea, fever and subsided and then they take their 2nd dose and are better after the 2nd dose, also stated her sons symptoms were not acute, but is not sure if it is coincidental if his ear infection was due to the vaccine. The outcome of the events were reported as unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event myocarditis cannot be totally excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient still has upper respiratory infection but has no fever now. The reporter down not want the patient to have the shot and have another problem. The reporter doesn&#39;t know if the events were due to the vaccine or maybe at the time the patient was starting to get the problem, it seems like it coincided. The reporter stated that the events started 3 weeks ago, on Jul2021. Currently, the ear infection was improving slightly. The patient went to work and was sent home since the co-workers were complaining that the patient was coughing which started on Jul2021. The patient&#39;s doctor won&#39;t let the patient come until he had a COVID test, so the patient went to urgent care, where the patient underwent a COVID-19 test on Jul2021 and saw a doctor there. About a week or later, the patient&#39;s doctor let him come since his COVID-19 test last Jul2021 was negative. The doctor saw the patient and because of no improvement of the patient&#39;s upper respiratory infection, the patient was put on steroids and was changed to stronger antibiotics. The reporter wanted to know if it was safe for the patient to take the second dose even if his symptoms are still ongoing. The events resulted in physician&#39;s office visit and therapeutic measures were given as a result of the events. Outcome of the event upper respiratory infection was not recovered, for ear infection was recovering, and for other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

This pit has been leaking fluid since 7:00 AM yesterday, on April 2. There is a mild, numbing pain in the region, and I&#39;ve taken Ibuprofin to deal with that pain.    I don&#39;t know how long this will last, but according to the handout I got, swollen lymph nodes are normal and I had no other adverse side effects other than feeling a bit drowsy this morning, though me staying up until 3:00 AM playing video games could be a confounding effect.

In my case, I was smelling &#34;cigarette smoke&#34; and &#34;wood smoke&#34; smells even though there were no cigarettes or wood burning in my vicinity. I had no health complications as a result, it was only slightly unpleasant at times. I did not seek treatment for this because it was a minor inconvenience and the issue went away after my first dose in a week. It hasn&#39;t been a week since my second dose but I assume it will go away similarly.

                                                started with soreness/stiffness in injection site, which I expected as it was how I reacted with the first shot.  however, I then started experiencing mild dizziness/visual impairment (feeling like my vision was shifting or &#34;glitching&#34;) that started around two hours after the shot, slow onset of sore/achy back muscles that hit peak pain at around 3am, and intense chills/shivers that started around 11pm, getting progressively worse as the night went on. Attempted to stop the chills by wrapping in several blankets, but only continued to feel colder and colder. Despite the chills starting around 11pm, fever did not present itself until around 1am, hitting 99.8°F by 1:30am. It was around this time that I took an ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which did not kick in until around 2:30am. Once the chills stopped, my hands and feet only got hotter, keeping me awake for an additional 2 1/2 hours.

                                                21yoM states that on 25 March 2021, he noted 25 minutes after his 1st dose of Pfizer vaccines, he noted a throat tightness, feels tight, scratchy, noted a hoarse throat with some voice changes. He felt throat tightness made it hard to breath, he had associated lightheadedness, felt anxious, almost like a wheezing sound when breathed in and out in his upper neck. When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy. Since then, when he drinks apple juice, his throat will start hurting, but otherwise, he has avoided raw and cooked allergies. He does report seasonal rhinitis symptoms that are worse in the fall. He takes allegra as needed to treat these symptoms. He is not carrying an Epipen currently

                                                Sometime after getting the Pfizer vaccine I noticed that my private area, underarms, and some other things now smell of onion. At first I had thought that it was the drink (Clear American Sparkling Water: Peach Flavor) that was changing my scent because it smelled and tasted heavily of onion. However, my thinking changed when the other flavors of this brand smelled and tasted as they should. My family and friends are not aware of the scent and cannot smell nor taste it. I have also noticed the scent outside my apartment complex on campus. There are no wild onions growing outside, but I can smell the scent when I walk near certain flowers or bushes before it fades away. Upon returning home the scent is still there. Showering controls the scent, but it gets worse throughout the day and makes me very subconscious about how I smell. I do not consume onion on a weekly basis, so the vaccine is the only oddball in my daily diet, so I believe that it is the culprit for this change. I believe that it may have potentially altered my sense of smell opposed to my thinking of my body odor itself changing. I have spoken to my Nurse Practitioner and we&#39;ve decided to play the waiting game, but she advised me to send in a notice of this to the CDC for additional help if possible.

                                                Overnight after shot just typical symptoms, some slight chills and next day just a little tired Day 2 after shot, April 11th.  Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

                                                A few days after receiving the first dose I started having allergic reactions to certain food that I usually eat normally. After certain foods/sauces touch my lips they begin to tighten up and puff up. I suspect it may be my immune system being more active then usual due to the anti-bodies being produced. I&#39;ve never had a lip allergy before. This allergy reaction has been ongoing ever since the 1st dose. It is extremely frustrating to eat foods now.

                                                I have always had low grade tinnitus and migraine related visual issues, so this could be a completely a coincidence. However I feel the need to report it just in case. On the night of May 29, I had begun to hear a low noticeable hum in my right ear and a feeling of fullness. This humming disappeared and returned on Tuesday, June 1st 2021, and then continued on and became worse upon waking up on Wednesday June 2nd, 2021. I am scheduling follow ups with an ENT specialist in order to understand the root cause.

                                                Within minutes of receiving  covid-19  vaccine, I became very  excessive sweaty (my shirt was wet), felt eyesight was dimming,  space perception was completely off, very pale,  dizziness  and unable to hear when being spoken too, felt faint. Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at the age of 22-year-old on 28May2021 17:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There was no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hadn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. About two days (30May2021 12:00) after the vaccine dose his bottom lip started to swell up very bad. The swelling went down after using ice and he was currently monitoring if any additional swelling occurs in his lips and throat area.  Treatment received for the event included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl). The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat started swelling, my tongue started swelling, and my tongue starting tingling. I&#39;ve had two allergic reactions before; this felt less severe, but otherwise similar. At 6:18 pm, I was given a shot of epinephrine, and started to feel better.   After that, I went to an urgent care center. They took my vitals, and everything looked alright. They told me to take Benadryl and monitor the situation, which I did. As I type (3:30 pm, 21 hours and 45 minutes later), I feel back to normal again: perfectly fine.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 27Mar2021 (between 11:55AM and 12:00PM) (Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via Intramuscular, at the age of 23-year-old, administered in right arm on 06Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6206, Expiry: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. He felt really terrible yesterday (07Apr2021). On Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well, and he could barely sleep last night (07Apr2021). His head felt heavy on Tuesday night (06Apr2021), and his head felt super heavy last night (07Apr2021). On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fatigue, on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow/throat pain, really bad headache, sensation of pressure in ear, sensation of pressure in eye, dizzy on standing, a little bit of nausea with the dizziness, really weak, he didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite, chills/teeth chattering, shaking, hot feeling generalized, sweating, feeling hot and cold. The patient experienced not feeling well on an unspecified date. Patient started developing symptoms that were very bad, he thought he had COVID. Patient had a PCR test that was negative. Patient would like to know if a delayed response after second dose is normal. Reported he had received his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose about 2 weeks ago (27Mar2021). He said he felt really terrible yesterday. He said he felt so bad that he thought he had the COVID-19 Virus, and went to get tested. He clarified he had a real time COVID-19 Virus PCR test yesterday (07Apr2021), and received a negative result today (08Apr2021), less than 24 hours after having the test performed. He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system. He said he had no symptoms after his second COVID-19 Vaccine, and was wondering if what he was experiencing now was a delayed immune response. Reported last night was the worst for his symptoms, saying it was awful. He said he felt better this morning. He clarified that on Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well. He said his head felt heavy, but when he woke up, he did not feel too bad. He said he had fatigue, and on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow. He said last night (07Apr2021), he had a really bad headache, and his head felt super heavy. He said he had ear and eye pressure. He said he got dizzy on standing, and at one point, had a little bit of nausea with the dizziness. He said he wasn&#39;t sure if the nausea was caused by the dizziness. He said he was really weak, and didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite. He said he took his temperature at around 8:00PM-9:00PM last night, and had no fever. He said he still had his sense of taste and smell. He said he had chills, he was shaking, and his teeth were chattering. He said he was also hot and sweating at times, like he was alternating between hot and cold. He said he tried to drink water yesterday, and would take a few sips of water when he turned over in bed. He said he could barely sleep. Treatment: Reported he took Ibuprofen 200mg tablets, off and on, to treat his headache because his headache was preventing him from sleeping. He said he would take 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets at a time. He said he took his first Ibuprofen dose in the middle of the night on Tuesday, and then took 2 more doses of 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets last night. He said he did not have the Ibuprofen 200mg tablet NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date because he had taken Ibuprofen from a different Ibuprofen 200mg bottle and put it in the Ibuprofen 200mg he was taking from. Reported he felt he had gained strength back today (08Apr2021) because he had showered this morning, and didn&#39;t fall over. He said he was so weak yesterday, even trying to text for his work was bad. He said his headache was a little worse today, and his left-sided throat pain was persisting, but everything else had subsided for now. Caller said he was wondering if what he had experienced was a delayed immune response, or a false negative COVID-19 Virus test, or something else, like Mono. Patient was not feeling well. Did test negative covid. The outcome of the event headache, Swallowing painful and Throat pain was not recovered, other events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 23-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included being a smoker (he vapes). The patient&#39;s sister has Addison&#39;s disease. There were no concomitant medications; no additional vaccines administered on the same date as BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EB8733) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 22Apr2021 at 14:00. He woke up on 23Apr2021 and felt like he had sinus pressure, then he blew his nose and had a bit of a nosebleed. He also felt like he could taste blood in his throat and mouth. The nosebleed stopped, but there was still some pressure in his sinuses. He asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He has a headache and it seemed like a sinus headache. It was more on the right side where he had the nosebleed. He could still kind of taste a little bit of blood in his mouth and throat. There were no relevant tests, but he was trying to figure out if it&#39;s needed. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. He was not hospitalized but he was trying to decide if he needed to go to the hospital. The outcome of the event nose bleed was recovered on 23Apr2021 and not recovered for all other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.  Follow-up (23Apr2021): New information from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: patient details, medical history, historical vaccine, therapy details, reaction data (&#34;Can taste blood in his throat and mouth&#34; and &#34;has a headache and it seems like a sinus headache&#34; were added; outcome and onset were updated), and course of events.

                                                I am healthy 23 year old male. I have never suffered from any sort of illness or conditions. After massive push by the goverment and incentivization to take the New Covid-19 Vaccines deemed safe , I went ahead and received the Pfizer shot on 05/24/2021. A day after I felt headache and dizziness. This stopped on the third day. Later I would have episodes of blurred vision. That stopped. But what has really affected me and continues to affect me , is that a week after I have developed major difficulty breathing.  I never , ever not even once in my life have suffered from breathing problems. It all started on an afternoon a week after the shot randomly with really fast heart palpitations and after those palpitations stopped I was choking, I could not breathe at all. After this , I am having trouble breathing normally or getting enough air in along with tightness in the chest area. For instance, I struggle with two breaths and then the third I will likely get more air in. I have felt incredible tightness in my chest. There has been nights where I cannot sleep because I am unable to breathe , and feel like I am choking. So , I need to get up and walk around the house to catch my breath.  I am having shortness of breath  and my breathing is not like it used to be. I do not have any fever or any other symptoms , the persisting problem is the tightness and difficulty breathing. I already went to the Pulmonary doctor a couple days ago and underwent testing that are pending.  I do not understand why this happened to me , I am not sure if it is a coincidence or if there is a relation between  me having taken that Pfizer shot . But prior to taking that vaccine I never  once had trouble with  my breathing  and never felt tightness around my chest. This is new to me and it scares me to think this might stay with me forever, whatever it is. I pray it goes away. I am still having trouble . and the fact that in the past I never thought about my breathing because it was normal, and now it is a constant issue throughout  the day,  moments when I can get air and others when it is very difficult. I  am reporting this  to leave a record of this incident because prior to me taking this vaccine , I was in fact a fully healthy person free of any sort of health issues.

                                                I usually get very light headed from needles so I brought a coke and luckily didn?t pass out in the process. However, the following night I had severe stomach pains and felt like I could throw up all night. I also was freezing but had so many blankets and sweatshirts on I was sweating too. But what?s really concerning me is that I usually wear glasses to help me see and they worked up until yesterday. I cant see things close up anymore and my glasses only work for further away things.

Simultaneously this is mixed with fatigue regardless of how much sleep I get or water that I drink. Less frequently I have symptoms like eyes burning (similar to bad allergies), slight dizziness, minor headaches, and minor body aches. The fatigue and brain fog are by far the worst and still persist, the others listed are minor but still come and go in small amounts. On Wednesday (4/14) I took Zyrtec (10mg tablet) to help focus throughout the day then one ibuprofen tablet (200mg) at night, and on Friday (4/16) I only took the Zyrtec. Since then I have not taken any medications. The symptoms were alleviated by the medication but without them all symptoms come and go to varying degrees throughout the day and worsen by night time.

Patient received first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and sat in chairs to be observed. About 15 minutes later I walked out to check on the patient and he was staring straightforward, sweating, and pale. When asked if he was okay he stated his vision was looking blurry and felt dizzy. Took patient&#39;s blood pressure, elevated his legs as I couldn&#39;t move him safely at the time, gave him water to drink, applied cool compresses to neck and forehead. Patient was observed by a clinic staff member during entire event. Rechecked patient&#39;s blood pressure 5 minutes later at resolution of symptoms. Patient then left with adult visitor that came with him.

                                                About three minutes after the shot was injected, I started getting cold sweats.  About two minutes after that I started to hear a ringing in my ears.  This ringing got louder over the course of a minute and eventually my hearing was completely gone and I could only hear the ringing loudly.  As the ringing was at it&#39;s loudest, My peripheral vision started to go black and I nearly feinted.  Over about two minutes, I slowly had my normal hearing and vision return and the ringing in my ears got quiet.

                                                The patient had mild lip swelling, and tongue felt funny 15 to 20 minutes after their 1st dose. The patient was asked to sit for a few minutes longer to monitor but said they were okay and went home. It was recommended to have Benadryl on hand in case they needed it, and if any of his symptoms worsened at all to go to the hospital.  I called and followed up with patient 1 &amp; 1/2 hour after his shot and he was feeling much better and had taken a dose of Benadryl. He was again advised to monitor for any more signs or symptoms of lip/tongue/throat swelling and to seek medical attention if was having any of these symptoms. He also was advised to follow up with his PCP to see if he should get his 2nd dose or hold off due to the reaction he experienced.

                                                Felt sick/slightly feverish 12 hours after shot, hard to sleep. Day after shot was mostly normal, though a little under the weather.  After another day, all cold symptoms were gone.   Tinnitus in the right ear started 3 days after 2nd Pfizer COVID shot. Initially was only audible at night, when sleeping in a quiet room, but after 2 days became audible during day.  Tinnitus presented as a high pitched steady ringing in the ear. Triggered intense anxiety and perception of the tinnitus increased to almost debilitating levels. Mental health counseling and prescription of daily amitriptyline to help with sleep and lorazepam to take as needed for anxiety has helped cope with tinnitus and associated mental aspects. Ringing still persists after almost four weeks after it started, but is perceived to be less loud now.

I just want to be healthy again please just help me figure out what the cause is I hope it has no relation to the vaccine I think its just chance I keep getting sick. But I don&#39;t get sick so it makes no sense! I&#39;ve been sporadically out of work since vaccine for I believe over 5 weeks and it is incredibly disheartening

                                                Chest pain issues have resolved mostly. The most debilitating thing to come after the vaccine was the onset of ringing, buzzing persistently in left ear, comes and goes in right ear. Started 2 weeks and 2 days after second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and after flying multiple times and started when I got back on the 13th of April 2021. It has remained constant but has improved slightly from where it was in the beginning, have been doing Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (five 1 hour sessions, spaced about a week-week and a half apart over the last 2 months to see if things improve). Things I would say have improved but I am running out of patience and financial means to keep going to a doctor. I feel helpless, depressional, work performance is awful, and lastly very suicidal than I have ever been. Just want to die.

                                                About a week or two after my second shot, I started developing constant, uncontrollable blinking. It feels like a spasm and causes other parts of my face to spasm (my jaw especially). I think it was exacerbated by my use of Zyn nicotine pouches, because the issue got better once I discontinued use. A couple weeks have passed since I stopped using this product though and the blinking/spasms persist.

                                                the bottom of the eyelid being swollen; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer (parent- mother) reported for a patient (son). A 24-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0185, Expiration date: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18May2021, around 19:00 (at the age of 24-year-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient Patient&#39;s Medical History(including any illness at time of vaccination was none. The patient was healthy. The concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) If applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s) was provided as no. The Reporter reported that her son received the first injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 18May2021, and later that day started experiencing the bottom of the eyelid being swollen. Maybe three or three and a half hours after receiving the first dose Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine, the bottom eyelid swelled up: The Reporter states it is her son&#39;s bottom right eyelid, it was a little swollen, a little red in the corner and now it looks like her son got punched in the eye. The Reporter states her son&#39;s eyelid is not bruised, but it is swollen. Reports it has worsened since Tuesday night, 18MAY2021. The Reporter stated her son&#39;s eyelid was now more swollen and almost like where you get dark circles under your eyes. It looked similar to what it would look like if someone punched him in the eye. The Reporter was not sure if this was a reaction to the first dose Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. The Reporter showed photos to an allergist, the allergist does not think it was from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine but is not sure. The allergist told the Reporter to apply cold compresses on her son&#39;s eyelid and go from there. She was asking whether her son should receive the second Pfizer COVID-19 injection or not since he had this reaction after the first. Reporter seriousness for the event was unspecified. Adverse event did not required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Relevant tests performed was reported as none. The outcome of event was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.  Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                I administered the vaccine to Jake and he sat down. About two minutes later, he slumped in his chair. My manager rushed to catch him from falling and I assisted in steadying him. He was breathing erratically, excessively diaphoretic, and his muscles were twitching frequently. His eyes were dilated and he became unresponsive. Fearing a seizure, we lowered him to the floor and turned him on his side. He became responsive and coherent again approximately one minute later and was speaking to us normally. Paramedics arrived several minutes later and took over care. He was taken to the hospital due to abnormal vital signs.

Symptoms included headache, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, feeling feverish, and itching on torso, arms, and legs . Symptoms seemed to improve over the next week or two before worsening again on 3/27/21 around 10:00 am. On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

WE GOT HIM ON HIS BACK, AND KNEES BENT, WHILE WE WAITED FOR EMS. I TOOK HIS PULSE WHILE WAITING FOR EMS AND DID NOT NOTE ANY BRADYCARDIA OR TACHYCARDIA. EMS TOOK OVER CARE AND FINISHED EXAMINATION IN THE TRUCK. HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS WITH HIM AND SAID SHE WOULD DRIVE HIM HOME.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No. EWO187) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19May2021 at 12:00 or 13:00. Relevant history included Diabetes, obesity, endocrine abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, respiratory illness, compromised immune status and Allergies. The patient had Allergies to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can induce anaphylactic shock, severe reaction, swelling of face and throat. Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines were Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable. No Vaccines were Administered prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History was none. About 3-5 minutes after being administered the Vaccine, the patient immediately developed anaphylactic shock. He was transported via ambulance to the Emergency Room on 19May2021 where he verified he was admitted to the hospital Emergency room for about 5-6 hours and discharged from the hospital the same day, 19May2021. He was told not to get any additional doses.  He was still having swelling of the throat and went back to the ER today and was given a steroid prednisone 40mg a day for 5 days.  He was advised to take benadryl also.  He said he didn&#39;t get any IVs or anything.  He had a past medical history of anaphylactic reaction to NSAIDS.  He has been advised not to get the second dose. The patient stated the anaphylactic shock occurred with trouble breathing, throat was swelling and itchy throat. He did go into ER, they told him to just keep drinking fluids, that there was nothing else they could really do. When he was seen in the emergency room they gave him Benadryl and a steroid: Prednisone for now which he is on for the next couple of days. He was told that after 2 days or something, that after getting injected that he wouldn&#39;t have any symptoms-but he is still having those pretty severe symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Initial onset of anaphylactic shock was about 3-5 minutes after Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot was administered. Within 10-15 minutes he had swelling of tongue and throat and difficulty breathing. They called an ambulance, the ambulance took him to the Hospital emergency room where he was admitted and discharged that same date on 19May2021 after about 5-6 hours; he reported discharge time was around 16:40. They told him to come back if he had any issues that occurred over next couple of days or worsening or causing problems; to call back the nurses line. He was on a lot of Benadryl, a lot of antihistamines. When he gets off the antihistamines almost all the allergic reactions of the anaphylactic shock reoccur. This morning, 21May2021, he didn&#39;t take any Bendaryl before bed, and this morning when he woke up he was alright. After being at work like 30 minutes he felt the itchiness; scratchy throat; swelling of tongue; a little swelling of the throat; difficulty breathing. He took Benadryl and called the hotline who told him to call the Emergency room, he called the emergency room and went there. He talked to them this morning because he went to work and had issues breathing. He called and they told him to come in asap, so he went in to the emergency room; they gave him Benadryl and told him there was nothing else they could do other than him taking the steroid: Prednisone. The patient was in the hospital 3 days and will be day 4 tomorrow. He was trying to figure out how long this will last. They told him to talk to his doctor. They basically told him they were not responsible. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her son received the shot Wed 19May2021. Does not know if the Walgreen&#39;s reported this. He left there in an ambulance within 10 minutes of getting the shot. They took him to the emergency room and he got mixed information. He went back again today. They blew him off and told him maybe it was something he ate. She assumed that an allergic reaction would be about 24 hours but this is day 3. She is scared he may be taking too much Benadryl. He said he felt like he needed something to drink. Said that his throat felt really thirsty. He went back inside since his throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up. They saw that his throat was swollen and they called the paramedics. Within 15 minutes they came and brought him to the emergency room.  Nobody had given him Epi. They were going to give it to him an Epi pen  but he wanted to wait for the paramedics. He was freaking out. The paramedics showed up and they were unable to give him Epi, stating he didn&#39;t have hives. He only received Benadryl. They he had to have to give him extra Benadryl because whatever they gave him in the IV because the first didn&#39;t work and his throat was still closing up. It made him feel like a drug addict asking for Benadryl.  She was not sure if they gave him Benadryl in the ambulance, knows that it was given in the emergency room. The Benadryl may have been started in the ambulance but she is not sure. They did give him oxygen in the ambulance. Clarified he was in the ER over 4 hours, but was not admitted to the hospital. They gave him steroids but forgot to send him home with steroids. He had to call to find out about getting them and they told him they forgot to send the prescription in. He was late starting the next dose of steroids. He went back to the ER today, day 3. He didn&#39;t feel too bad today and went to work. After exerting a little energy and moving around, his throat started to do it again. He didn&#39;t have Benadryl on him. He left work because he thought it was going to close up again the day he got the shot. Once he calmed down, he took Benadryl. He called the hospital to ask if this was  normal. He was told that it is not normal and was told that if he still felt bad, to come to the hospital. They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses. He spoke to one of the doctors. They had never shown him how to use an ePi pen. He does not know how long this will last. He gets scared. Treatment: Has only been taking Benadryl. He started the steroids yesterday and today. They had given him Benadryl today in the ER and he is home now. The patient visited to the Emergency room twice, first time by ambulance, confirmed he was not admitted. He was pretty devastated. The outcome of events was unknown.

After about a week, COVID fog/fatigue symptoms began.  It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.

                                                Over a month after receiving my second dose of Pfizer, I had an episode of lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, and fatigue. I attributed it to dehydration and laid down and ate a snack, I began to feel better after 1-2 hours. A week later I had another lightheadedness incident that sent me back to bed (this one being slightly worse). I experience slight chest pain in my upper right chest muscle. It took me a day to recover from this spell. I constantly felt weak and as if I was about to faint. I went to the doctor two days later and got blood work done and measured my blood pressure. Everything came back normal. On Saturday June 19th, I had another near-fainting experience in a public setting. My hearing changed, I couldn&#39;t think straight, I was very shaky and weak, and I tried to drink a lot of water. Nothing helped so I went home and once I got in bed I was aggressively shaking. Since then I have been bed-ridden for the week, and unable to do normal activities such as go for walks, exercise, or go to work. I am going to visit a cardiologist tomorrow.
