Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation.

Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation.

                                                Patient was nervous about getting vaccine. Discussed safety profile of vaccine and that many people are tolerating very well. Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

I hear peoples voices in that buzz noise under their normal voice, almost like robotic. I don&#39;t know if this is related to the vaccine or not but I did notice it start the day after I got vaccinated.

A 23-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included being a smoker (he vapes). The patient&#39;s sister has Addison&#39;s disease. There were no concomitant medications; no additional vaccines administered on the same date as BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EB8733) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 22Apr2021 at 14:00. He woke up on 23Apr2021 and felt like he had sinus pressure, then he blew his nose and had a bit of a nosebleed. He also felt like he could taste blood in his throat and mouth. The nosebleed stopped, but there was still some pressure in his sinuses. He asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He has a headache and it seemed like a sinus headache. It was more on the right side where he had the nosebleed. He could still kind of taste a little bit of blood in his mouth and throat. There were no relevant tests, but he was trying to figure out if it&#39;s needed. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. He was not hospitalized but he was trying to decide if he needed to go to the hospital. The outcome of the event nose bleed was recovered on 23Apr2021 and not recovered for all other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.  Follow-up (23Apr2021): New information from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: patient details, medical history, historical vaccine, therapy details, reaction data (&#34;Can taste blood in his throat and mouth&#34; and &#34;has a headache and it seems like a sinus headache&#34; were added; outcome and onset were updated), and course of events.

It felt like I burned my tongue on a hot coffee but I hadn?t don?t that recently. My tongue was also slightly swollen. The following day (2 days after the vaccine) I woke up with that same symptom but the effect/discomfort was worse. Third day post vaccine it got worse again. Then starting on the 4th day post vaccine, it started to get better and return to normal a little bit each day. I?m 5 days post vaccine and still have this burned feeling lingering on my tongue.
