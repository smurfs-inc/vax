                                                Patient woke up at 5 am the morning after receiving the shot and was talking about things that weren?t there. He was asking for ammo and saying everything was moving so fast and that we were all in a line and no one would give him ice water. His heart was beating really fast. His temperature was 98.4. He was shivering and sweating. This lasted about 2 hours and then he fell asleep. Today he remembers everything that he said and that happened.

                                                Received 2nd dose of vaccine on 6/19/2021, left ear started feel muffling when hearing sound the next morning . Symptom got worse on  the third day. Went to see pediatrician on that same day. Checked hearing, which was fine. Doctor couldn&#39;t find out why. Was told to wash nose for a couple of days and went back to the office if symptom did not get better in one week. Washed nose once with Sinus Rinse. Symptom got better on day five and completely recovered on day six.  Also, on day five (6/23/2021), found a dime sized ulcers on the left side scalp of his head about one and half inches above his left ear. The ulcers seemed healing today, so he will not go to see doctor for that. He did not do anything different and never had that issue before.  These were not listed as potential side effects and scared me.  Think he will be fine. Wish some one could alert me ahead of time.

                                                Had the vaccine on Saturday and on Tuesday afternoon, felt very dizzy, became very pale, had chest pain,  pressure in  chest and couldn&#39;t take a deep breath,  vision kept moving in and out, had to sit down, felt very hot and cold at the same time and was actually sweating and feeling chills. Took it easy for the next 4-5 days and just stayed home and in bed. When it got really bad, took a dose of ibuprofen.  The symptoms slowly got better and disappeared. Took about three doses of ibuprofen total over a few days. Talked to our pediatrician a week later who said we should report this.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

                                                His mother was present and told us he had multiple allergies to foods and sulfites, as well as asthma. He used to carry an epi pen but does not currently, also has a history of asthma for which he carries a rescue inhaler. He received the Pfizer vaccine at approximately 9:15am in his left deltoid, and about 2 minutes later Mom notified me and the school nurse that he was starting to get &#34;hives&#34;. I noted a localized, small area of erythema on his left upper arm around the bandaid, approximately silver dollar sized, not raised. School RN removed the bandaid. He did not complain of itching and at that time stated he felt like he was breathing fine. The school RN gave him 50mg of Benadryl PO per the mom&#39;s request at 0920. The patient was in no distress, breathing and speaking normally. At 0922 he stated he felt like his throat and tongue were swelling, so I had him remove his mask, and asked mom if his lips looked swollen to which she responded &#34;yes&#34;. He stated it felt like it was hard to swallow. We placed a pulse ox on the patient and his oxygen saturations were 96-100%, HR 85-90, RR 30. We administered an adult epi pen (0.3mg of epinephrine) into his left lateral thigh at 0923 and had the school office call EMS. The patient remained in no acute distress, and said the swelling in his tongue felt better after the epi, but that his throat still felt swollen. Lungs clear bilaterally, RR remained 24-30, HR 110-115, pulse ox 98-100%, erythema on left upper arm resolved. Fire department arrived at 0935- report given and they checked a pulse ox as well. Patient walked to parking lot to ambulance for transfer to Hospital with mother following behind.

                                                Was fine the night before. Woke up and his eyelids were swollen and his lips were swollen. Immediately, my wife called Telehealth and described the situation. They said to get him some Benadryl and we gave him that. He also had a headache - we might have give him a Tylenol. With Benadryl - he took four or five doses according to the protocol on the Benadryl. He did not go to school. The next day, he was swollen but not as bad. My wife bought him Claritin and he didn&#39;t do anything because he didn&#39;t know which to take (Benadryl or Claritin). His swelling went away quite a bit that day without taking anything and he went back on Wednesday -there was still a little bit of swelling but not much. He wasn&#39;t feeling great though that whole week. He was still tired and was a bit headachy until Friday or so. Somewhere on the weekend he felt back to himself.  He is due for second vaccine this weekend and we aren&#39;t going to have him take it then. We&#39;re concerned and have decided to hold - the physician said he shouldn&#39;t have had a COVID vaccine two weeks before this Pfizer one (he received the Varicella) on the 29th of April- -Dr said  it should have been a month  or so of waiting  still before  he had this vaccine after that.

He stumbled forward then fell down. Patient did hit his head. Store associate got him up and into a chair and started asking him questions. Mom stated he had just received vaccine. They were not told by the pharmacist on duty to stay to be monitored for 15 minutes after.  He did say that he had a headache. Gave the patient some water, had him move his arm around, and monitored patient until pharmacy closed.

                                                Small rash developed near his lip; excessive tiredness; he wasnt able to eat.; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (parent, caregiver).  A 13-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s son) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in May2021 about one week ago at 13 years old at 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was a special needs child who was non verbal autistic. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced small rash developed near his lip last Thursday (20May2021) and by the weekend (May2021) he was not able to eat. His mom took him to see hcp and antibiotic cefalexin (CEPHALEXIN) was prescribed which was helping. The patient was having excessive tiredness on May2021 but was unsure if related to covid vaccine. Was it common to have excessive tiredness one week after the covid vaccine? Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of small rash developed near his lip, and he was not able to eat. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

We got him a cold pack, water, fruit snacks, a mat to lay on and a fan and the patient walked out okay. His reaction was directly after the shot and lasted about 5-10 seconds. Patient walked out of the facility fine and had his mother with him.

                                                Patient was examined by his pediatrician and cleared for physical exercise on 06/01/2021; 4 days before receiving his 1st COVID19 shot on 06/05/2021. On 06/07/2021 we dropped patient off at Soccer Camp. At 10am he started basic soccer ball control drills, which did not include rigorous exercise. At 10:30am we received a call from him, asking for us to pick him up as he had almost blacked out a few times.  We arrived at the sports field at 10:40am. I found patient to be red faced, sweaty, but cohesive. He described the following symptoms occurred during mild exercise: difficulty breathing, thirsty, fast heartbeat, &#34;black things&#34; over eyes, preventing clear vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty hearing, feeling faint  He took a water break and used his pro-air inhaler, as he thought he might have been having his 1st asthma attack (he&#39;s only ever presented with slight wheezing or night time cough). After a short break, his symptoms subsided, so he re-joined the group. After one more soccer drill, the symptoms came back again, but this time he experienced very hard palpitations and the feeling that his shoes were squeezing his feet. At that point he asked for permission to call to us and have us collect him.  We took him home and monitored him for a while. He seemed calm and symptom free. I had him shower and he was fine for the rest of the day.  The following day I had him jog on our treadmill for a period. He was symptom free. I increased inclination on the treadmill and he handled it ok without any of the previous symptoms. However, now realizing that he was within the 3 day window of his COVID shot, I decided not take him back to the soccer camp.   As of 06/13/2021 he has not complained of any symptoms returning. That said, he also has not performed any significant outdoor exercise since then either, besides walking.

A few hours later after completing his morning therapies he showered and went to take a nap. At this time he was febrile to 103.6.  At 1600 he had seizure-like activity with trunk and upper extremity shaking as well as eyes rolling back and drooling.  Parents put him in car and transported him to an outside hospital. He did stop seizing prior to getting to that hospital.  Parents reported seizure lasted approximately 15 minutes with no loss of bowel or bladder control.  By time he arrived at local emergency room he was back at his neurological baseline. At the outside hospital our PICU was consulted and he was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin in meningitic dosing.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

The Rph administering the vaccine moved in front of the patient and gently moved his head into an upright position. The patient had mild muscle spasms and twitches while passed out but when he regained consciousness he immediately began talking saying he was ok. Father came into the consultation room at that point and Rph explained what had occurred. Patient looked a little pale and eyes were having a hard time staying open so with the help of his dad Rph helped him down to the ground in the corner of the room so he could have back and head support from the wall. Patient was given a glucose tablet and water, and later orange juice. Patient stayed in the consultation room for about 20 minutes before leaving on his own and saying he was feeling much almost back to normal.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

                                                Woke up with blurred vision in left eye on Saturday, May 30.  Went to see eye doctor after Memorial Day Weekend.  20/50 in left eye (was 20/20).  So far diagnosed with inflammation of optic nerve.  Going to a retinal specialist June 2.  Talk of seeing a neurologist as well to figure out why there&#39;s inflammation - he&#39;s too young.  Dr is wondering if it is due to COVID shot 3 weeks ago.

He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

After getting the patient to relax, the vaccine was able to be administered. However, patient then became pale, lethargic, and had ringing ears. The patient was sat down and given water while being observed. The pharmacist tried to check his heart rate but without success. EMS was then called for more advanced observation. Patient was recuperating while the EMS was on their way. EMS determined patient might have had an anxiety attack and cleared him after finishing their observations.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after the administration of the shot, my son began shaking uncontrollably. He also described visual and tactile disturbances - a sort of hyper awareness as if a precursor to hallucinations - and a racing mind. The shaking and visual and tactile sensations resolved after roughly two hours. He then developed a fever of 100.8, that lasted another 4-5 hours. His symptoms resolved completely within about 14 hours of onset.

EMS arrived and monitored him. father and EMS made decision to return pt to home.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

                                                Seconds after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, patient complained of headache and stomachache and lightheadedness. Patient&#39;s eyes rolled and he became limp. Patient&#39;s mother and the pharmacist helped him to the floor, and he regained consciousness seconds later. He was given water and a granola bar and said he felt better after a few minutes. This adverse effect did not occur with the first dose.
