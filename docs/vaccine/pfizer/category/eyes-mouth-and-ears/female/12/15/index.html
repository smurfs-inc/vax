                                                Swelling of the upper left lip on 05/20/2021 noticed when she woke up at 7am. No signs or history of trauma. Gave Benadryl 25mg liquid orally and iced the area. A second dose of Benadryl was given at 1pm as the swelling had not subsided. By evening her lip was normal.  When waking up on 05/21/2021 she noticed a approx 1cm ulcerative type lesion on her inner upper lip. The lip was swollen again, but slightly less so. Repeated Benadryl 25mg  three times that day at 6 hour intervals. Started on triamcinolone 0.1% cream prescribed by her pediatrician that evening.  On 05/22/2021 the lip was not swollen and the ulcer appears to be healing on the upper lip, but a small portion of her lower left lip now shows an approx 1-2mm ulcerative lesion. Triamcinolone 0.1%cream applied 3x daily.  She noticed a irregular confluent red rash approx 4cmx2cm on her right mid abdomen on Tuesday after swimming, but unsure if this is related.

The twitching of the head happens as often as every hour or more. The twitching of the right eye is rare. Depending on how fast the twitch happens with her head pain is associated with it.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

                                                Patient was very nervous about the receiving the 2nd dose. We had a in depth conversation about side effects because she had a headache with the 1st dose. Mom held her hand. A few minutes post, her sister saw that she was slumped over &amp; her eyes had rolled to the back of her head. We tried to wake her up &amp; she was very lethargic. I gave her 2 small bottles of water, pb crackers, 3 hard candies &amp; elevated her feet. Mom said we didn&#39;t need to get medical attention. After about 10 minutes she was still very lethargic &amp; mom said yes to EMS when asked again. Another mom came over &amp; helped us lay her on the floor to elevate her feet above her head. Her husband came in &amp; assessed patient. Her pulse was 60 &amp; when he asked her to squeeze his fingers &amp; press against his feet it was week. She told us that she hadn&#39;t eaten a full meal since the night before, only had watermelon as a snack. The ambulance came &amp; took her.

                                                This was my daughter&#39;s 2nd dose of the vaccine.  After she got up on the morning of the 12th, I heard her in the shower and went to check on her.  Her face looked gray and she said that she needed to sit down.  After sitting for a bit, she was able to stand up, but then proceeded to fall forward, as if she were passing out.  I was able to steady her and sat her back down.  Her eyes looked like they were staring off into space.  She said that she couldn&#39;t see me and everything was &#34;purple and yellow.&#34;  This lasted a few minutes and then I was able to get her out of the shower and dressed.  She then began to regain some normalcy and was fine after that.  She ate breakfast and rested.  She didn&#39;t have any more episodes after that, but I could tell that she wasn&#39;t as perky that day.  This episode was definitely not normal for my daughter, so I felt that I should report it.

Her mother and I both tried to lean here back in the chair she was sitting in.  she jolted a few times and her eyes rolled backwards. I asked her mother if she has ever had seizures, she responded no.  Her mother stabilized her and I ran to get the NP next door, by the time we returned she had regained consciousness, but was a little confused and very pale.  The NP checked her out and found out she did not eat breakfast.  We gave her some apple juice.  After 15-20 minutes her color had come back, she felt fine, and she was able to leave.  Her mother told me later that both patient and her mother have had syncope events in the past.

Her mom then put her arm around the patient who then fainted.  The mom held her up and gently laid her on the floor and raised her legs up on the chair.  I got the patient a bottle of water and the color came back into her face.  She laid on the floor for about 15 minutes and then waited another 15 minutes after that and was feeling fine after that and she went home with her mom.

                                                My daughter experienced on day of her 2nd vaccine, feel nauseated in the evening time, then the second day. Felt very lethargic, fatigue, laying in bed all day, sleeping. She still had nausea also experienced chills, highest temp 99.8F. Her arm pit on the right side where she got the vaccine was really sore. She basically like within a couple of days she started her period cycle again and it was very heavy and lasted one week and half almost two weeks. On 06-08-2021, at about 10pm, she was brushing her teeth when she saw black spots and she went to tell me. At about 11:30pm that night, she squatted to pat our dog and when she got up and she felt really dizzy, lightheaded so I got concerned. Her symptoms persisted and I scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician on 06-15-2021. The pediatrician ruled out anemia. Her pediatrician said she has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Her pediatrician said that this is something manageable, she needs to strengthen her calf muscles and drink lots of water. They monitored her heart pressure and blood pressure.  Her heart rate had increased to 40bpm.  I also gave her Ibuprofen medication after the vaccine. Leading to today she has been having dizziness and light headiness every single day. My daughter is still  experiencing  symptoms, dizzy and light headed today.   For her 1st vaccine- within few days after her 1st dose, she experienced when using the treadmill, she would feel very dizzy. I did not think anything of it at first and this happened three times then it stopped. She also had a sore arm.

States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient&#39;s mother thought patient looked &#34;blue.&#34; A Health Department nurse administered one EpiPen while another staff member called 911. Patient stopped drooling, regained normal color in her face, and began smiling almost immediately  after epinephrine was administered. Nurse then took and recorded patient&#39;s blood pressure as 92/62, pulse as 64bpm, and respiratory rate as 24. Paramedics arrived approximately five minutes later and evaluated patient, who seemed to have returned to normal. Patient and her mother declined to have the patient transported to the hospital via ambulance for further observation. Patient was then driven home by her mother. Deputy COVID Operations Chief spoke with patient&#39;s mother over the phone around 6:30PM that same day to follow up with the patient. Patient&#39;s mother reported that the patient had returned to her normal self, had not experienced any further adverse events, and wished to move on from the incident.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

As soon as the needle was withdrawn her eyes rolled over and she slumped in her chair. We ( myself, her mother and her father) where in the process of placing her on the floor when she indicated that she wanted to get up. We placed her back into her seat and her mother proceeded to rub her back. I asked her if she needed anything but she declined. I kept her for observation for 30 minutes monitoring for any signs of shortness of breath, wheezing or swelling of the tongue or throat. No symptoms were observed. I advised her mother to notify patient&#39;s pediatrician of the incident and then released the patient.

                                                My daughter began having a headache a few hours after being vaccinated - that was on Sunday 6/6/21 and we didn&#39;t think much of it. The headache (and fatigue) continued Monday and Tuesday as well. But by that Tuesday afternoon 6/8, she was complaining that her vision was impaired.  She couldn&#39;t see things out of the right corner of her right eye. Example, when she looked at my face she could only see the left half, not the right half. When she looked down at her phone, some numbers on the right side of the screen seemed to be missing from her field of view. Additionally, she said she was having a hard time spelling easy words (ex. &#34;because&#34;) and was processing information really slowly when reading -- she noticed she was going much slower than normal.

Around 5pm she told me that she was hurting a lot and she needed help. I examined her and it looked like a bruise about the size of a dime but long. I asked if she fell or hurt herself, no. I called the pediatrician and informed them and they suggested seeing them the following day. Took her to the ER later that night due to significant pain. They thought she might have yeast infection or herpes. Gave her some antibiotics and sent her home her pain level was a 7 and she now looked like she chemical burn. The next day I took her to pediatrician. She felt like it could be herpes or something else. Prescribed different meds and sent us home. Nothing for pain. The antibiotics worked a little, but by Monday everything was horrible.  She was covered in sores from the labia major to her vulva. Took her to ER where they felt like it was herpes. She was asked about her sexual experience or being molested. They immediately admitted her to the hospital where we stayed for 4 days. With antibiotics, steroids and pain meds. She saw her Gynecologist Tuesday morning where she determined PT was suffering from aphthous ulcers, a side effect that she was aware of from the covid19 vaccine.

At 4:30 Mom brought patient back to the pharmacy and said she was feeling strange. Patient said her throat felt weird, she felt dizzy and was having ear pressure, but was not having difficultly breathing.  I offered Benadryl and to call 911, Mom denied her needing that at the time.  While we were asking patient questions her eyes started to roll and flutter and her head would fall back, but she was alert and talking and stated that she was seeing spots. I told Mom that we were going to call 911 at that time so they could come and check her out. I also go an ice pack and we placed it on her neck, her face was flushed and I took her temperature it was 99.2 at 4:42pm. Ambulance arrived at 4:45pm and they did her vitals and she walked out to the ambulance with them to be checked out.  I called Mom at 6pm to check on patient and she was doing much better and did not have to go to ER.

                                                Pt came to my office today for evaluation of itching and swelling around mouth starting 1 hour after getting her first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine.  She did not have hives but rather papules.  In the office her rash had resolved with the exception of mild erythema. She also complained of an itchy throat but had onset of rhinorrhea and sneezing yesterday.  She took benadryl yesterday which made no difference.  She had no cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting or diarrhea.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

She answered no.  Right after a few minutes of reporting the symptoms, I asked patient&#39;s mom if  it&#39;s ok for me to call the paramedic.  Her symptoms went away before the paramedic came.  They checked on her pulse and said she&#39;s ok but still took her to monitor for further evaluation.

                                                I administered the vaccine, got one side of the band-aid on and that is when her head fell back.  Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

Ice, juice, water were given to the student.  Student vomited x 1,  Student rested on the cot until she felt better in about 10 minutes.

                                                Patient developed dizziness and coldness in extremities. She tried walking and fell down, but did not lose consciousness. She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

                                                Approximately five minutes after the vaccination, patient became very light-headed and nauseated with loss of vision. She was offered water and hard candy while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. She took a small amount of each, but declined anything else from the store. She seemed to be in significant distress and had difficulty moving to the immunization room where she would be out of view from others in the store. Parmedics arrived and checked her vitals and said those looked ok, so they didn&#39;t seem concerned. Patient still seemed very unsteady when leaving, but did say that her vision had improved. Patients were advised to keep a very close eye on her.

Patient did not fall or hit head, due to father being in the proximity and able to protect her from hitting the floor. Patient regained consciousness quickly within seconds and was moved to the floor while her feet were elevated. Patient stated that she saw a bit blurry and feeling shaky right before fainting. Patient was seen to be a bit pale in the lips but color came back after a few minutes. When patient&#39;s mother came, it was learned that the patient had a similar experience with an allergy shot in the past. Patient blood pressure was 110/71. Patient laid on the floor for a while before sitting back up.

                                                On the outset: There is no proven link of the vaccine with what happened, but I am filling this just in case you see a pattern emerge: She was vaccinated (pfizer, 1st dose) on Saturday, May 15 2021. A couple of hours later she started experiencing mild symptoms (moderate headache, which we thought as a normal reaction). These persisted on and off  until Wednesday, May 19th, when patient started having swollen and painful glands at the back of her mouth. Long story short, after testing first for strep, followed by blood work, patient&#39;s blood test came back positive with mono on Monday, May 24. The reason for this report is that I have read that mRNA vaccines, great as they may be, may trigger a virus response for viruses that stay within a person - like shingles or herpes etc. The way I understand it, mono also stays with a person. Patient had never been diagnosed with mono before, but mono sometimes does not have symptoms. So, is it possible that she had mono sometime before the vaccine, and it got re-triggered  due to the vaccine? Again, just in case you see a pattern, I am just reporting if helpful. Patient also developed  a mono rash on Wednesday, May 26; treated with topical benadryl cream.

She also stated she could not hear out of her right ear.  She wanted to stay seated with her eyes closed.  Everything resolved within 13 minutes with no treatment.

We gave her some glucose tablets and she seemed to get better afterwards.  I did a pulse oximeter on her her and her pulse and oxygen was normal.  I offered mother if she wanted me to call 911 and she said no.  I counseled mother and the girl to monitor how she is feeling and to seek 911 or urgent care if she gets worst throughout the day.  The girl left the store feeling okay.

                                                On sunday night, about 36 hours after vaccination, she started to have numbness of her lower jaw and tongue. She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

Another shopper who said she was an ER nurse told the pharmacy staff to have the patient lay down across the chairs then left. The patient was weak, cold, clammy, and pale. The patient then told the pharmacist that she had left her mother at the check out section, went upstairs, used the bathroom, was coming down the stairs when her vision started to have black spots. She reached her mother when she said she didn&#39;t feel good and started to pass out. The mother stated she caught her daughter. At this point, the RPH initiated a 911 call.  She called out for the technician to call the store managers for assistance and take over the 911 call. The RPh then stayed with the patient and the mother.

She also felt tingling in both arms, both hands, her face, and torso; she also had a lot of pain in her back. She felt that her face was hot but to the touch it was not.  After about 20 minutes of these sensations her fingers cramped in gnarled positions that she was unable to straighten. Her right hand fingers was more rigid than her left.  This lasted about 30 minutes and then she was slowly able to straighten her fingers.  By the time she went to bed, around 10 pm, she felt basically back to normal.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

                                                Received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday May 16,2021 at around 2:50 pm. At around 7:20 pm on May 16,2021 she stood up to walk to the bathroom. She began feeling nauseous when she stood up. While she was washing her hands, after going to the bathroom, she began to have difficulty with her vision. She describes white and blue dots obstructing her vision in both eyes. She also began to experience loud tinnitus. She described hearing multiple frequencies.  The problem with her vision and the tinnitus continued as she walked through our house to a couch where she laid down. The vision problem and tinnitus continued while she laid on the couch. Her breathing was rapid but she thinks this may have been due to the stress caused by her other symptoms. This episode lasted for several minutes and then the vision problem resolved. The tinnitus continued for several minutes after the vision problem resolved. The intensity of the tinnitus slowly decreased until it finally stopped. The following evening, she experienced tinnitus for a few minutes but it was less intense than it was the previous evening. She very rarely has experienced tinnitus in the past. She has very infrequently experienced brief episodes of orthostatic hypotension when she was dehydrated. When this event occurred, she felt like she was well hydrated. This event lasted much longer and she has never experienced this problem with her vision in the past.

Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

                                                On 5/30/21, patient woke up around 10.30 am and complained of severe headache in back of head (pain level 8-9/10). She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it.

Patients head rolled side to side and patients mom started freaking out thinking she was having a seizure. She screamed at the technician who administered the vaccine to call 911 .  Patient regained consciousness after 10 seconds and was fully alert and able to speak/ answer questions. Pt maintained consciousness the whole time while waiting for the ambulance.  Pt&#39;s mom still wanted an ambulance so one was called and EMT&#39;s came and accessed the patients vitals. Vitals were all within normal limits and EMTs spoke with mom and advised that pt most likely did not have a seizure and gave the option to transport to the hospital or monitor at home. Mom chose to monitor at home and pt was able to walk out of the store on her own.

The following week she had a very heavy period that lasted longer than usual with severe cramps and occasional lightheaded/dizzy spells. After her cycle ended, she continued having  brief episodes of dizziness, usually when going from sitting to standing, usually resolved quickly (after a few minutes) with rest. Over the past two weeks, the episodes have become more frequent and intense, and over the past few days episodes also include s/s of seeing spots and having blurred vision with nausea, SOB, and palpitations/tachycardia. Tonight while at lacrosse practice, pt suddenly became dizzy and felt like she might pass out, became diaphoretic and pale.

                                                Dizziness/lightheadedness; Nausea; Blurred vision; Terrible headache; a little palpitation; Clogged throat; this heaviness (not clarified); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 15-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included no other illness. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously received Amoxicillin, Azithromicin, Cefdinir, Gardasil(Pf) and had allergy. The patient had Nausea that does not go away with Gardasil. She also received HPV vaccine previously and experienced nausea and the dizziness for a month. Reporter stated, &#34;she did not have any allergic &#39;condition&#39; (not clear) but she was allergic, she had always had a rash when she had this Amoxicillin this antibiotic. She was allergic to Penicillin.&#34; The patient had the COVID Pfizer Vaccine on 15May2021 and as soon as she had her first dose she started to feel nausea and dizziness and from there 5 days later she had, she felt a terrible headache, &#39;this heaviness&#39; (not clarified), headache, dizziness, palpitation. The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine. She just wanted to call the Medical Department if she should have the vaccine on Saturday or not. On 15May2021, 4:30 AM, the patient experienced dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, blurred vision, headache, a little palpitation (as reported). The patient received treatment Children allergy medication. Adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care.

Her father was able to support her as she fainted and was lowered gently to the ground in front of the store.  A pharmacy technician was leaving the store simultaneously and upon witnessing the event ran back to the pharmacy to tell me I was needed to assist.  When I arrived, the patient was alert and breathing and able to answer questions regarding personal information, date, time and location.  Patient stated she felt normal other than some tingling sensation in her hands.  Patient reported that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything since waking up that morning.  EMS was already en route, and I observed the patient until they arrived.  Patient has since been transported to the hospital and is currently reported in stable condition.

I noticed her blinking rapidly and stepped out to ask if she was ok, she stated her vision was blurred and then proceeded to have what appeared to be a very brief seizure (5-10 seconds in length) then passed out briefly (10-15 seconds) when she came to she seemed completely normal again.  We had her lie down on the bench and she drank some water, she was sweating more than normal.  After 30 minutes or so she sat up for 5 minutes or so then stood and walked with mom out of store.  Mom called pediatrician to see if they could have her seen.
