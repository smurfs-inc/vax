                                                Swelling of the upper left lip on 05/20/2021 noticed when she woke up at 7am. No signs or history of trauma. Gave Benadryl 25mg liquid orally and iced the area. A second dose of Benadryl was given at 1pm as the swelling had not subsided. By evening her lip was normal.  When waking up on 05/21/2021 she noticed a approx 1cm ulcerative type lesion on her inner upper lip. The lip was swollen again, but slightly less so. Repeated Benadryl 25mg  three times that day at 6 hour intervals. Started on triamcinolone 0.1% cream prescribed by her pediatrician that evening.  On 05/22/2021 the lip was not swollen and the ulcer appears to be healing on the upper lip, but a small portion of her lower left lip now shows an approx 1-2mm ulcerative lesion. Triamcinolone 0.1%cream applied 3x daily.  She noticed a irregular confluent red rash approx 4cmx2cm on her right mid abdomen on Tuesday after swimming, but unsure if this is related.

The client&#39;s father accompanied her, and reported to EMT at 2022 that the client was &#34;hearing echoes.&#34; RN, EMT, and another EMT responded at that time. Per the vaccinating RN, the client had stated that she is afraid of vaccinations and has felt dizzy with previous vaccinations, but the client deferred using the zero gravity chair previously. The client&#39;s skin was pink, warm, and dry; she was alert and oriented. She denied dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or any changes in breathing. At 2026, the client&#39;s vital signs were as follows: heart rate 66, O2 98, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 80/50 (using an adult cuff that was too large for the client). The client&#39;s pulse was normal. The client stated that &#34;this usually happens with shots&#34; and endorsed feeling anxious.

The client was offered water to drink at this time. The father of the client deferred taking benadryl at this time. At 2030, the client stated that all her symptoms had resolved. She appeared to be sitting comfortably in the zero gravity chair and continued to drink water. Education provided regarding recommended observation time, activation and emergency management, and primary care follow up. At 2035, the client was able to stand up without any dizziness, denied any return of the &#34;echoes&#34; or ringing in her ears, and ambulated around the room with a steady gait. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 82/60 with an adult cuff, respiratory rate 22, pulse 64, O2 99.

                                                Patient developed changes in her vision that she reported as black dots on the left side of her vision that lasted roughly 2 minutes. She said she could not see out to the left side of her eye.  This went away after 2 minutes and within 20-30 minutes she developed a severe headache and was in tears from the pain. She has no history of headaches and this has never happened before. She did not report light or sound sensitivity. She did not have any vomiting, but did not want to eat. We consulted her Optometrist and Pediatrician. I gave her Naproxen and caffeine and within 3 hours her headache resolved.

I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

As soon as the needle was withdrawn her eyes rolled over and she slumped in her chair. We ( myself, her mother and her father) where in the process of placing her on the floor when she indicated that she wanted to get up. We placed her back into her seat and her mother proceeded to rub her back. I asked her if she needed anything but she declined. I kept her for observation for 30 minutes monitoring for any signs of shortness of breath, wheezing or swelling of the tongue or throat. No symptoms were observed. I advised her mother to notify patient&#39;s pediatrician of the incident and then released the patient.

                                                My daughter began having a headache a few hours after being vaccinated - that was on Sunday 6/6/21 and we didn&#39;t think much of it. The headache (and fatigue) continued Monday and Tuesday as well. But by that Tuesday afternoon 6/8, she was complaining that her vision was impaired.  She couldn&#39;t see things out of the right corner of her right eye. Example, when she looked at my face she could only see the left half, not the right half. When she looked down at her phone, some numbers on the right side of the screen seemed to be missing from her field of view. Additionally, she said she was having a hard time spelling easy words (ex. &#34;because&#34;) and was processing information really slowly when reading -- she noticed she was going much slower than normal.

She did not have hives but rather papules.  In the office her rash had resolved with the exception of mild erythema. She also complained of an itchy throat but had onset of rhinorrhea and sneezing yesterday.  She took benadryl yesterday which made no difference.  She had no cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting or diarrhea.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

After about 5 minutes of sitting in the chair for her 15 minute observation, her mom said she felt nauseous and like she was going to pass out.  She was laid her back in the chair.  The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

She said her normal vision came back after a couple minutes and her lips no longer numb after about  ~10mins.  I asked if she experienced any other symptoms or her symptoms got worsen.  She answered no.  Right after a few minutes of reporting the symptoms, I asked patient&#39;s mom if  it&#39;s ok for me to call the paramedic.  Her symptoms went away before the paramedic came.  They checked on her pulse and said she&#39;s ok but still took her to monitor for further evaluation.

Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

She was standing in our kitchen at home and became dizzy and started falling backwards. She said her vision was black, she was hot, her head hurt, I could see sweat on her face and chest, and she said she was having tightness in her chest/not able to get full breaths. She didn&#39;t totally lose consciousness, but she was disoriented. These symptoms lasted a few minutes, then she felt fine.

She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

                                                Approximately five minutes after the vaccination, patient became very light-headed and nauseated with loss of vision. She was offered water and hard candy while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. She took a small amount of each, but declined anything else from the store. She seemed to be in significant distress and had difficulty moving to the immunization room where she would be out of view from others in the store. Parmedics arrived and checked her vitals and said those looked ok, so they didn&#39;t seem concerned. Patient still seemed very unsteady when leaving, but did say that her vision had improved. Patients were advised to keep a very close eye on her.

                                                Patient received the first dose of Pfizer on 5/28/21 and during the 15 minute waiting time after the immunization, patient fainted. Patient did not fall or hit head, due to father being in the proximity and able to protect her from hitting the floor. Patient regained consciousness quickly within seconds and was moved to the floor while her feet were elevated. Patient stated that she saw a bit blurry and feeling shaky right before fainting. Patient was seen to be a bit pale in the lips but color came back after a few minutes. When patient&#39;s mother came, it was learned that the patient had a similar experience with an allergy shot in the past. Patient blood pressure was 110/71. Patient laid on the floor for a while before sitting back up.

                                                On the outset: There is no proven link of the vaccine with what happened, but I am filling this just in case you see a pattern emerge: She was vaccinated (pfizer, 1st dose) on Saturday, May 15 2021. A couple of hours later she started experiencing mild symptoms (moderate headache, which we thought as a normal reaction). These persisted on and off  until Wednesday, May 19th, when patient started having swollen and painful glands at the back of her mouth. Long story short, after testing first for strep, followed by blood work, patient&#39;s blood test came back positive with mono on Monday, May 24. The reason for this report is that I have read that mRNA vaccines, great as they may be, may trigger a virus response for viruses that stay within a person - like shingles or herpes etc. The way I understand it, mono also stays with a person. Patient had never been diagnosed with mono before, but mono sometimes does not have symptoms. So, is it possible that she had mono sometime before the vaccine, and it got re-triggered  due to the vaccine? Again, just in case you see a pattern, I am just reporting if helpful. Patient also developed  a mono rash on Wednesday, May 26; treated with topical benadryl cream.

She also felt tingling in both arms, both hands, her face, and torso; she also had a lot of pain in her back. She felt that her face was hot but to the touch it was not.  After about 20 minutes of these sensations her fingers cramped in gnarled positions that she was unable to straighten. Her right hand fingers was more rigid than her left.  This lasted about 30 minutes and then she was slowly able to straighten her fingers.  By the time she went to bed, around 10 pm, she felt basically back to normal.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

                                                Received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday May 16,2021 at around 2:50 pm. At around 7:20 pm on May 16,2021 she stood up to walk to the bathroom. She began feeling nauseous when she stood up. While she was washing her hands, after going to the bathroom, she began to have difficulty with her vision. She describes white and blue dots obstructing her vision in both eyes. She also began to experience loud tinnitus. She described hearing multiple frequencies.  The problem with her vision and the tinnitus continued as she walked through our house to a couch where she laid down. The vision problem and tinnitus continued while she laid on the couch. Her breathing was rapid but she thinks this may have been due to the stress caused by her other symptoms. This episode lasted for several minutes and then the vision problem resolved. The tinnitus continued for several minutes after the vision problem resolved. The intensity of the tinnitus slowly decreased until it finally stopped. The following evening, she experienced tinnitus for a few minutes but it was less intense than it was the previous evening. She very rarely has experienced tinnitus in the past. She has very infrequently experienced brief episodes of orthostatic hypotension when she was dehydrated. When this event occurred, she felt like she was well hydrated. This event lasted much longer and she has never experienced this problem with her vision in the past.

Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

                                                The evening of the vaccine Maddison had slightly labored breathing, pins and needles feelings in feet and hands. Fever, body aches. The morning after while taking their temperature, Maddison said she couldn&#39;t see anything then fell into my arms. Her pupils quickly dilated, she made gutteral sounds while shaking slightly then lost consciousness. I couldn&#39;t see her breathing for about 15 seconds and she was confused when she came to. She couldn&#39;t hear, see or speak during the episode. We took her to the emergency room where a chest xray and ekg came back clear.

A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it. The blotchiness and chest pain resolved quickly, but the itchiness continued. Patient also complained of stomach pain, which occurred after patient&#39;s grandmother gave her a loratadine. The loratadine settled the itching down, but patient reported nausea the next morning and shortness of breath, as well. Patient received Claritin 24 Hr for the events as treatment. The outcome of the skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs and chest hurting was recovered on May-2021 and recovered for rest of the events in 2021  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.
