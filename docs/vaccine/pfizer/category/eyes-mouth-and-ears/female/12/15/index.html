Pt was initially not responsive, when transferred to a wheel chair to take her to a gurney, left arm &amp; left leg jerk twice. Took her to lay down and check her blood pressure. En route, in the wheel chair within about 5 to 10 seconds, she became responsive and said she could not see. Her vision returned to normal within a minute. Her initial blood pressure was 97/64 with O2 Sat 100% on room air. Her skin temp was 95.5, and her HR was 95. She continued to be responsive with excellent oxygenation and When the EMTs arrived she had a blood sugar of 90 and improving blood pressure with a regular rate and rhythm. Her diaphoresis resolved, and she continued to improve, tolerating water. Had similar reaction last year to flu shot, no hx of seizures

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

                                                So the patient complained of weird vision and  her lower lip felt a bit numb.  She said her normal vision came back after a couple minutes and her lips no longer numb after about  ~10mins.  I asked if she experienced any other symptoms or her symptoms got worsen.  She answered no.  Right after a few minutes of reporting the symptoms, I asked patient&#39;s mom if  it&#39;s ok for me to call the paramedic.  Her symptoms went away before the paramedic came.  They checked on her pulse and said she&#39;s ok but still took her to monitor for further evaluation.
