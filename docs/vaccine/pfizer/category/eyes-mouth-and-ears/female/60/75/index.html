                                                Blurred vision that was mild in nature (but noticeable, nonetheless). Began 15 minutes after vaccine received. Lasted 10 minutes. Resolved on its own. NOT accompanied by any other effect (i.e. nausea, vertigo, lightheadedness); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 23Dec2020 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on an unspecified date and Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on the left breast in 2008. Concomitant medications included omeprazole and cetirizine (CETIRIZINE). On 23Dec2020 at 10:30, the patient had a blurred vision that was mild in nature (but noticeable, nonetheless). It began 15 minutes after vaccine received and lasted for 10 minutes. It resolved on its own and not accompanied by any other effect (i.e. nausea, vertigo, lightheadedness). No therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event. Clinical outcome of the event was recovered on 23Dec2020 at 10:40.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 14:56 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension, previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic.  Concomitant medication included nifedipine, carvedilol.  Consumer stated, &#34;About 15 minutes into after getting the injection, I was sitting to the site they asked me to stay longer because I previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic (Unspecified Medication).So that was within the 15 minute mark I started getting ringing in my ears and at the 20 mark I had migraine. I had them since I was about 9, they were diagnosed, it triggered a migraine. Although the ringing had gotten better in the last year but it is really bad in the right and it is now causing me (incomplete sentence).&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;I am probably say like I am yelling at you. I cannot hear and my son keeps telling me mom you are yelling. I did not see that I am &#39;ringing to your sheath&#39; ringing in the ear, the headache. I just see my headache is better today. I had a little bit of it but nothing you know Excedrin or something would take care of not enough for me to go take that but it is the ringing and I cannot hear out of that ear. I put my phone up and ringed up. Consumer stated, &#34;Recently my mom had COVID (further not clarified), I barely heard it. On the 23rd of Dec and I keep in contact with my family,they are 13 of us and I picked up the phone and instinctively put it to my right ear, I could not hear and I kept looking at the phone and I thought wait a minute and I put it to my left seems to be okay. It is the right I cannot hear.&#34;  Consumer further added, &#34;I am a Nurse so you expect this, that is why I waited this long because I got the injection at like 3 O&#39;clock yesterday and I waited even longer thinking maybe it will just go away and So I know you guys want to know everything that is going on. So I said wise better to call.&#34; Date of vaccination: Consumer stated, &#34;04Jan2021 (Clarified as 04Jan2021) and the time was 2:56 PM.&#34; Consumer further added, &#34;It is the only thing I could think of. It is the only thing that I could think of that I did differently out of my daily habits to go get this injection. I would say within 15 minutes it just started turning my head and I was like wait a minute I am having ringing and then they had music playing above our head, it sounded like everything was muffled then I turn my head to the right I could hear better and they kept turning my head and one of the administrators at the table started looking at me so I get up and I said you know what I am having ringing in my ear so they had me seated there a bit longer.&#34; Dose and route of administration: Consumer stated, &#34;I think she pulled up one cc that I saw and I got it in my left deltoid.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;No.&#34; Causality: Consumer stated, &#34;I would have to say because it  started like say in the 15 minute mark and then the headache came in about 20 minute mark.&#34; The outcome of the event Headache was resolved while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                On 12-24-2020 I started to have a metallic taste in my mouth and at 2:35pm I experienced rapid  heart beat with chest tightness. On the next day I  felt two places in body begin with hives and it grew with itchiness till the third day.  I had under-skin itchiness which grew  into hives. I did a telemedicine consult with a doctor who started me on Benadryl, for me to take it 3 times a day for Monday and Tuesday after Christmas (12-28-2020 and 12-29-2020).

The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130.

She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room. The patient had reactions: itching, rash, swelling, welts, shingle like rash on tailbone, genital area, hips moving to her face, itching and inflammation, in eyes as well. She wanted to know if the 2nd dose was recommended. It was &#34;like an anaphylactic reaction but not in her throat.&#34; itching around the genital area, vulva started from 04Jan2021, vulva was swollen started from 05Jan2021; Rash vulva started from 06Jan2021 to 10Jan2021; rash down her thighs started from 07Jan2021; Raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles started from 06Jan2021, whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy from 07Jan2021; itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see started from 06Jan2021; raised itchy area on her left cheek and eyes started from 07Jan2021; Headache dull started from 06Jan2021. The events Headache dull, itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see; whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy and raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles were reported as non-serious by the reporter and other events were considered as medical significant by the reporter. Investigation assessment for the events was reported as No. The outcome of the event anaphylactic reaction, inflammation in eye, welts was unknown, outcome of the event Rash vulva was recovered on 10Jan2021; of Headache dull, swelling eye was not recovered, of other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills. Pain in calves, upper back, same on both sides.  6:38 weirdly, from the bottom of my thumb to halfway up my arm there is pain. Both arms simultaneously. Worse on the  left.  8:11 pm after bundling up and using a heating pad, plus extra heat, chills are lessened. Lymph nodes very sore in neck. Eyes are not quite as dry. Everything else is the same.  8:48 pm jaw really aches. Intestinal discomfort. Going to bed.  10:39 pm pain from jaw extended up into left ear. Upper part of throat hurts.  March 5, 2021  4:00 am. Body aches have lessened. Left arm sore at shot area.  5:45 am  eyes definitely dry, but not nearly as dry as yesterday. Numbness in mouth , tongue and face has lessened, but still uncomfortably present. Definitely worse on the left side. Little bit of tingling on the left, mostly on cheek from chin to ear. Headache gone. Lymph nodes sore and swollen .  7:00 am went on a walk. Noticed some achyness throughout body. Very tired.  10:51 am The tingling and numbness remain in my mouth, tongue and cheek up to my left eye.  Very tired. Lymph nodes still swollen and sore.

After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

                                                About 30 minutes after taking the vaccine, when I was driving home, my face got very hot and red. I also started feeling lightheaded like I might faint. I pull over into a parking lot and had a family member come get me to drive me home. I was extremely thirsty and drank a lot of water at home. Eventually, my redness went away and my face did not feel as hot.  I did feel other more typical symptoms too such as painful arm, and flu like symptoms. I am mainly concerned about the reaction I had when driving home since it was similar to what happens when I take cortisone or Doxycycline.  I am needing information as to whether it is safe for me to take my second dose of the covid vaccine.

At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

I left the center after 15 minutes and came back to Pediatric office where I work.  I did take a Zyrtec and felt completely better after approx. an hour.  After the 2nd dose I did mention I had felt odd after 1st dose and decided to sit for 30 min.  I felt about the same as I did after the 1st dose so I left.  when  I got to my car my face was flushed.  I was not tachycardia just a very odd felling in my head and then my tongue did start to itch (or feel funny)  .  I took a Zyrtec and went home.  I never had any swelling of lips or tongue, no trouble breathing.  Pulse stayed constant around 80.  This time the symptoms lasted approx. 4 hours.  I I did continue to take Zyrtec for 3 days after injection.

A contactable consumer reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 report.   A 61-year-old female consumer (patient) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Covid Vaccine, lot number: EL1248) on 06Jan2021 at single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant drug included Multivitamin, Vitamin C, Vitamin D Zinc all from Mar2020 and ongoing. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EK5730) on 18Dec2020 in the right arm. Patient got COVID vaccine and a few hours later or the next day she started getting a hole in her retina and started losing her site in right eye. she went to the doctor as she has a hole in her retina. Again, this may be totally unrelated but she wanted to call and get this reported. She is going to see a retinal specialist this afternoon. After she had her COVID vaccine she had a bad headache for 3 days. She wore sunglasses in her house because the light bothered her eyes. She noticed this on 16Jan2021 because she was looking at paperwork and her eyes felt dry. She blinked a few times and had opened one eye alone, and she noticed that her left eye was fine but the vision in her right was not. This could have been going on longer. She just never closes only one eye. When both are open, her vision is normal. She saw the eye doctor yesterday, and that is when they said she had a hole in her retina. They said she will have to have surgery to close the hole. She knows she is at the right age for this to spontaneously happen, but just in case it is related, she wanted to report it. Outcome of the event Loss of vision in right eye was Not Recovered, for headache was recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

                                                Patient received her second Pfizer covid vaccine on Tuesday 4/6/21. She said she had been doing yard work before she came to get her vaccine. After she received her vaccine she felt fine. On Tuesday night she started to feel some itchiness. She said the itchiness got worse over the next two days. She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient vision wasn&#39;t as good. She also had glasses to read (eyeglass wearer and ongoing) and behind her eyes they were dry one (left) mostly. Concomitant medications included unspecified beta blockers. On 11Mar2021, she got chills on the same day. Right as she got the shot, she wanted to vomit also and got shaky. On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn&#39;t as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn&#39;t as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn&#39;t even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn&#39;t know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn&#39;t get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that&#39;s happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There&#39;s pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn&#39;t. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that&#39;s weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced. The patient recovered from breath sounds abnormal and constipation on 12Mar2021; cardiospasm, chills and vaccination site pain in Mar2021 while the remaining events were unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer vaccination #1 on April 8 at 9:15am.  Almost immediately the hearing in my right ear started to shut down/muffle.  Today is April 22 and the problem persists.  After researching online I will not take the second dose, scheduled for April 29 at 12:30pm, for fear of worsened and/or permanent damage.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing disability and gait disturbance (difficulty ambulating long distances due to being disabled). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. During the patient&#39;s 15-minute waiting period after the vaccination, the patient began to experience funny taste in her mouth (somewhat metallic like). Treatment included antihistamines (unspecified). The response to treatment was good. The patient was doing well upon discharge/leaving. She was escorted out via wheelchair only due difficulty ambulating long distances due to being disabled but is otherwise at baseline. The outcome of the event was recovering (reported as &#34;reports some improvement in change in taste prior to discharge/leaving&#34;). The reporter assessed this case as non-serious.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

EMTs were called but I didn&#39;t go to the hospital.  My son picked me up and took me home because I was unable to drive.  On the way I experienced loss of vision and speech for about 5 minutes.  When I got home, my legs were so shaky that I had to have help walking.  I started getting severe chills that took 3 hours to get warm (2 heavy blankets, space heater, and heating pad).  I was very fatigued and felt bad the rest of the day.  (Saturday)The next day I had flu-like symptoms; headache, joint aches, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue.  Sunday was better but still had to rest most of the day because when I would stay up for over 30 minutes, the symptoms would return.  Monday-  stomach cramps, headache, fatigue  but went to work (30 minutes late due to stomach) and left 30 minutes early.

                                                I had to get cleared by a allergist prior to getting the vaccine due to my prior history allergy history. I was advised by the allergist to take Allegra an hour before receiving the vaccine. About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I started to throat my started to feel dry and tickling, it felt like it swelling starting from the left side to the center, I started having difficulties swallowing my salvia and any fluid. My blood pressure was checked and it was elevated.  I started to have difficulty breathing. They transferred me over to the ER. They gave me IV medicines Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid (I think). After 6 hours I was able to go home. Everything went back to normal besides the pain in the left arm at injection site.   I had a telemedicine visit today with my primary care physician to follow up.

As time went on pain worsened and radiated into my cheek, left eye and left ear.  ~ One week later, I saw a dentist; he couldn&#39;t say whether it was TMJ or tooth problem, so sent me home w/quick splint to separate my top &amp; bottom teeth at night and some exercises.  These didn&#39;t help, so ~ a week after that, he gave  me antibiotic.  No improvement in symptoms until ~ a week after that.  I saw pcp, as it felt like something was crawling inside my left ear.  Ears were fine; she agreed w/inconclusive answer of dentist - at this point, there was some improvement in my symptoms.  She suggested prescription-strength Naproxen for 10 days, which I did.  the pain/ache has been mostly gone since completing the Naproxen.  For last few weeks, I&#39;ve been back to normal - no ache/pain/strange sensations in ear at all.

This 62 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3246) on 19Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 62 years old), in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) or on the same day: none. Medical history included ongoing trigeminal neuralgia (she had nerve issues, clarifying she was diagnosed about 6-1/2 years ago with trigeminal neuralgia that caused right-sided pain in her head and in her right ear), Raynaud&#39;s in her hands and feet since she was a kid. The patient previously took a 7-day course of levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and after that she had a diagnosis of ongoing erythromelalgia in her hands and feet and permanent ringing in ears, both since 2014, after she took, saying she functioned fine with the permanent ringing in her ears, she had gotten used it. She also felt horrible and had a muscle tear in her right arm a week after taking Levaquin. Concomitant medication included nortriptyline 20 mg capsule once daily (at night), ongoing since about 6-1/2 years ago, for trigeminal neuralgia. On 19Jan2021, 3 hours after vaccination, the patient experienced itching on the left side of her tongue. On the same day she had a little bit of swelling on the left side of her tongue. She took 1 generic 25 mg tablet of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) at 19:30 and was okay and slept fine. The next day it felt different but it wasn&#39;t itching. She had other autoimmune type things going on. Since an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient had been having more ear pain and usually took medicine for this but had not had ear pain in awhile. The patient said the left side of her tongue itching and swelling was enough to make her concerned. She also said she was concerned that there may be something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will activate her nerve issue since her right ear had been hurting her since Feb2021. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather was causing her right ear pain, but she had been on medication for over 6 years now that had been taking care of her right ear pain. She said she did not want to have the second COVID-19 vaccine injection if it was going to set off her nerve issue. She stated the doctors were thinking that she should get it but staying there and be monitored and not get it on her day off. She would be getting it at the student health center where she worked so she could be monitored and would have access to medical treatment if needed. Relevant tests: none. The events did not require ER visit or physician office visit. Itching on the left side of her tongue resolved on 19Feb2021. Swelling of tongue resolved on 20Feb2021. The other events outcome was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  autoimmune disorder and other events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including autoimmune panel, ANA and ESR, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

This consumer (patient) reported that a 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 62-years, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hadn&#39;t had her period for 8 years. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historically received first single dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 62-years for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine last Friday 19Feb2021, when she was driving home her eyes was runny, sort of hurting like salt in her eye, it was like that all evening she had to put a patch on her eye to help it. That same evening may arm was hurting where she got the vaccine in the right arm, and the lymph node under her arm got inflamed. The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body. Consumer added that she read on line that patients should wait for 5months before going to their doctor about the swollen lymph nodes because they might send the person for a test, mammogram and it may say they have cancer, in the clinical trials apparently some patients has issues with their lymph nodes and when they did testing it was found they had cancer, but it was not cancer it was the vaccine. Outcome of the event she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed was recovered/resolved in Feb2021; of the armpit swelling was not recovered/not resolved; while of remain was unknown.  Information on lot/batch has been requested.

A 62-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN8203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 04Mar2021, reports getting the vaccine on 04Mar2021 and has had a large cyst on the left side of her jaw, sore right jaw with clicking sounds and tingling on the left leg, an hour and a half after. Also reported difficulty swallowing. Reported that she had reactions, not immediately, but 1 hour and 15 minutes after the vaccine. Caller reports a large dime size knot on the left side of jaw, right at temporo mandibular joint (TMJ) area. Injection was on left side. Caller reported that minutes later, her jaw got very sore like it started popping out of joint, and couldn&#39;t open wide. She also states that she had tingling down the left leg, down to the toes, left leg only. States this all happen pretty much right at the same time, maybe 5-10 minutes of each thing happening. She is at home with grandson. She was on hold for a while already. Weird reactions, not the common ones. States that she is not going to take the second vaccine, is afraid to take it. At this point, it is just a hard knot (described as a large dime size knot), and he (the doctor) said to take a Benadryl, which she did. Knot, hardness resolved gone by 06Mar2021, but a pimple remained for 7 days. The outcome of the event jaw disorder, jaw pain, was recovered on an unspecified date, for the event tingling of extremity was recovered on 04Mar2021, for the event large dime size knot on the left side of jaw, right at TMJ area;hardness  was recovered on 06Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.   No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected. Batch/lot number already provided; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the close temporal association (reportedly, the reactions occurred  hour and 15 minutes after the vaccine), a causal association between the reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be  excluded.

Concomitant medication included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) taken as Dose increased to twice in the morning daily for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing, (Lot number: 0014678, ; Expiration Date: Jan20230); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) 500 taken as Dose increased from once daily to twice daily an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride (Lot Number: 3N2E, Expiration Date: Feb2022), fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing (Lot number: GA00510, Expiration date: May2022); prednisone (PREDNISONE) taken for an unspecified indication with quantity of 27, Dose: 3-20mg daily for 7 days, then 2-20mg daily for 2 days, then 1-20mg daily for 3 days and Ongoing therapy. She also used a nose spray that didn&#39;t work so they switched her back to Dymista nose spray.   Consumer stated that she received both doses of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had reactions to both of them. Consumer stated that, &#34;The second dose was even worse. They put her on Prednisone. She did not know if she should be tested again or not? She was sitting up but she could not walk around anywhere. She had 2 broken knees. She could not walk anywhere. After the second dose, they had to bring her to the hospital because she couldn&#39;t even walk to her car. She got home and she had been sick ever since. She had allergies too. She could not do anything. she had a hard time breathing. she was hesitant to get the 2nd one, but everybody said to get it. Her IgG level was down to 300 something. She was also tapering off of prednisone and she did not want to be tapering off it because it was worked well for her. She could tell by her breathing that it was helped her. She could taste sodium in her mouth constantly since she had got the vaccination.&#34; Second dose completed her prescribed therapy. Dates for Symptoms From 15Mar2021 to Ongoing Reported seriousness for Symptoms reported as Unspecified and the Symptoms was reported as worsened. Patient&#39;s doctor dropped her last week, told her she didn&#39;t know what to do with her, and that this was too stressful.  Onset of symptoms following first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine was on 17Mar2021. She couldn&#39;t breathe very well when she went in for the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She was ok the first day after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, seemed ok, arm didn&#39;t hurt; but then had onset of symptoms. She has been in bed the whole time since onset of symptoms, was in bed for over 2 weeks. She slept for 2 days straight, only got up for water and the bathroom. It was bad, getting hard to breathe. She had to use her emergency inhaler. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine messed up her Meniere&#39;s disease. Doctor started patient on Prednisone for these symptoms, and Prednisone is really the only thing that clears up Meniere&#39;s disease because her ears was full and she could not get up. Prednisone helped her and I relayed in her &#39;rescue&#39; inhalers (treatment) because she did 2 in the morning, two inhalers anyway when she started to feel better, she got her second one and it made her worst.  She did not eat anything salty or anything, the barometric pressure was not bad. It was really funny because she had just finished everything and it was a few days before she had to go get her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine shot. She was just starting to feel normal, at least normal for her, she could get up normal and drive. They gave her the second shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and it was like a double. She clarified as she got like double the amount of symptoms that she had experienced following the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  She is tasting sodium in her mouth from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She can&#39;t have much sodium which struck up the Meniere&#39;s disease really bad the second day after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine; her allergies in her head went bonkers. She could not talk, it was closing up her throat, she was coughing every time she eats or dinks, and she&#39;s having a &#34;really bad&#34; adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the second dose. They had to take her out of the hospital to her car in a wheelchair &#34;right after&#34; getting the second shot. She could not get more than 1000 mg of sodium a day, she tastes it in her mouth constantly, she could not get rid of it and it was &#34;going through her system&#34;. She wanted to know what to do, since her doctor told her to contact Pfizer. She wanted to know what part of the vaccine is doing that, she assures it is sodium, because sodium is in her mouth 24/7 and she could not get it out, she could not have that much sodium in her body. It was still getting really hard to breathe. She is still taking the Prednisone she was initially prescribed and started on for the symptoms that started after her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She is tapering off of Prednisone, and she shouldn&#39;t be tapering off, she thinks she needs to be Prednisone for some more days, maybe 3 more days, then she would be ok. It was prescribed as a 7-day burst of Prednisone. She mentioned that the only Prednisone that works on her is the Actavis manufactured Prednisone; her pharmacy orders it for her because they know that. She called the emergency room Saturday when she was really bad. They said they had a line there and it was going to be at least a 4 hour wait. With patient&#39;s low immune system, Meniere&#39;s disease and that she could hardly breathe she did not go to the emergency room because she could catch something and die while waiting. She decided she would just stay at home and rest. She has not had any Physician&#39;s office visit relative to event; she has a telephone appointment tomorrow to see if the doctor is going to be her doctor. She had to cancel her appointment with the doctor today because if she has something she doesn&#39;t want to spread it, she feels worse now and with the Meniere&#39;s she is tasting sodium in her mouth constantly from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, she does not eat a lot of salt. The flu shot takes her a couple of days, then she is right back up and Vaccination Last dose on Oct2020. Consumer stated that she has &#39;Meniere&#39;s&#39; disease (History) and it made her worse. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG level: 300. Reporter stated the seriousness for the events was Unspecified. Seriousness of event Meniere&#39;s disease aggravated was medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                On Friday, January 15 at approximately 6 PM while seated in a reclining chair watching television I started to develop hives below my right gluteal fold. Over the next six hours  approximately 300 hives appeared on my skin. They were very itchy. At approximately midnight my lip began to swell and being a certified registered nurse anesthetist,  who lives alone, I knew it was time to head to the ER. Prior to going to the ER  I  cleaned the lesions With alcohol, took prednisone 10 mg PO,  and applied hydrocortisone cream.    In the ER, I was given Benadryl 50 mg PO and Pepcid 20 mg and observed for one hour. The hives remained but there was no respiratory compromise. Approximately six hours later the hives were still increasing in size and number, were unbearably itchy and my swollen lips had not subsided.  I took Claritin 10 mg PO and returned to the same ER and was given Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, prednisone 20 mg po and observed for three hours. The hives did not decrease and again there was no respiratory compromise so I was sent home on prednisone And a H-1 blocker.  Of note, both my palms and lips have been bright cherry red.     I finished a five day course of Macrobid on January 13 at 10 AM.    Final diagnosis:  Alergic  reaction

A 63-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: ELD14D, via an unspecified route of administration, in left side of arm, on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included early breast cancer from 2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included tamoxifen citrate 20 mg tablet by mouth once daily from 2017 and ongoing for breast cancer (cancer pill, she has to be on it for 5 years). The patient received the vaccine as she is &#34;with fire department, thought she needed to take it, she had early breast cancer, is around lots of people&#34;. On 09Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, assessed as medically significant and in Jan2021 she experienced earache (she thought it was an earache, but it was more than that, but it made her ear hurt, and she has no infection), her mouth was drawled a little, further detailed as numbness and &#34;the eye, it is messing with it, when she is trying to see out of it, she can see, but it&#39;s blurry like&#34; and, &#34;where the ear thing is&#34;, on the back of the lymph node was real sore and her face was kind of puffy, which is the reason she went to the doctor. The patient had to go to her doctor, he told her she had a reaction to the shot, he called it Bell&#39;s Palsy, and said to let Pfizer know. Her doctor gave her something to take for mouth drawled/numbness, which is supposed to help, and she has to go back in a week. The event Bell&#39;s palsy outcome was unknown at the time of the report.

A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176/expiration date) dose number 2 intramuscularly on 08Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. Medical history included severe allergic reaction to pecans and tinnitus. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (dose number 1, intramuscularly on the left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced tinnitus, sinus infection, and stuffy head after the first dose. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks and no other medications were taken within 2 weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. On 08Jan2021, after the 2nd dose, the patient experienced itching across shoulders/back of neck and sl nausea. She took Benadryl which relieved the itching. She went to bed and had onset of body aches, chills, and sense the she couldn&#39;t get a good breath. She felt like there was a tight band around chest. Her O2 Sat was 95% - 98%, with pulse of 101-129, T max was 101.8. The symptoms were lasting about 6 hours. In the morning, the patient took Aleve and Benadryl. Most symptoms were alleviated. She took those meds scheduled for 48 hrs. She noticed that if she tried to push past scheduled time, the itching started to return, so she just kept the meds scheduled for 48 hours. No other symptoms after that. She added that she had tinnitus, and she noticed that both injections made that worse. It was not yet subsiding since last injection. The patient also received Tylenol for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021.

                                                I was okay during the 30 minute observation period, and was discharged.  Between 1 and 1:30 am, about 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up from my sleep suddenly, with an acute episode of chest tightness, cough, severe running nose and lacrimation.  I did not have hives or lip/throat itching or swelling. I felt a little warm in the face. I took Ventolin inhaler two puffs twice 30 minutes apart &#43; Aller-flo nasal sprays. I began to feel a bit better and then took Benadryl 25 mgms (because of my history of Angioedema) around 2:30 am. I feel better now, which is 12 hours after onset of episode, but had to take Ventolin inhaler this morning for a bit of chest tightness. I do not have a history of asthma, but have had seasonal allergies in past years. But if this is seasonal allergy, it is very unusual, since I have never had an acute episode like this without any early milder symptoms. And I haven&#39;t needed Ventolin in a couple of years. I am now concerned about taking the second dose.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

On Monday (18Jan2021), she started getting a slight sore throat and yesterday (19Jan2021), she has had mild, vague symptoms but she ended up with a really bad headache last night along with a sore throat. She is a school nurse and she has had possible exposure to a student that was positive for COVID. She feels like she has very vague, normal sinus-like symptoms. She added that she had Covid exposure on an unspecified date, as she is a school nurse and had contact with a Covid-positive patient. She stated that the contact with a known-positive Covid patient since receiving her first vaccine. She mentioned that she does have chronic sinusitis, so the sore throat is post-nasal drip, and a headache. However, this headache is worse than the headache she has had in the past. She hasn&#39;t had any sinus symptoms for the past 5 months, but she was thinking about getting a COVID test to rule this out. She explained that she is due for her second vaccine one week from today and wanted to know can she still get the second COVID vaccine if she was not feeling well on an unspecified date. She was trying to determine if she does have COVID. She inquired if getting the vaccine automatically turn a COVID test positive if she has already received the first COVID vaccine.

She doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine and she doesn&#39;t think she is having adverse reactions. She has gone through 12 days without having any symptoms, she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a reaction. She stated she either has been exposed to COVID or she is getting a sinus infection. She just started having these symptoms. It&#39;s not abnormal for her, but this time since she is getting the second vaccine, she wanted to know can she go ahead and still get the vaccine if she is still having any residual symptoms. The patient clarified that she got a COVID test (non-rapid test) this morning (20Jan2021) but she has not yet received her results.

Went to be early at 9:30 and awoke at one a.m.on February 26 with splitting headache.  Could not get back to sleep well and felt terrible all that  day with headache, nausea, and foggy thinking, not funcional after about 2:30 p.m.  Took Ibuprofen at 3 p.m., called doctor and went to ER at Medical Center.  Was seen at ER a few hours later.  Slept some in waiting room. Had sore throat, the worst splitting migraine type headache ever, and was extremely foggy headed, couldn&#39;t process thoughts, eyes had difficulty focusing, nausea.  My temperature was a little high for me, I am normally low and it was 99.  My blood pressure is usually low and it was 105/59, pulse was 82 and respiration was 16 with 96 % Oxygen Saturation. They did tests and had an ophthalmoligist give me an exam also.  They said I could go home with the same meds they were giving me in the hospital since they were working to alleviate my painful headache, 600 mg of ibuprofen, reglan and benadryl.  Before I left they gave me the potassium chloride. I am continuing my medications today, two days after my vaccine.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 16:32 (Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers (She cannot wear polyester and she has to wear 100% cotton). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient (at the age of 62-year-old) previously received the second dose of Shingles Vaccine in Jan2021 for immunization. The patient experienced really bad headache, excruciating headache on 09Mar2021 21:00, nauseous, nausea/queasy on 09Mar2021, she had soreness in the arm on 05Mar2021, blurred vision on 09Mar2021, holes in her vision on 09Mar2021, not right on 09Mar2021, like an allergic reaction on 09Mar2021. She developed a &#34;really bad headache&#34; around 9pm on Tuesday 09Mar2021, that caused holes in her vision and pain &#34;straight across my forehead&#34;. She did treat with Tylenol and was able to finally sleep around 5am. She states that the headache has persisted, and she&#39;s felt &#34;nauseous, queasy, and not right&#34; since the headache started.  She is hesitant to get the second dose. She was experiencing headache following. She mentioned she is allergic to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and polymers, and thought maybe the headache was a result of an allergy to the vaccine? Ingredients don&#39;t appear to have any of her reported allergens. She had soreness in the arm the first 48 hours, which was to be expected and no big deal for her. However, starting on Tuesday, she had an excruciating headache. She normally does not typically get headaches. She believes in vaccinations and as a teacher the minute she could sign up to get one she did. Now she is terrified to get the second one. When this excruciating headache began she woke her husband up to tell what happened. She thought she was going to die, that is how bad it was and she wanted him to be aware and prepared if anything should happen. The excruciating headache started at 9PM. It was excruciating all night. The headache made her queasy because she hurt so bad. It continued into Wednesday. Today and today the pain is duller in her head, much duller than it was. However, she still feels queasy/nauseous. The headache also started with blurred vision. The blurred vision has gone away. It was like there were holes in the TV. She was thinking  it was interesting and did not think much of it at first. She thought one of her contacts had a hole in it, but she did not even have any on. The blurred vision lasted 24 hours. The soreness in arm lasted until Sunday or Monday. She confirmed the pain in arm is gone and was gone by Monday. She initially could not wait to get her shot. Now she is terrified to get the second one. She took Tylenol in the middle of the night on Tuesday and Wednesday for the headache. Has allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers. She cannot wear polyester. She has to wear 100% cotton. She is questioning if the vaccine has polymers in it. From what she heard it does and is wondering if this caused her to have like an allergic reaction. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered in Mar2021, the events Nauseous and headache was not recovered, other events was unknown.

                                                Tingling on her lip/ zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip; tingle on the right hand finger/ electrical feeling; sharp pain in her breast/ painful zinging sensation on her right breast; excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf; pain that came up the outside left ankle/ zinging sensation left ankle; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 63-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Mar2021 11:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history predating treatment with the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine included fracture on that left foot where the toenail came off and she had a wound that wouldn&#39;t heal. She was fully recovered from the foot injury in Dec2020. Then she came down with a positive COVID 19 test on 11Dec2020. Symptoms started on 07Dec2021 with a fever and everything and she ended up in the ER with bilateral pneumonia and they sent her home on 17Dec2020. Then later, she was admitted to the hospital on 25Dec2020 with excruciating pain in her chest, lungs and legs; and she was having shortness of breath. She was found to have a  DVT, PE and bilateral pneumonia. She was discharged 30Dec2020. She thinks she has the long time syndrome after COVID. She was still having shortness of breath, itchiness, and extreme fatigue from the COVID 19 infection but her HCP advised her to get the COVID 19 vaccine anyway. She thinks the chest congestion and cough were cleared up now, but she has noticed hair loss. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient stated that her husband, son and herself received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 02Mar2021. They all waited the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine for a reaction and was fine. Her husband and son went ahead to the car and she went to use the restroom. 20 minutes later, while in the restroom, she got a random ting outside her left foot like an electrical type very painful pain that came up the outside left ankle, leg, and calf. She had an excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf/ zinging sensation left ankle on 02Mar2021. The pain was from the same foot that she had broken before. It happened once and she was like what was that and then it stopped. Maybe 5 seconds went by then it happened again this random zap of electrical feeling that she cant really explain but it gave her whole body goosebumps. It did it 5 times in a row with pauses in between in the same exact place left lower leg. After it stopped and as she was washing her hands she had a really sharp pain in her breast on 02Mar2021 and then that was it. She walked out to the car and she didn&#39;t say anything to her husband or son because she didn&#39;t really understand what was happening and she felt fine other than the crazy pain and once it ended it ended. When she got home and in the afternoon because she was home working remotely it happened again the same exact spot left lower leg and the pain was excruciating when it was happening. This time she thinks it was four times in a row with pauses in between same exact spot just in her left lower leg. This time she told her husband &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything before but its happening again and its weird.&#34; She never had this feeling before. Adds it was so excruciating. She was just holding her breath counting how many times it will occur. It happened again that night and then she almost afraid to go to sleep because the pain would wake her up but nothing happened as she slept. She woke up the next morning and had to go to an ophthalmologist appointment and happened again while she was sitting in the chair. She had another episode of the painful zing in her foot. That was the last time it did and it might have happened again but altogether she had 4-5 episodes in a 24 hour period after receiving the vaccine. Each time she would have several painful zings. She also noticed a tingling on her lip on 03Mar2021; a painful zinging sensation on her right breast; and a tingling sensation on one finger of her hand that happened one time on 03Mar2021. That day, she had a tingling in one finger and a zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip and that was it those didn&#39;t really bother her they were more tingling and electrical feeling. She called her primary doctor and he hadn&#39;t heard of anything like it before but he cant rule it out. He said the only way you would know is if you got the shot again but she states she is a little scared. She would like to know if this side effect has been reported before and if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She was scheduled to receive the next dose on next Tuesday, 23Mar2021. She mentioned she had blood work this week but she has no results at this time. The outcome of sharp pain in her breast/ painful zinging sensation on her right breast was recovered on 02Mar2021, of excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf was recovered on 03Mar2021, of pain that came up the outside left ankle/ zinging sensation left ankle was recovered on 04Mar2021, of tingling on her lip/ zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip was recovered on 03Mar2021, and of tingle on the right hand finger/ electrical feeling was  recovered on 03Mar2021.

She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu.

She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021.

She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

                                                Woke up around 3:30 am on 02Apr2021 with a rapid heart rate; rush through her body from feet to head, very rapid heart rate (fluttering); tongue-tingling; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (patient) reporting for herself. A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 01Apr2021 08:45 (at the age of 63-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included exercise-induced asthma, SVT (Supraventricular tachycardia). Concomitant medication included sotalol. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin and diazepam (VALIUM) and had allergies to both. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccine on 01Apr2021 (08:50), the patient experienced a rush through her body from feet to head, very rapid heart rate (fluttering) which lasted approximately 1min, tongue-tingling which lasted approx. 8 hours. Woke up around 3:30 am on 02Apr2021 with a rapid heart rate. She notified her PCP and cardiologist&#39;s office that morning. There was no treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the event tongue-tingling on 01Apr2021 16:50. The outcome of the event rapid heart rate was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and known vaccine safety profile, the causal association between the event of a rush through her body from feet to head, very rapid heart rate (fluttering) is assessed as unrelated to the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 and more likely due to the possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and/or concomitant medications. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Don&#39;t know if this happened when she got Hashimoto&#39;s, Thyroid, ongoing Vestibular Issues Started 5 years ago. States one doctor thinks it is her bad neck. States when she got old things shifted and changed. One ENT said she has neuritis, where something hit her ear nerve in right ear. States hence that was what the acyclovir was for, when she feels an earache coming on, she takes acyclovir. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). AEs following prior vaccinations: None; reported she hadn&#39;t had any flu vaccines in years because of the ingredients.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto&#39;s - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn&#39;t mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn&#39;t have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn&#39;t walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can&#39;t walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn&#39;t , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven&#39;t had it since. It&#39;s almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could&#39;ve affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn&#39;t know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn&#39;t know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn&#39;t want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can&#39;t explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn&#39;t want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn&#39;t mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn&#39;t really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn&#39;t know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles. All events (AEs) did not require a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office. The events of Tunnel vision, rush of pressure to back of head and the lower part of head, Headache, dizzy/Dizziness/light headed, cloudy and pressure in her ears/Ear Pressure, was recovered on 01Apr2021, of my arm started to really hurt/Sore Arm; sore to touch was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

Control No.: 21K-163-3848385-00). A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6207) intramuscular in the right arm on 18Mar2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA) solution for injection, subcutaneously, from an unspecified date at an unspecified dose and frequency for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Medical history included polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), RA, hypothyroidism, anemia. The patient had no known allergies. It was unknown if the patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included prednisone, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), folic acid, calcium carbonate (CAL). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of BNT162B2. On 18Mar2021 (within 4 hours of the vaccination), the patient experienced a rheumatoid arthritis flare up. The clinical course was as follows: on 18Mar2021 at 15:00, the patient experienced pain in elbow and finger pain (like trigger finger of both hands). On Mar2021 (within 24 hours), all fingers were involved, the patient&#39;s grip strength was decreased (she could not make a fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands) and experienced left wrist pain. On Mar2021 (within 48 hours), the patient experienced finger edema, was still unable to make fist or grasp, experienced painful shooting pains up inner arms, right ear &amp; head pains. The patient increased the prednisone dose to 4 mg daily as treatment for the events. On 21Mar2021 at 11:00 (72 hours after vaccination), the patient continued to experience bilateral arm pains, slight hand grips but could not lift, new right knee and right outer foot pains. On 21Mar2021 (94 hours after vaccination), there was less arm pain and finger edema, continued right ear/head pains. The patient saw the primary physician, there was no ear infection and the physician agreed with the prednisone increase. The physician felt the patient should not take the second vaccine dose and alerted the rheumatologist. On 22Mar2021 (116 hours after vaccination), the patient was able to lift and grasp with both hands, had less ear and arm pain. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The action taken with adalimumab in response to the events was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events trigger finger, inability to grip or grasp with her hands, severe flare of RA symptoms 4 hours post vaccine, pain in arms and elbows, pain in ears was not provided. The clinical outcome of rheumatoid arthritis flare up, trigger finger, &#34;grip strength decreased/could not make fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands&#34;, pain in arm, right ear &amp; head pains was resolving; while of pain in elbow was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the RA flare and other events.  The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                I developed a headache, burning of my face and upper gums   45-60 minutes after the vaccine. As the day went on I developed slight swelling of my upper lip.  The burning of my face lasted until the following day but then would come and go.  The swelling of my upper lips lasted  4 days.  Last Thursday 1/7/2021 my face was burning and lasted the day.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

Could not report symptoms but if had been asked directly could have. REalised half way driving home that I should not be driving. Eurphoria lasted for 24 hours. Was on phone constantly the next day for 7 hours straight without eating.  Could not remember what some items were like a drone. Had to ask = that thing that flies with a camera. Short term memory loss that continues. Facial numbness began 48 hours after injection. Facial numbness continues changing in areas of right side of my face. Felt extremely vulnerable. Wore my same clothing for 4 days as I did not remember that I had clean clothing. Did not remember that I should notify medical personal until late 2/20.

A 64-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER2613, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 1900 wherein blood pressure was high prior to her atrial fibrillation medications; A fib (atrial fibrillation) from 2016 and ongoing; and ongoing heartrate low. As a child the caller had the vaccine in the sugar cube (unspecified) and her mouth was swelling from it; and stated that patient&#39;s sister was hospitalized after receiving the same vaccine. Family medical history included mom has hypertension. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day; sotalol taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 80 mg, twice a day; and diltiazem taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 180 mg, once a day.  The patient was a healthcare worker and she has had friends who have died from covid. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient stated she had the first dose of the vaccine and had a TIA (Apr2021) and rupture of a blood vessel in her eye 20Mar2021. The TIA was on Monday (Apr2021) and she was supposed to have her second dose tomorrow (09Apr2021). She stated she may get it but she is not taking it tomorrow because she is still having residual symptoms. She asked what the length of time she can wait to get it before she has to restart. Patient reported that after she got her first vaccine she had a ruptured blood vessel in her eye the next day (20Mar2021). She put warm and cool compresses on her eye then the ruptured blood vessel subsided. The ruptured blood vessel came back again a few days later and this time it was the entire sclera. She developed blood clots in her eye and the doctor said it probably wasn&#39;t from the vaccine (Mar2021). She was supposed to get her second dose of the vaccine tomorrow 09Apr2021 but she was going to hold off for now. She then had a TIA (Mar2021) and became hospitalized because of it from 06Apr2021 to 07Apr2021. The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation but has been taking her medication religiously. She believed that the TIA was from the vaccine as there was no explanation as to why it happened. Her heart rate was low anyways from the medications (dates unspecified) but it dropped to 35 when she was in the hospital (Apr2021). The patient&#39;s primary care provide was not the attending in the hospital when the caller was hospitalized. Furthermore, it was reported that on 21Mar2021, patient&#39;s eye was super red but only on one side of her left eye.

Then that Friday, 25Mar2021, the patient&#39;s sclera looked like her eye was bleeding and her pupil started turning a different color.  Then last Monday (Apr2021), the patient woke up and her right arm, the right side of her face, and her right knee were numb she got up and went to see if she had a facial droop and did not. The patient thought it was from her sleeping wrong, but these symptoms did not go away. The patient went to the Emergency Room where they did a CT of her head and neck, with and without contrast which was negative. The patient was admitted on 06Apr2021 to the observation unit where they did an MRI and ECHO, which were both negative and she was diagnosed with a TIA and possible pinched nerve (Apr2021). The patient denied any heavy lifting prior to this event other than normal day to day things. The patient was discharged on Wednesday 07Apr2021. The patient&#39;s face felt like its burning, she has numbness in her right finger and right thumb. Physical therapy and occupational therapy said the patient should be okay but to be careful with things that were hot because she was at risk of burning herself. The second time the patient&#39;s eye became red, her vision was kind of blurry (Apr2021) and she didn&#39;t know if the blood was in her pupil. The only deficit that the patient has now is sensational loss in her right hand (Apr2021) and that should improve per the occupational therapist at the hospital. The caller was supposed to get the second dose of the vaccine on 09Apr2021 but she doesn&#39;t want to take it while she is having these symptoms. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient included: head ct with and without contrast: negative on 06Apr2021; MRI brain: negative on 06Apr2021; Echocardiogram: negative on 07Apr2021; speech evaluation: passed on 07Apr2021.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 16Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose as the patient is a counselor, essential worker, in the health field but she got in because of age (COVID-19 immunization). Medical history included Subclinical hypothyroid (she takes no meds. Was diagnosed 10 years ago), allergies to Sulfa drug, seasonal allergies and sprained wrist. A couple antibiotics bother her stomach but she was not allergic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included estradiol, B12, calcium and glucosamine. Other medications included estrogen, vitamins, glucosamine supplements, and takes a cream for injury: sprained wrist, she doesn&#39;t know the name of it, it is an anti-inflammatory cream, she doesn&#39;t think any of that will do anything. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had the vaccine on 16Jan2021 Saturday and within 15 minutes (also reported as 20 minutes after shot and at 12:00), the patient experienced severe ringing in ears. She had severe ringing in her ears, it was really loud, and was still there. She can&#39;t seem to figure out if it was normal, what&#39;s causing it and could it be from the vaccine. It may have been anxiety because of that, but right after she heard ringing, there was a lump feeling in her throat on same day, like something was in her throat, she thought she had throat swelling, it lasted a couple of days, but she had no shortness of breath or anything. Ringing in ears was a lot worse in the morning, and gets better during the day, maybe because she was around noise, but it comes and goes, there are two separate sounds, one was a high pitched and continuous, the other one was lower pitched, a little fragmented, if she drew a picture, there would be little dust particles in the air, but the other is constant, she tried really hard to ignore, but it was driving her nuts. She is hoping it will go away. The lump feeling in her throat was gone, she was wondering if it was anxiety. It was mentioned, &#34;She gets nervous, gets a lump in her throat a lot&#34;, but this was really severe, but she saw a man being taken away in an ambulance, and that scared her, she was waiting in the waiting area, and saw that, so it scared her. Recovered completely from the lump feeling in her throat. Throat was normal in 2 days but ears ringing still there after 4 days. There was no treatment for the events severe ringing in ears and Lump feeling in throat. The outcome of the events severe ringing in ears was not recovered; event Lump feeling in throat and throat swelling was recovered in 18Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other event.

Very gradually, that got worse (over the nest few hours) and I had tingling of hands and feet.  I gradually developed facial swelling (my lips were enlarged and felt firm, as did my nose).  I checked my pulse ox, and it remained above 97%.  I never had rash or trouble breathing.  But  about 5 hours after receiving the immunization, I took some Benadryl, and over about 1/2 hour I could feel that things were improving.  Over the next 24 hours I took Benadryl again two times, due to return of the tingling sensation of my lips.  I also felt very cold, and had a hard time getting warm.  This also improved with the Benadryl.

THEN FELT A SENSATION IN MY CHEST AROUND BOTH LUNG AREAS WHICH TRAVELED UP MY NECK.  I SAT DEBATING WITH MYSELF WHETHER TO MAKE A SCENE AND CALL FOR HELP VERSUS TELLING MYSELF IT WOULD BE OKAY.  IT TOOK ABOUT 7 MINUTES BEFORE I COULD RELAX AND NOT BE TERRIFIED OF WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED TO ME.  I NOTICED A SCRATCHY SENSATION ON THE BACK OF MY TONGUE.  GLAD HUSBAND WAS DRIVING BECAUSE I WAS SLIGHTLY DIZZY FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  IT WAS TERRIFYING AND I DO NOT WANT TO GET INJECTION #2.

Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the shot (Covid vaccine, Pfizer) a couple of days ago and I experienced the weird side effects. I just wanted to know if that was normal things or if I need to report this? I had a metallic taste in base of my throat and after that I have like burning in my throat. I had another question before you change. I was reading the pamphlets that was given to me at the clinic and it says that it is been in clinic trial an approximately 20,000 individuals have received the vaccine is that all? I had the vaccine on 21Jan2021 and it started immediately afterwards. No, it went away on following day.&#34; No treatment received. The outcome of the event was recovered in Jan2021.

                                                On February 11, 2 days after my vaccination, I woke up with pain and swelling under my left eye.  Over the next 2 days, the left side of my face under the eye experienced redness and swelling then subsided and localized into a large stye on the lower left eyelid.  Now,  a week later, the stye is still red and pus filled but has improved and is slowly resolving.   I would not normally think that this affliction had anything to do with getting a vaccine but it does seem strange that something like this could occur in someone who is very healthy and and does not experience any side effects from vaccines.   The last time I had a stye was in my 20&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as the one I am now experiencing.   Since the Covid vaccine is so new and however unrelated this coincidental affliction seems, I thought I should report it regardless.

So she gave herself Sudafed because she was thinking it was normal allergies. By 06Feb2021, it wasn&#39;t better. The Sudafed did not seem to help. She went to the Urgent care on 06Feb2021, who told her to go to ENT. She has an ENT appointment on 09Feb2021. The Urgent care prescribed her a short dose of prednisone by mouth 10mg twice a day. She has looked, and not find loss of hearing as a side effect. She hasn&#39;t called the doctor yet. The hearing loss has persisted or worsened. It is not constant all day long, but it is there all day long. As of on 09Feb2021, it was pretty bad. On 04Feb2021 she was also experiencing ear ringing. It was a high pitched ring in the same ear. She had tinnitus in both ears, but it was usually low. This one since the pressure started building in her ear, the ringing was louder and bigger. The ringing was worsening. The outcome of events was not recovered.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: 150 systolic on 29Jan2021 (usually 107-110/79).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of stroke.

                                                Six days after receiving my second vaccine at a mass drive-thru site (on 2/25), I experienced plugged ears -- a feeling of congestion, pressure and mild pain. Then three days after that, on 2/28, I became dizzy and nauseous, causing vomiting and a feeling that I may faint. My husband took me to Urgent Care where I was diagnoses with BPPV and prescribed meclizine and ondansetron. I have been doing the Epley maneuver and my condition has improved somewhat, but I still feel fatigued and the pressure in my ears has not subsided. I cannot hear correctly out of my left ear. I am concerned that I now have Meniere&#39;s disease, which can be caused by &#34;abnormal immune response&#34; -- the vaccine? I have an appointment with an ENT specialist on 3/25 and hopefully can get some answers at that time.

Medical history included, in the 1990&#39;s, was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (limited, used to be called CREST scleroderma), pretty severe Raynaud&#39;s syndrome, telangiectases, fatigue and sometimes joint aches.

I have had so many different symptoms and some have gone away like my fever is gone but I have such a painful headache that I can&#39;t eat, nausea and constant diarrhea, you get the idea. I&#39;m not against the vaccine but I think it would be good if people like me, people that have had my experience know, I hope it&#39;s within the normal range, I still don&#39;t know I would love to talk to somebody and find out if what I am experiencing is in the normal range, but it&#39;s not, people saying they experience so far the kind of the level of being in bed, low energy, unable to eat, fever, headache, stomach upset, I didn&#39;t have a cold, I had respiratory, I had a cough that has cleared up. I was hospitalized yesterday with fluids to become hydrated. It&#39;s important for us, you know, I mean, I leave the work that not good, people need to be prepared, it should be sick time I think it&#39;s important there is a follow up, absolutely. I was very happy I got the vaccine but I am so sick and it&#39;s been a week today so, that&#39;s why I decided to call and I was in the hospital yesterday, getting fluids dehydrated and I was admitted (reason for hospitalization was not clarified). I wasn&#39;t admitted, I was in the hospital for the day on IV fluids, anti-nausea medication, pain medication also, 3 things they gave me in an IV. They sent me home but the diarrhea I have so bad, I&#39;m exhausted, but I have to spent all my time in the toilet, I thought today might be, I might wake up it would be healing today but I&#39;m still pretty sick.&#34; Outcome of fever and cough was recovered, and of remaining events was not recovered. The patient underwent COVID-19 virus test via nasal swab on 03Mar2021 with negative result.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half.

The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her.

The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life.

                                                Within 5 min of injection: front 3rd top of tongue started getting numb and I got a metallic taste in mouth. That dissipated fairly quickly. Mostly gone within 30 min. Went home. Left side of Parotid started swelling - at 12/24/2020 in the morning. I didn&#39;t notice anything wrong until I tried to eat breakfast. Very painful. Swelled up very large. Couldnt&#39; eat much for four days when I finally saw my dr (28th). and he gave  a prescription: an antibiotic and that started helping. When I  salivated it would start to swell. Pain was worse the first day and I massaged it alot to force saliva out of the grand. Tried to eat for very bland and very little on one side of mouth. Augmentin  Amox-Clad 875 mg. was the antibiotic I was given and that took about 24 hours to help.

A 66-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Illness at vaccine included urinary tract infection from Jan2021 and ongoing. Medical history included face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection from 04Jan2021 to 11Jan2021. The patient had historically gotten shingles vaccine, flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine and never had any problems. The patient experienced swelling in face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019) and right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed on 10Jan2020 17:00. This consumer had the bnt162b2 on 10Jan2021 at about 12:30pm. On 10Jan2021 around 4:00 pm (reported as &#34;10Jan2020 05:00 pm&#34;) she noticed the areas around her temples and under eyes where she had filler placed last year swelled up quite a bit. She read up on this and saw to take antihistamines or oral steroids for this, so she took antihistamines and the event improved, was much better through during the day yesterday (11Jan2021). Last night (11Jan2021) her right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; in response to that event she has been icing the area and the event has improved, swelling come down quite a bit but still ongoing. She called her primary care physician about this event and is waiting for a callback from them about getting a steroid pack. She already reported this information on an unknown Pfizer website online, and also on the VAERS reporting online site today (12Jan2021); but does not have any reference numbers from those reports to provide at this time. She called to ask for information on how to proceed regarding this event; if this has been reported with bnt162b2; if there would be problems with her getting the second dose of bnt162b2 as scheduled on 31Jan2021 because she heard the second dose would be worse. She also noted during this report that she was still taking nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection when she received that first dose of bnt162b2; she asked if that could have any correlation with event or be a problem taken together. She reported by the time she got that first dose the urinary tract infection itself was gone. Caller verified that she received no other vaccines on the date of first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she had not received any other vaccines in the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she has no history of any adverse events with any other vaccines. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I took 2 Benedryl tablets and experienced symptoms for the next hour. They subsided by 5:30 pm . I was able to breathe and swallow during the whole episode. I had very similar reactions several times in June when I was for unknown reasons experiencing hives and had same response when prescribed Bactrim, and then Keflex because of a UTI. I had no further incidents with the chest, throat, mouth reaction since mid June until yesterday.  I had no adverse reaction to the vaccine until 3.5 hrs after receiving it. I feel this is because my body has some sensitivity, not that anything was done incorrectly in administration of the vaccine. All personnel were very attentive and careful that I observed.

It was difficult to swallow, but not difficult to breathe.  I took 25 mg of Benadryl and 4 hours later took 50 mg of Benadryl.  The swelling did not diminish, but did not get worse.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Cholesterol and Blood pressure, patient stated she took low dose medication for her blood cholesterol and blood pressure, but has had no new medications. She had a history of some allergies: a slight shrimp and scallops allergy, possible peanuts, penicillin, and a Neomycin product. She said they were not a big deal, and she had environmental allergies as well. She had an allergic reaction to the eye drop Neomycin, possibly, just the eye drop, she had a little breakout around her lips but she didn&#39;t know if it was the drug or not. The allergy to shrimp and scallops showed up in a blood test, her reaction to peanuts around her mouth but she had a negative scratch test and blood test for allergy to peanuts. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient stated she did get the flu vaccine, that was ok, she was fine, this was probably around Nov2020 or so, though she didn&#39;t know off hand when she got it, it was the regular flu vaccine and not an increased dose. The patient experienced arm discomfort on 17Jan2021, itching to eyes, mouth, and throat an hour after vaccination on 17Jan2021 12:00. The patient took the first shot yesterday (17Jan2021) and she had some discomfort to her arm, but it didn&#39;t bother her. She got the shot about 11:00 yesterday (17Jan2021) and about an hour after the shot she had some itching to her eyes, mouth, and throat that was not severe then was on and off through the day. She would like to know if this is common, she would like the information for the second dose, if she should expect more or less or same, she was concerned about the second dose. She did not have a severe reaction, she just wanted to make sure there weren&#39;t any adverse reaction for that make sure she known. She had not seen a doctor for her itching eyes, mouth, and throat. She didn&#39;t do any treatment for it, it was better today (18Jan2021), she just noticed it an hour after the injection that she felt a bit of eyes being itchy and all over, her mouth and throat were not severe, but she definitely felt it through the day. She felt it a little at night sometimes anyway like a dry throat. It was gone this morning and her arm was better, it seemed like the itching went with the arm things since following her arm soreness her itchiness started, then when her arm felt better the itchy was going away. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

She states it has not improved nor worsened over the course of the day.  She still has strength in her left upper extremity.  She states that within the first hour or 2 after injection and she noted some perioral numbness.  She states that her lips were tingling and then she noted on her cheeks and then down the sides of her neck.  She states she never had any difficulty swallowing or difficulty breathing.

I have had up 7 more since then and after my 2nd vaccine.  Dr. thought it might be related since I have no history of chronic migraines.  All past were over 16 years ago and related to hormonal changes.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021. She called her doctor on Monday and was seen by her doctor on Tuesday, 09Feb2021. The patient was referred to the eye center. Her headache was getting a little better. On 10Feb2021, the patient was seen at an institution, her retina and macula looked good, so she was referred to the ED. The patient was told she probably had a stroke. The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown. The has trouble reading now since the stroke.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to the vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent or underlying medical conditions in this elderly patient with excessive weight (BMI=29) and underlying elevated cholesterol.

                                                On my way home from receiving the vaccine, I felt slight numbness in my lips (no further swelling, etc.).  Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose in her left arm for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no investigation assessment. It was reported that it had been 24 hours, she received her first bnt162b2 (reported as Pfizer COVID vaccine), yesterday (on 06Jan2021), and she was wondering, her arm was sore on 07Jan2021, which she thought was normal and fatigue on 06Jan2021, she got right away, she didn&#39;t know if that was normal, but she got a metallic taste in her mouth on 06Jan2021. It felt like a metallic taste when she swallows, a little metallic taste, yesterday (on 06Jan2021) was more than today, it was after the vaccine, about 7 hours after. She thought in her head, like the aluminum chewing gum, when kids chew it, it had a metallic taste, like the (company name withheld) wrapper she used to chew on it. Provides she was shrinking. Provide she was wearing stretch pants when providing weight. She Googled and didn&#39;t see the metallic taste, the only thing she saw with metallic taste is if you have the actual virus, she didn&#39;t have it, she was fine. Maybe it was all in her head. Arm was sore not right away, it built up, like when you stretch like with the flu shot, she lifted and it&#39;s sore, and she felt sleepy. It was like with the flu shot, it took a few days to go away. Last night on 06Jan2021, she was very sleepy, she was kind of sleepy, but it could be watching the Capitol and insanity, but she was yawning a lot more, her eyes felt heavy, she was ok, she had an appetite and is fine, she would drink (company name withheld) now. Thought she was peaking with it, she would go to sleep early today (07Jan2021), her eyes were still heavy, she wanted to close them and took a nap, but couldn&#39;t. It was like her saliva has a metallic taste in her mouth, it may be in her head, she googled to see side effects and when they start, it may be going soon, who knows, she was just wondering. The taste was worse yesterday (06Jan2021), and it wasn&#39;t IV or anything like that, the patient wanted to know how can that be. She had to go back on the 27th for her second dose. She had been tested and retested on an unspecified date, and it was offered for those 65 and over, and she was lucky to get an appointment. The outcome of the event metallic taste was recovering; the events fatigue and eyes heavy was not recovered; the outcome of the rest events was unknown.

                                                An hour after the vaccine, my lower lip started swelling and feeling puffy. It got worse and the inside of my mouth started feeling more puffy and full. I called my doctor. He directed to go to the Emergency Department right away. Since I&#39;m allergic to Benadryl, my doctor wanted to make sure I&#39;d be OK. I was treated with 40 mg of oral Prednisone and given a prescription to continue taking 20 mg daily for the next 3 days. The Emergency Department doctor recommended that I do not take the 2nd dose, but I wondered if I was on Prednisone the day of the next shot if I&#39;d be safer? The ER doctor thinks the next reaction of a swelling lip/mouth could be more intense after the 2nd dose. I will follow up with my internist. I&#39;ve had a mild swelling of my lip a few times in my life after eating something with artificial preservatives.

I&#39;ve never had any adverse reaction to a vaccine or other medication ... although I tend to be medication sensitive so I avoid it if possible. My only allergies are seasonal/pollen (outdoor) and some indoor (mold, etc.) What was my reaction? Can I take the 2nd dose or not?

                                                January 8th, I experienced flu like symptoms (aching, tiredness) which I understand this is normal. These symptoms lasted only aprox. four hours.  The other reaction, the one I am concerned about is that my bottom lip began to swell. The swelling continued throughout the night, swelling 3x normal size. It began to recede back to normal within 48 hours. Also, my lymph nodes under my right arm ( the injection arm) was very sore for 48 hours as well.

                                                Blurred vision, benign vertigo, immediately after vaccine given.  Corrected itself over the next hour. But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

This 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 09:55 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient got her first injection of the COVID-19 vaccine on 26Jan2021 at 09:55AM in her left arm. Patient said that the diarrhea just started on 26Jan2021, she had tried calling earlier and had to hang up because of it, maybe because she was nervous. Patient said that she tasted the vaccine constantly, she has been experiencing a bad taste in her mouth, she couldn&#39;t stand the taste. Patient couldn&#39;t get rid of the taste. She said beforehand she was scared of anaphylactic shock, but she was having the taste in her mouth and diarrhea. She said she had the taste of the vaccine in her mouth and throat on 26Jan2021. She said that everything that she eats she is trying to get taste out of her throat. Patient has done no treatment yet for the diarrhea or the taste in her mouth. She said that her arm didn&#39;t hurt afterwards and she didn&#39;t feel the shot, and now she can&#39;t touch her arm without it hurting though she has been moving her arm a lot. She said she knew that from the flu shot, but that never hurt her, this thing was sore (sore arm) on 26Jan2021. She said she wasn&#39;t worried about that though, she just wanted to know if the taste would go away, and if it was normal. She said that there was nothing that said anything about diarrhea either, and she was not sick, she didn&#39;t feel sick, there was just the taste. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Then I started to have tightness in my chest and used my albuterol inhaler.   I was still having symptoms an hour later so took Benadryl 25 mg.  During the night I woke up with mild wheezing and used my inhaler again.  Throughout the next 2 days, I continued to have these symptoms (except for wheezing) off and on.  Today, I still have some symptoms but not as often or severe.

                                                Immediately after medicine went in my arm I felt a warm flush from my neck all the way to my toes (the same as when I have had radioactive dye),    during my 15 minutes of observation my hands and feet were cold and sweaty and I felt a little shaky.  I waited 20 minutes and went to the restroom and had diarrhea (very rare for me).  I went to my car and looked in the mirror and my face was bright red and  the whites of my eyes were red and my eyes were glassy.  I went back in to the observation area and was given oral Benadryl. and monitored for 45 minutes.  Right after I took the Benadryl my throat felt itchy (not sore - itchy).  My blood pressure was 157/62 when I first sat down but came down to 130/ 60 by the time I was sent home.  My bp is normally about 106/60.   I was really tired at home for the rest of the day so went to be early.  The next day I felt fine and my arm was only slightly sore.  The doctor at the immunization clinic told me not to get the 2nd shot.  I called my GP,  and he too told me not to get the 2nd COVID shot and wait until more information has come out about adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did not have any difficulty breathing.  I don &#39;t know if the redness on my face went down my neck to my chest.  I didn&#39;t look.  I did not have a fever.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

She immediately began noticing that the words on her TV screen were not legible - her vision had become blurry. This blurriness was accompanied by severe eye pain and pain in the temples of her head. When shutting eyes and keeping them closed for a few hours, the blurriness would subside. However she continues to experience this blurriness &#39;on and off&#39; to date. Also experienced some mild headaches but they have subsided as of two days ago. Hasn&#39;t taken anything to alleviate the symptoms. Patient is extremely concerned that she may permanently lose vision and refuses to get 2nd dose.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren&#39;t like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn&#39;t have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn&#39;t know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn&#39;t feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can&#39;t since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn&#39;t normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn&#39;t believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn&#39;t wake up with this eye shut. It wasn&#39;t pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn&#39;t feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don&#39;t really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn&#39;t have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can&#39;t the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn&#39;t really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided. She noticed that it comes and goes and sometimes she can eat and she is fine and sometimes she gets really sick feeling. It seems like if she doesn&#39;t eat then she doesn&#39;t get the symptoms but she knows that she needs to eat. Investigations: Her doctor has been having her do platelet blood tests about every 5 days since she took the COVID vaccine. She does not remember the dates of these tests off of the top of her head. She had a blood draw at the clinic the day before her COVID vaccine and her platelet count was 49 on 08Mar2021. For the result of 29 that was either last Thursday or last Friday, 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021. Te outcome of the event scleral discoloration was recovered on 13Mar2021, tiredness was recovered on 15Mar2021, headache was not recovered, pain in hip was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021299104 similar report from same reporter

The patient was not pregnant, was not pregnant at time of vaccination. No COVID tested post vaccination. On 15Feb2021, within a few days of receiving second dose of vaccine, the patient developed blurry vision of right eye. After seeing a retina specialist, patient was diagnosed with BRVO (retinal vein branch occlusion). The cause of BRVO is a localized clot (thrombus) development in a branch retinal vein. The events resulted in disability or permanent damage. The patient received treatment as anti-VEGF drug - Avastin for the events. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

Reported as: Caller states that on 04Feb2021 she received her 2nd vaccine at around 3:30 pm, and then around 10 pm she had injection site soreness. The morning after the second injection around 4 am, she had site on her arm soreness, erratic body temperature with slight fever, horrible headache, bodyaches, and dry heaves. Her lymph nodes also swelled up again.  Caller clarifies that this also happened after her first injection of the Pfizer Covid19 vaccine and on a similar timeline. Caller clarifies that 2 weeks later on 26Feb2021 she had ended up with horrible headache, dry heaves, headache, body temperature 104.4. She states that this lasted Friday night and Saturday night and Sunday she was feeling better. Clarifies that was the week of 26Feb2021. Caller states that her events were on a similar timeline and that her first vaccine was 14Jan2021 at 3:30 pm on Thursday. States that by 10 o&#39;clock that night, injection site was sore.  At 4 am, injection site was very sore. A couple of days later, her lymph nodes were swollen in her left leg, groin area, right arm under armpit. Adds that area under armpit was the size of her thumb. Also, on the left underneath her chest wall.  She states that she has had breast cancer in that left breast. She states that the swelling went away completely, but that the groin area swelling took 2 weeks to go away. Unable to verbalize exact dates. Confirms that this was after the first vaccine and also occurred after the second vaccine. Caller then adds that she was feeling better Sunday, 28Feb2021 but that her husband then found her on the floor Sunday night at 8:45 pm. She states that she passed out.

Caller clarifies that she was admitted to (Hospital Name) on 01Mar2021. Caller adds that she went to the hospital 2 weeks after the second dose. She states that is what makes them wonder if it is from the Covid vaccine. Adds that she is not saying that is what caused all of this, but that it is just a coincidence that it was exactly 2 weeks after the vaccine, exactly 2 weeks out when this happened. She states that she has been thinking if she should be wasting Pfizers time reporting this but it could be a coincidence or maybe a reaction.  Caller adds maybe it is because she had 34 radiations, 8 chemo treatments, 1 year of Herceptine, and breast cancer.  States that maybe she can save somebody else, or if a possibility, people can be prepared two weeks early.  She adds that she is lucky she did not break an arm, leg. or bone.

It was there for a couple of days and then it would just remind her it was there.  The arm lymph node swelling went away after a few days, maybe before a week or so. The one in the groin was there for about two weeks. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 1.5 and was not something that people need to take an Advil or something for. Clarifies it was in the armpit except in the left side because they took those lymph nodes out during surgery in 2008.  Also, she noticed lymph node swelling in the chest area.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

The biggest problem was that my eyes became strangely affected, like there were shutters being opened and closed in rhythmic waves inside my eyes. They were also very photosensitive and blurry. My whole head felt wrong. drove me home, (I could not have driven).  This lasted several hours. I had chills and stayed laying down with my eyes closed. By the end of the day I felt mostly recovered.  This series of events recurred 6 days later,  on Jan. 20th. This time it also lasted most of the day, but I continued feeling moderately unwell the next day, and today it continues. I feel weak and unsteady. My eyes are better but  not entirely. They ache and feel insecure. I am not currently feeling up to any activities besides resting.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

Reaction description by the reporter:&#34; I had no pain, slight headache. My blood pressure now is 137/93. It was high this morning when I talked with the triage nurse. I had the shot/vaccine (first dose) on Friday. I feel better today than yesterday. Friday I felt fine. I got symptoms yesterday. When I woke up yesterday. I was feeling a little woozy, I always stretch slowly in bed. I slowly raised myself on the bed but before I got up my torso fell backwards. I felt like I was fainting. The room was spinning. All day yesterday I did not drive. I walked very slowly. I was holding onto the wall. I felt lousy like I had the flu. I would lay down for 20 minutes, watching tv. My head was sideways and every time I would raise my head the room was spinning. Also there is not enough spit in my mouth. It is very dry. I had a slight headache. So I did not bother but no headache today. I supposed to get my 2nd dose on 02Feb2021. The action taken was not applicable. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

This 68-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unknown route, on 14Jan2021 (at 08:30) at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included orthostatic intolerance, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant concomitant medications included hydrocortisone (CORTEF), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), fludrocortisone acetate (FLUDROCORTISON) and pyridostigmine. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. On 14Jan2021, after vaccination, she began to feel unsteady, weak, lightheaded, chest tight, and dizzy. Her eyed began swimming with a sensation of shutters being opened and closed in front of her. She could not see very well, eyes were very photosensitive. Layed down and slept, rested in a dark room most of the day. She had also chills and headache. But nightfall she felt mostly recovered, although not very energetic. About one week later, on 20Jan2021, it all happened again, all at once. She also rested for the day and slowly recovered. But this time it hasn&#39;t all gone away. She is still weak, fuzzy, unsteady, fatigued, she had headache, and &#39;my eyes are not right&#39; (as reported). Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed.

Saw opthmologist prescribed Acyclovir.  Over a couple days swelling dissapeared and burning, itching subsided.  The thing is, I had my second COVID dose on 02/10/2021,  10:00AM Pitzer Lot #9581.  On 02/18/2021 late evening, started to feel burning in left eye nose area again, next morning eye swollen shut.  Saw Dr, said I was having an allergic reaction and put me on prednesone and Amoxicylin.  No reduction of swelling and burning, blisters were forming.  Went to Urgent Care on 2/20/2021 and was prescribed Acyclovir again.  Swelling now gone and itching burning diminished.

A 68-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on her left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (Diagnosed 3 to 4 years ago) and thyroid disorder. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine on Saturday and went home and fell asleep, woke up and had lumps in back of neck, they hurt, pain goes around into jaw, up into the face and ear hurts. The patient just tried a hot compress, a hot cloth on there, it seemed to help a little bit for a while. Took some Advil and that helped a little bit, but when it wears off it comes back. Adds she felt dizzy too, and still felt like that too, it started right after she got it, and it comes and goes. The outcome of the event dizzy was unknown while not recovered for the remaining events.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

She was trying to focus on a sign we had in the waiting room, and the words started blurring and doubling. BP was normal, heart rate was slightly elevated. With time (about 10 minutes), patient reported it was improving. We got patient to her feet first to ensure balance wasn?t effected and then patient reported she was ok to leave.

Treated in an ambulance at vaccine site with IV Benadryl, had some skin tingling, also given IV solumedrol and observed for almost 2 hours with no other symptoms. I was also hypertensive, probably due to anxiety.

Also, around the same time, I developed a metallic taste in mouth that resolved quickly after drinking warm coffee. The lip/tongue issue was not concerning and resolved within an hour.  I do suffer from anxiety having experienced reactions to food and medicines although never anything severe.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 58-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included aspirin (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]) taken daily. The patient experienced light headedness and pressure in her chest that went to her left shoulder and jaw. Patient had light headache, pain in chest, and pain in jaw. She woke up this morning feeling better but still had slight pain in jaw. Wondering if side effects are from vaccine and will she be ok. Patient stated, &#34;I have the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021, I didn&#39;t have any side effect, my arm was sore but nothing big. But yesterday I feel light headed, like pressure in my chest, kind of pressure on my jaw and shoulder, my left shoulder, and my vitals were okay like my blood pressure, my heart rate and everything was normal. Further she explained this morning I felt better I didn&#39;t have pressure on my chest or anything but the pressure on my jaw that go up to my head. Is that related to the vaccine or is something that I have to worry about?&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;The second one is going to be on 12Feb2021, this Friday.&#34; Patient stated, &#34;No, I was calling because today I feel better, I don&#39;t have the pressure on my chest. But I still have the pressure on my jaw and on my kind of my head. But no I have not called anybody. It&#39;s not like an emergency, I am calling because I was not sure about this is related to the vaccine.&#34; For treatment consumer stated, &#34;No, today I took some Tylenol, that&#39;s all.&#34; No investigation assessment.

For two days, unable to eat anything but broth and oatmeal.  After the second dose on 3/9/21, similarly, after 6-7 days same symptoms, however, to date, they have not subsided.  Food and liquids (even water and fizzy water) tastes funny, flat.  The smell of most food is nauseating, and in the last few days I have had some explosive diarrhea, now just loose stools.  For the last 3 days have felt dizzy; not constantly, but if I move my head quickly or bend over.  I did not have covid at the time of vaccination; I have had 8 covid tests in 2021 due to medical procedures and flying.

The day following the vaccination, wife began to suffer mild, common vaccination symptoms such as fatigue, hills, and joint pain.  In the days following, in addition to those symptoms, she began to cough and had a sore throat.  By March 8th, she had lost her sense of taste and sense of smell. We realized we needed to have her tested for COVID-19. We went to a testing area. She was seen and tested. She tested positive for COVID-19 (as did I).  The belief was that our illness was uncomplicated and we were sent home with instructions to monitor our symptoms.  On 03/14/2021, I took her to the hospital because her condition was worsening.

                                                her MS symptoms exploded; head became foggy; blurred eyes; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report by contactable consumer(patient) from Pfizer Sponsored program.  A 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 17Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for 20 years and autoimmune disease. Concomitant medications included interferon beta-1a (AVONEX) for MS. The patient previously took Avelox for MS. Caller also states she would like to report that she has a history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and she goes to the clinic. Caller states since no studies were done on people with MS, she would like to report her experience. Caller states she received her first dose of the vaccine on 17Mar2021 and hours afterwards her MS symptoms exploded. Caller states she has had MS for 20 years and she doesn&#39;t even realize she has it because she is able to walk the dogs at the pound and she does 3600 steps a day and it doesn&#39;t keep her from doing anything. Caller states after the shot she has torn meniscus in her knees and her knees were so tight and she has heel spurs, and they were burning and hurt. Caller states she hurt her hand previously and her hand was tight, and it felt like it was going to explode. Caller states every injury she has ever had it felt like it was exacerbated and got worse. Caller states she was instructed by the Clinic to take Tylenol every 6 hours and these symptoms lasted for 12 days. Caller states she takes a medication called Avelox for MS once a week and she didn&#39;t take it after the shot because it is known to cause flu like symptoms, but she is back taking it now. Caller states she was working on the computer and her head became foggy and this lasted for six or seven days. The caller has MS and is on Avonex, it&#39;s a beta 1 interferon injectable that she has been taking for over 20 years. The caller&#39;s doctors told her it was okay to get the shot. Because of the caller&#39;s autoimmune disease, the caller&#39;s doctors don&#39;t know how effective the shot will be with an autoimmune disease. The caller has done well with Multiple Sclerosis; her Multiple Sclerosis was really good she was walking 3600 steps a day. The vaccine seems to have flared up everywhere the caller has been hurt. It made those spots worse. The caller had a torn meniscus and it felt like her knee was stiff like a board. The caller had a bone spur in her foot that it began to hurt where that was removed. The caller broke her left hand and then it felt like it was going to explode. The caller also had head fog and blurred eyes. It took 6-7 days for head fog to get better. The other symptoms it was 12-13 days to get better. The caller also had a slight headache. The clinic said there were no studies in someone with MS who took the covid vaccine, they only reported to them about the autoimmune disease. Someone on the thing said the second dose was 10 times worse than the first one. Then the caller was told if she gets those symptoms with the first shot then the second one will be better because your body is used to it and knows what to do. It is kind of like a trial by fire and no one knows what to expect. The caller wants to know if Pfizer had any information on Avonex interfering with MS. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Bitter, metal, tinny taste in mouth within one hour or less of vaccination. I am not sure of exact time because we ate directly after the fifteen minute waiting period. I didn&#39;t notice the sensation until right after we ate. It lasted about three days and then was gone. It was strong enough for me to notice immediately and think how weird, and it was strong enough for me to notice it off and on the next three days-gradually lessening. I have also had a sore throat the whole week since the vaccination-it started the day after. It hasn&#39;t turned into a cold-maybe a little drippy nose occasionally so not sure if sinuses etc, but the sore throat is persistent. Occasionally I feel it up higher in the nasal-pharynx also.  I didn&#39;t report to my doctor or treat in any way. And for statistics, my arm was sore for about two days. The worst was that evening and pretty mild after that.

Eyes started hurting with burning sensation, pressure in both ears and slight numbness across face from ear to ear and under nose.  Uncomfortable tightness in chest and a lot of pressure on face feeling like it was hot. I felt a little better after 15 minutes while waiting but never told anyone about symptoms. I walked out and drove home but monitored my symptoms.  The symptoms gradually became less and were gone after 1 hour and 45 minutes. I took a dose of benadryl at that time.  I slept well that night and woke up with no symptoms and none since.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient was recovering from the events of fever, blurred vision, and balance was off; not recovered from tired, jerking, and dehydration. Outcome of remaining events was unknown.

Historical vaccine includes Tetanus and experienced allergic reaction. Past drug includes Sulphur and experienced allergy. It was reported that the patient had the vaccine on 12Jan2021 and patient was working in long term care &#34;administrator&#34;. The patient did get a reaction and the patient hands swelled up about 20 minutes after the vaccine and her tongue swelled up. The patient did take Benadryl. The patient called her primary care doctor and was told to stay on the Benadryl and the patient was okay. The patient stated that the pharmacist that gave her the vaccine gave the Benadryl right away when the patient started swelling up.  The patient spoke to her allergist and stated that she cannot take the second dose vaccine. So, the patient was concerned about her coverage because she work in a long term case. The doctor would not give me the shingle vaccine (unspecified vaccine) because they were afraid the patient would have a reaction to that.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

She received her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 15:07 hrs. Due to her history of allergic reactions to multiple medications (including sulfa antibiotics and ceftriaxone), she was advised to extend her monitoring period to at least 30 minutes post-injection. At around 15:50 hrs I was notified that the patient was feeling a tingling sensation in her throat, itching, and a change in her voice. She was transferred to a stretcher for acute management of suspected anaphylaxis. Airway, breathing, circulation, and mentation were assessed immediately. EMS was called immediately via 911. Her vital signs were obtained, with a BP 168/90 mm/Hg, HR 105/min, RR 24/min. She reported shortness of breath at the time. There was no stridor or wheezing on exam. She appeared in mild respiratory distress. At 15:54 hrs she was given an intramuscular EpiPen injection (0.3 mg autoinjector) in her left thigh. At 15:58 she was given an intramuscular methylprednisolone injection (125 mg) in her right thigh. Immediately after that EMS team arrived and took over her care with plans to administer diphenhydramine intramuscularly, and will transfer to ED for further management. Throughout the event the patient remained awake, alert, and fully oriented.

I immediately took a Benadryl.  (I knew to do this because I had done this when I had an allergic reaction to penicillin years ago.   By about an hour later I felt alright and the redness on my neck had almost faded away.

                                                Patient experienced vertigo within 15 minutes of administration of COVID 19 shot.  Her blood pressure was 97/73.  Five minutes later it was 123/83 and a third reading approximately 15 minutes after the original was 120/81.  The patient slowly felt better and was able to walk to find her companion.  She had a headache and decided to go home and forgo grocery shopping.  The next day she came in person to report experiencing tinnitus and mild headache still.  I sat with patient until she felt good enough to walk and then walked with her per her request to help her find her friend.  After about an hour of slowly getting better, but not good enough to follow through with her grocery shopping plans.  She decided to go home with her friend and rest and come back tomorrow to grocery shop and report back with any further symptoms.  She was feeling better enough to grocery shop and she was reminded to please fill out form for reporting purposes.

The tingling continued to spread over the next 10 minutes to both sides of tongue, towards the back. After about 15 minutes, I started to feel some stiffness of my jaw and teeth.  About 45 minutes later, I took 25mg benadryl at home.  The tingling and stiffness lasted a total of about 2 hours.

                                                Within 10 seconds I began to feel that something was wrong.   A full body response of a swirling congestion, extreme weakness. very blurry vision and couldn&#39;t think straight.  I had trouble walking to recovery room, felt nauseous and weak and had a very fast heartrate.  I had to stay in private recovery room for 45 min.  I was still very ill and nervous at this point.   I left with a family member and asked to be driven to the nearby hospital emergency room.  For a precaution .  We parked across from ER entrance for another 1 hour till I slowly regained strength to 50% normalcy.  I went home afterwards and had to go to bed. I was unable to drive my own vehicle home.  Day 2, still feel weak, shaky and not normal.  I consider this a serious adverse reaction that did not receive medical intervention but will prevent me from getting the second Pfizer shot.  After 5 hours post injection I felt 60% normal .  Day 2, 70 per cent normal.   The vaccination facility was not able to do blood pressure monitoring ( which is a problem for anyone experiencing reactions.)  They said their protocol was to call 911/ambulance.   My blood pressure was checked by a certified PA with professional equipment at the 3 hour post injection time and the diastolic pressure was still below 50.  And heart rate above normal.  Still weak and nauseous.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Had my 2nd vaccine on Jan 7, 2021. My arm was sore when I went to bed that night. I woke at 5:15 AM feeling achy. I took my temp and it was 98.8F which is a temp for me since I run low, around 96.9F I got ready for work at the hospital and went in. around 0830 my temp was 99.5 and I was more achy and sore. I called Employee Health and they said to continue to monitor my temp and call back if it passes 100. Then around 3PM , my temp was 101.5F I remain very achy and have some occasional ear pain and a mild headache,

                                                Patient received COVID pfizer vaccine at 0801PM. Patient left after 20 minutes after observation. Patient was travelling with husband at the car when she experienced warm/hot cheeks, flushing and concerned with history of previous reaction. When patient arrived ( approximately 835pm), patient sat down on the chair. The redness started to extend to her neck and it was then decided to place the patient to the stretcher. Vitals signs were done in which the BP was 183/104 and 174/101 (845pm). The redness spreaded to her forehead and neck. Benadryl 50mg PO was then given (847pm). Patient BP was taken again which was 182/122 , pulse 80, RR 24 (855pm). Patient then complained about pressure in her throat, eyes (right eyes slightly swollen ) and face. It was then decided that epinephrine (859PM) be used but unfortunately the trainer box was removed so the epinephrine was not actually given. The BP documented was then 193/112 (0859PM). EMS  was then called as the epinephrine was administered per protocol. EMS arrived (0910 PM) and BP at that time was 230/112, pulse 70. Patient was started with heart monitor and IV. EMS then took her to the Emergency across the street with husband.

My daughter turned around and tried to get back to the park but there was a very long line, so I decided to wait and see what happened.  The pain subsided after a few minutes, and then the tip of my tongue just felt numb.  I do not know exactly for how long it was numb because I fell asleep when I got home after an hour drive from the site.  When I woke up it felt better, but the next day and up to today it feels as if the tip of my tongue was burnt with a hot liquid.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall.

Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH; Lot Number: EN6201) intramuscularly on 05Mar2021 (at the age of 70-years-old) as a single dose in the deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing HTN (hypertension; onset date: years ago; pertinent details: well controlled) from an unspecified date and menopause from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrochlorothiazide orally taken for HTN from an unspecified date, ongoing estradiol benzoate (ESTRADIOL) vaginal taken for menopause from an unspecified date and ongoing multivitamin orally taken for health maintenance from an unspecified date. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH; Lot Number: EL9261) intramuscularly on 12Feb2021 as a single dose in the deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced sore arms and should injury.

These were pretty strong. For 24 hours after onset they were pretty severe. Then she experienced variation of these and lessening of severity over seven days. By the next Wednesday she felt her normal self. She got both shots on Wednesday. She didn&#39;t have fever or any other problems that COVID people get. The patient had an infection on the abdomen. She took Cephalexin for 10 days. The infection on the abdomen started in early Mar2021. It was like a lump in Mar2021. She went to the dermatologist because there is cancer in her family. The dermatologist told her not to worry. Then it erupted like a big pimple in Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information on lot/batch number is available.

                                                Day of shot #2 (3/31/21) I experienced nausea in the first 15 minutes and felt confused while driving.  Nausea passed in 2-3 hours and I felt fine.  The next day I felt tired, foggy brain, and dizzy.  Assumed it was from the shot.  Side effects continued/worsened.  4/6/21 I saw my Dr.  She checked me over, labs. found nothing wrong with me.  Likely side effects from Pfizer.  Unlikely that they would last two weeks.  Rx Meclizine for dizziness, which didn&#39;t really help.  Now it&#39;s Day 15.  Tired and brain fog are gone.  I don&#39;t feel as dizzy.  BUT, when I try to drive, I feel QUITE dizzy with blurred vision.  This side effect persists and clearly effects my quality of life.

This 70-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6200, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Feb2021, 12:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). The patient was not pregnant. Medical history included colon polyps and diverticulosis. Allergies to medications, food, or other products included premarin, ambien and many seasonal allergies. Co-suspect medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) for diverticulitis. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included acebutolol hydrochloride (SECTRAL), allopurinol, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) and amitriptyline. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Jan2021, 13:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18 Mar2021, 4 weeks after second vaccine, the patient took Augmentin for recurring diverticulitis. For the last few years, the patient has taken the Augmentin once or twice a year to treat the problem (alternative to the flagyl/cipro regimine) and she have never had any problems. This time, on the 3rd day of the Augmentin, the patient broke out in large hives, (palm sized) and had swollen earlobes and a swollen palm on her right hand. The next day on 19Mar2021 she had swollen upper and lower lips. The patient took lots of Benadryl and Zyrtec, and by the 5th day her hives and horrendous itching went away. The patient does not know if the vaccine played any role in this at all. She just thought she should report since prior to the vaccine she never had a problem with Augmentin. The patient had absolutely no reaction at all to the Pfizer Covid vaccine itself after either of the doses. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. The outcome of all the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

Patient was given TPA in the past she was within window and she was then transferred here for further management.  Patient&#39;s symptoms continue to resolve.  She was admitted in the ICU and managed by neuro critical care and neurology.  Further imaging including CTA head and neck, MRI brain did not reveal any stroke.  An assessment of small vessel disease was made which likely resolved after TPA was given.  Patient was assessed by PMR and PT/OT and deemed safe to go home with family care and no restrictions.  Echo, telemetry and EKG showed no signs of cardiac involvement.  Patient was started Plavix x21 days and chronic baby aspirin.  She was also started on Crestor 20 mg daily.  Patient is to follow-up with neurology in 3 months as she got TPA.  She will also follow-up with her PCP on discharge.

This time, about 12 hours after receiving the shot, I began to feel aches and pains (like a cold was coming on). During the night I had some chills and the next day I was very achy and very tired. I napped about 4 hours during the day and was asleep by 8p.m. and slept for 12 hours. The next day (second day after the shot), the aches receded but I was still very lethargic for about another 8 hours.  I began to feel &#39;normal&#39; by evening and am felling OK today (third day after the shot). I did drink a lot of water during the whole time as I felt very thirsty (and I am normally a big water drinker!) I also had no appetite until this morning.

A nurse took my vitals and they were normal, although the BP was on the low side (I believe 95/54). They had me lie back in a recliner and kept checking me. After about 45 minutes my vision cleared and I sat up. About 10 minutes later I walked within the hospital to be sure I was safe to drive, and I was. The doctor on duty did also check me before I left.

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A 71-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL 9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jan2021 16:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid, allergies: Sulfites in foods and drugs, allergies: Penicillin. Concomitant medications included metformin at 800 mg, twice a day and levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN) at 75mg, once a day. The patient previously took sulfur and experienced allergies: sulfur. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 22Jan2021, at 16:15, the patient reported nose felt tingly front teeth and right side of my tongue felt numb. The patient carries an epi pen for an allergic reaction as the patient have to sulfites in foods and drugs (sulfur and penicillin allergies). The patient did not have to call for help or use epi-pen but was concerned somewhat for the second dose in 19 days. The events was considered as non-serious by the consumer. When the patient went home about 15 minutes later still felt this, hence the therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events included treatment with 2tbl Benadryl and 1/2 Zertex and within 30 minutes the patient was ok. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

That night when I went to bed I felt chilled and woke up several times feeling chilled.  In the morning I felt sick with similar symptoms as when I had COVID-19 in March2020. I had head pains, inner ear pains, naseau, sore muscles, and extreme fatigue. I slept the whole day, waking up and going back to sleep. I dranka little, but just didn&#39;t feel like it. I ate a piece of toast with butter that evening and then felt naseauated.  I slept through the night and woke up feeling a little better the next day, but still feel tired and have some pains in my head.

Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 23Mar2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: Jul2021) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included low magnesium, low vitamin D, allergy to Band-Aids, skin adhesives, and allergy to polyurethane spray tan (She&#39;s had a reaction to polyurethane on wood floors at her dad&#39;s house. Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration, in right arm, on 02Mar2021 (at the age of 71 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia, blood pressure (abnormal), blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medications included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) for fibromyalgia, metoprolol for blood pressure; atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) for cholesterol; vitamin d3 for vitamin; ubidecarenone (COQ10) for vitamin; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]; and calcium carbonate (CALTRATE). The patient had no history of previous immunizations and no additional vaccines administered on the same date. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient developed an adverse event from the vaccine, in which her doctor prescribed her to receive steroid injections in her ear drum to help with tinnitus and hearing loss experienced from the vaccine on 22Mar2021. The patient is two weeks post second vaccine administration and asked if she can take a steroid orally rather than having to get it injected into her ear drum. The patient stated that she can&#39;t be absolutely sure that this adverse event was from the vaccine. She further reported that she had the first dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021. On 22Mar2021, she woke up completely deaf in one ear and it was diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL). Stated that along with that, she had had severe ringing in the ear, like tinnitus type of condition. Stated that she went to the doctor on 22Mar2021 to the ear, nose, throat (ENT) doctor and stated that he was not absolutely sure. Stated that in the ENT industry is looking at the fact that they are having many patients coming in with this condition. They don&#39;t know if this is because of the vaccine or the fact that so many people are getting the vaccine. They are seeing an up rise in this condition and are dealing with it.  Stated that the doctor didn&#39;t want to give oral steroids, which is the recommendation because, she was having the second dose of vaccine on 23Mar2021. Decided to inject steroid into ear drum instead of doing it orally because he didn&#39;t want to kind of cancel out the vaccine. States that she still does not know if the ringing, tinnitus is from the vaccine or not. Stated that she has now had 3 injections of this steroid directly into her ear. Further, ringing in ear started as mild ringing and she woke up completely deaf in that ear. The patient got the third injection on 02Apr2021. After the first injection, started getting some hearing back, not much, but is a little improved. Stated that it is slightly improved. She does not know the name of the injected steroid. States that currently, as recommended by her doctor, is undergoing HBOT therapy, which is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Stated that it is known to be helpful in this SSHL condition. Stated that she has had 5 treatments and is going to continue until 20 treatments. The event required a visit at physician office. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on unspecified date to make sure, there are two things in the brain that could cause loss of hearing; 1 is a tumor and one is something else and the patient don&#39;t have either. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event. Outcome of the event was recovering.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL3249), intramuscular on the right arm, at the age of 72 years, on 13Jan2021 09:45 at a SINGLE  DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason&#39;s she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn&#39;t feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria). The outcome of the event onset of burning and itching and skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over was recovered on an unspecified date while other events were unknown.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

She got her last flu shot in Oct2020, no adverse events with that or other flu shots historically. On the second dose of Pneumococcal vaccine, it swelled her arm up from the injection site all the way down to her wrist; she went to the urgent care for that. They gave her some medicine and eventually the adverse event went away. She experienced some side effects following that injection. The patient reported that in the morning of the 20Jan2021, she was weak and just kind of rested. She did not have any other side effects until 21Jan2021. At 5am on 21Jan2021, for the whole day she had a fast heart rate, 125bpm, she woke up with her heart rate up, fast heartbeat, then down to 110 and then just toggled a little bit, she had blurry eyes so she could not really focus her eyes, weakness and dizziness. These events continued all throughout 21Jan2021 but her heart rate came down, it was running in the 90s and she was weak all day. Her blood pressure was also up on 21Jan2021. She thinks the blurry eyes, with her eyes being squirrely was related to her heart rate being up and blood pressure being up. She feels like she recovered completely from these events by this morning 22Jan2021. She feels good, strong and her eyes are clear today, felt better than yesterday but not 100%. She has probably shrunk in height, her last known height was 5&#39; 9. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose as scheduled for 12Feb2021 in response to the side effects. Outcome of the event &#39;she has probably shrunk in height&#39; was unknown while the rest of the events was recovered on 22Jan2021.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

Symptoms disappeared within, say, a half hour and did not return.  The following morning I had fleeting head aches on right side - each lasting a&#39; second or so only, and several hours apart.   By the afternoon they disappeared.  I am having no other symptoms.   My arm never hurt at the injection site.   I&#39;m not even  concerned but feel I should mention this reaction because I will be getting a second shot on March 16.  Is it safe?  Again, I have no symptoms any longer and feel great.

Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

She has h/o elevated BP and &#34;flushed&#34; feeling with various meds including once when she was doing a bowel prep for a colonoscopy. We decided to monitor her for 30 minutes and she felt fine throughout. As she was walking to her car she felt &#34;flushed&#34; and a bit light headed so she returned to the monitoring area. Initial BP was 189/77, pulse 110, O2 sat 100%. We brought her to the back room so she could sit in a recliner and remove her mask. Subsequent BP 186/77, pulse 86 then 184/69, pulse 80 about 20 minutes later. O2 sat remained upper 90s to 100%.  She continued to report feeling &#34;flushed&#34; and noted pressure/pain behind her left eye so we elected to call EMS (and this was also patient request to go to the ED) so she could be evaluated. She drove herself to appointment. Her plan was to call her son to have him meet her at the ED. She left via ambulance in stable condition.

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; brand: Pfizer; lot number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 16Feb2021 at 01:15 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to medications, food, or other products: dairy and pineapple. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; brand: Pfizer; lot number: EL8982) at left arm on 29Jan2021 at 01:15 PM for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) and vitamin D nos. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was other. As soon as the nurse started to administer the shot the patient could taste metal in her mouth. Within minutes she started to get over heated and breathing slightly difficult. She opened all the windows in the car and reminded herself that she was breathing and could blow the horn at any time. Difficulty breathing lasted minutes but the overheating about 20 minutes. Once she cooled down all symptoms disappeared. Adverse event start date was reported as on 16Feb2021 at 01:15 PM. The events were reported as non-serious. No treatment received for events. The outcome of events was resolved on 16Feb2021. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

I then began having peripheral flashing lights of all colors going every which way around my vision.  I rested for a few minutes and then checked it by attempting to read but could not keep the letters and words in order,.  This continued for 45 minutes. When I called my dr. They told me to go to the ED and get checked out.  ED Dr. checked for signs of stroke, which there were none. He felt it was related to vaccine.

                                                pain in chest through back; tongue swelled up; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; lot number EL9764/EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 01Feb2021 09:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing three stents in her artery, heart issue where they took test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, penicillin allergy, IV iodine allergy, allergy to pollens, inhalants, dust and animals. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin (DILANTIN), bacitracin;neomycin sulfate;polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and cefalexin (KEFLEX); all of which patient experienced allergies/ drug hypersensitivity. On 01Feb2021 09:45, immediately after receiving the vaccine, her tongue swelled up, she had difficulty swallowing, and she has a pain in her chest that went through to her back. The patient was sent and admitted to the ER and got an IV shot injection of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) that got tongue back down. She didn&#39;t need an Epi pen, it wasn&#39;t that bad. They took the test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative. The patient was advised by the head of ER that she shouldn&#39;t get the second shot because of the reaction. It could be more severe with the second dose he said. The outcome of the events was recovered on 01Feb2021.

                                                Chills; Irritation in throat; Swelling of tongue; Unable to swallow solids; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6202), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 25Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported; She takes other unspecified medications, though declined to provide details. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (Lot EM9809) on 04Feb2021 as first single dose for covid-19 immunization and hydrochlorothiazide and experienced anaphylactic reaction on an unspecified date (reported as years ago).   The patient experienced the following medically significant events:  irritation in throat on 27Feb2021 with outcome of recovered; swelling of tongue on 27Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered; unable to swallow solids on 27Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered; chills on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the reporting nurse received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. She received the first dose on 04Feb2021. She received the second dose on 25Feb2021. 48 hours after the second dose she developed a really sore throat way down in the back of her throat. Her tongue also started swelling. She took diphenhydramine (ASSURED) 50mg. Her tongue was swollen the next day and she was unable to swallow solids.  She went to a Covid clinic and was prescribed a diphenhydramine mouthwash. She was still unable to swallow. She has been taking diphenhydramine and Ibuprofen. It waxes and wanes.  She had to take diphenhydramine to go to sleep. She thinks it is a reaction to the vaccine. She read about the ingredients and is not allergic to anything in the vaccine. She clarified that she did not have a sore throat. Her throat was irritated. It felt like pop rocks in the back of her throat. She saw a provider on 01Mar2021. She thinks her histamine level is too high. She also had chills last night, date unspecified. She had them once since 27Feb2021 and again last night. She was unable to confirm if they are ongoing or resolved. She had to turn up her electric blanket to 8. She was not shaking but just had chills.  Years ago she had an anaphylactic reaction to hydrochlorothiazide. This felt similar to that. She was walking around fine and then started having swelling. She did not have difficulty breathing. She hoped it was not anaphylaxis. The diphenhydramine mouthwash was a compound of lidocaine, diphenhydramine and Maalox. The ratio was 1:1:1. The diphenhydramine 50 mg was a liquid children&#39;s allergy relief medication. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as aforementioned. Relatedness of drug to reaction for irritation in throat, swelling of tongue, unable to swallow solids and chills per primary source reporter  of assessment was reported as related. The outcome of irritation in throat was recovered on 28Feb2021; the outcome of swelling of tongue  and unable to swallow solids was not recovered; the outcome of chills was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of  irritation in throat, swelling of tongue, unable to swallow solids  due to temporal relationship and the known product safety profile.  The clinical presentation is suggestive of a severe allergic reaction, involving the tongue and throat.  There is limited information provided in this report.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

                                                Eye swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.   A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 08Mar2021 (at age of 74-year-old)(Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included detached retina, cataract, eye surgery on 12Feb2021, and hit the head on the freezer door. Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; potassium chloride taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamins NOS (MULTIVITAMINS) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. There was no History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect or additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  The patient experienced eye swelling on 08Mar2021. The reported seriousness criteria was medically significant. The events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit.  Time the Vaccination Was Given: 2:15-3:00 pm. The patient had the vaccine then she went to her retina specialist right after, she had a detached retina prior to receiving the vaccine. At the retina appointment before the vaccine she didn&#39;t have edema within her eye, at this appointment she had new onset edema inside of her eye. The edema was on the right, the vaccine was on the left. The patient knows there are lymph nodes around the eye and she has a weird body. The patient wants to know if other people have experienced this. There is edema inside the eye. The patient wonders if the vaccine interacted with the oil given during the retina exam. The patient had cataract surgery done and then had a hole in her retina following the surgery. The hole got worse and she had to go for surgery on 12Feb2021, then she had 3 month appointments.  The patient didn&#39;t not know if she still has the eye swelling, she went back to her retina doctor on 19Apr2021. The retina doctor put her on eye drops after they found the eye swelling. The patient mentioned that she stopped the eye drops that she was taking after her surgery a week before she received the vaccine. The patient hit her head on the freezer door right before her retina detached, the doctors said that it did not cause the retina to detach but she thought it was related because she hit her head really hard.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of eye swelling (eye swelling). The outcome of event was unknown. The patient thought this eye swelling may be related to the vaccine but she is unsure.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between eye swelling and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

                                                I had two symptoms that are normal, they were on the list of side effects, I had soreness on my left arm, I couldn&#39;t sleep on my left arm due to this soreness. This started the day the soreness started. The following day and up till now I felt very tired and like I needed to take a nap. Due to work I have not been able to nap. On Sunday I noticed I had a fever blister on the right side of face, under my lip by my chin. It looked like a herpes blister. I rarely get them unless there is a serious stressor to my body or if my body is emotionally stressed. Valacyclozir I took 4 of those in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening after noticing them. I put a cream on the blister. On Tuesday or Wednesday 3 or 4 days after the vaccine I felt a pain in my gum by back two teeth, the gums were very painful when I brushed my teeth or put my tongue on it.  I went to the dentist Friday the 22nd, however the dentist said it was intraoral herpes that he believes it is looked to the vaccine. Dr. believes the COVID vaccine activated the dormant herpes in my system . He said says it is located over the Greater Palatine Foramen.  The herpes on my chin went away. I still feel light sensitivity and fatigued. Dr recommended to see my dermatologist. Either the 22nd or 23rd I had a virutal appointment with my dermatologist. She recommended I take 4 Valacyclozir in the AM and PM. And then 1 day for 10 days. Both doctors recommended not getting the 2nd dose until the herpes vaccine goes away. Once it goes away they suggested taking the Valacyclozir before taking the 2nd dose. I am still not feeling normal. My dentist said he was going to consult a group of dentists to see if any other dentists have seen the correlation between the COVID vaccine and activating the herpes virus.  I plan to consult my PCP about if I should delay the 2nd dose.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 13:45 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension and atrial fibrillation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL), diltiazem (DILTIAZEM), rivaroxaban (XARELTO) and estrogen/methyl te. The patient previously had the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020. The patient stated, &#34;I woke from sleep about 12 hours later (10Jan2021) with rigors, muscle aches, head ache and pain in my inner ears as well as photophobia and feeling of exhaustion. The rigors had resolved by 8am but other symptoms persisted. I was too weak to walk further than the bathroom. I was able to consume only warm liquids, although I had no nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Note that since onset post infectious irritable bowel symptoms in February after visiting a city, weeks before the pandemic was recognized, I have had very abnormal but not absent sense of taste and smell, making me wonder whether I was infected in February without the usual symptoms.&#34; The patient recovered from rigors on 10Jan2021, outcome of the event weakness was unknown while other events were not recovered.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

                                                About 11 am I was masked in church and developed a tickle in my throat.  I cleared my throat to no relief.  I took 2 cough drops. About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.
