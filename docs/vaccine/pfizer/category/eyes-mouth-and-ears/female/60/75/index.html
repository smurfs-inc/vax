A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 14:56 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension, previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic.  Concomitant medication included nifedipine, carvedilol.  Consumer stated, &#34;About 15 minutes into after getting the injection, I was sitting to the site they asked me to stay longer because I previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic (Unspecified Medication).So that was within the 15 minute mark I started getting ringing in my ears and at the 20 mark I had migraine. I had them since I was about 9, they were diagnosed, it triggered a migraine. Although the ringing had gotten better in the last year but it is really bad in the right and it is now causing me (incomplete sentence).&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;I am probably say like I am yelling at you. I cannot hear and my son keeps telling me mom you are yelling. I did not see that I am &#39;ringing to your sheath&#39; ringing in the ear, the headache. I just see my headache is better today. I had a little bit of it but nothing you know Excedrin or something would take care of not enough for me to go take that but it is the ringing and I cannot hear out of that ear. I put my phone up and ringed up. Consumer stated, &#34;Recently my mom had COVID (further not clarified), I barely heard it. On the 23rd of Dec and I keep in contact with my family,they are 13 of us and I picked up the phone and instinctively put it to my right ear, I could not hear and I kept looking at the phone and I thought wait a minute and I put it to my left seems to be okay. It is the right I cannot hear.&#34;  Consumer further added, &#34;I am a Nurse so you expect this, that is why I waited this long because I got the injection at like 3 O&#39;clock yesterday and I waited even longer thinking maybe it will just go away and So I know you guys want to know everything that is going on. So I said wise better to call.&#34; Date of vaccination: Consumer stated, &#34;04Jan2021 (Clarified as 04Jan2021) and the time was 2:56 PM.&#34; Consumer further added, &#34;It is the only thing I could think of. It is the only thing that I could think of that I did differently out of my daily habits to go get this injection. I would say within 15 minutes it just started turning my head and I was like wait a minute I am having ringing and then they had music playing above our head, it sounded like everything was muffled then I turn my head to the right I could hear better and they kept turning my head and one of the administrators at the table started looking at me so I get up and I said you know what I am having ringing in my ear so they had me seated there a bit longer.&#34; Dose and route of administration: Consumer stated, &#34;I think she pulled up one cc that I saw and I got it in my left deltoid.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;No.&#34; Causality: Consumer stated, &#34;I would have to say because it  started like say in the 15 minute mark and then the headache came in about 20 minute mark.&#34; The outcome of the event Headache was resolved while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on the arm left on 05Jan2021 around 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient used to get legs cramps when she was pregnant with her twins, but it was only one leg. The patient stated she delivered six children, was in car accidents, and had surgeries. And the patient stated the pain from the COVID-19 Vaccine was beyond any other pain she has experienced. The patient needed glasses to read patient card. And stated her eyesight was going. The patient was pretty healthy. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.

All the events (except for event bruise at injection site) were reported as seriousness as life threatening. Clinical course: the patient worked nightshift. Laid down that afternoon to take a nap and got up around 10:00. Around 05Jan2021 19:00 PM had sever leg cramps in both legs where her toes were curled out. Leg cramps after vaccine wouldn&#39;t go away and it was in both legs. Just wouldn&#39;t go away. Around 05Jan2021 21:00 PM it went away. The patient was dizzy, nauseous, and threw up twice on the night of 05Jan2021, and going into 06Jan2021. The patient went to the couch in the hotel room and started going deaf. She couldn&#39;t hear anything on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Woke up at 09:35.

Couldn&#39;t reach the phone to dial 9-11. Thought she was going to die. Last until about noon and then started to go away. Doesn&#39;t know if it is safe to take the second vaccine. Doesn&#39;t know if these are thing that should have happened to her. She started to get real concerned. Went into hotel room and started feeling dizzy again. Stopped haring things. Funny feeling in her ears. Was seeing things, got dizzy, and everything got dark. Everything lasted until 12:00 PM on 06Jan2021. Everything was good now.

The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021.

She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130.

The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room. The patient had reactions: itching, rash, swelling, welts, shingle like rash on tailbone, genital area, hips moving to her face, itching and inflammation, in eyes as well. She wanted to know if the 2nd dose was recommended. It was &#34;like an anaphylactic reaction but not in her throat.&#34; itching around the genital area, vulva started from 04Jan2021, vulva was swollen started from 05Jan2021; Rash vulva started from 06Jan2021 to 10Jan2021; rash down her thighs started from 07Jan2021; Raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles started from 06Jan2021, whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy from 07Jan2021; itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see started from 06Jan2021; raised itchy area on her left cheek and eyes started from 07Jan2021; Headache dull started from 06Jan2021.

A 61-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL1284; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 06Jan2021 07:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunization, administered at hospital. Medical history included pacemaker for bradycardia w/syncopal episodes; and allergy to poppy seeds and pineapple. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), colecalciferol (VIT D3), and an unspecified multivitamin (other medications received within two weeks of vaccination). No other vaccines received within four weeks prior to covid vaccine. The patient previously took morphine and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested with covid-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced metallic taste in her mouth approximately one minute after receiving the vaccine on 06Jan2021 07:15; it lingered for about six hours (13:15). The event was reported non-serious. The patient did not receive treatment for this event. The outcome of the event was recovered on 06Jan2021 13:15.

I also started feeling lightheaded like I might faint. I pull over into a parking lot and had a family member come get me to drive me home. I was extremely thirsty and drank a lot of water at home. Eventually, my redness went away and my face did not feel as hot.  I did feel other more typical symptoms too such as painful arm, and flu like symptoms. I am mainly concerned about the reaction I had when driving home since it was similar to what happens when I take cortisone or Doxycycline.  I am needing information as to whether it is safe for me to take my second dose of the covid vaccine.

Scheduled day off from work day after vaccination but also a second day due to the severe headache mostly.

                                                After waiting 15 mins  I developed a dry throat and walked to my car (8-10 mins later). Began to develop difficulty swallowing by the time I reached my car.  Waited a few minutes and it did not abate and continued worsen,. Went to hospital&#39;s ER and was seen by Dr. At that time, my voice had become coarse and gravely. Was given oral steroid and a Benadryl.  Symptoms lessened a bit and were gone after about 2 hours. While at first I thought my breathing wasn&#39;t affected, after symptoms cleared, I realized that my breathing was easier. Symptoms did not reoccur.

At 1208 on 1/20/2021 pt received 2nd dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine. Immediately after vaccination, pt experienced unusual taste in mouth, flushing, and feeling of heat in chest.  At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips. Pt communicated with Dr advised to stay under observation, but transfer to ED not medically necessary. At 1415, pt was advised to go home with supervision of partner and monitor symptoms from there.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

A contactable consumer reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 report.   A 61-year-old female consumer (patient) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Covid Vaccine, lot number: EL1248) on 06Jan2021 at single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant drug included Multivitamin, Vitamin C, Vitamin D Zinc all from Mar2020 and ongoing. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EK5730) on 18Dec2020 in the right arm. Patient got COVID vaccine and a few hours later or the next day she started getting a hole in her retina and started losing her site in right eye. she went to the doctor as she has a hole in her retina. Again, this may be totally unrelated but she wanted to call and get this reported. She is going to see a retinal specialist this afternoon. After she had her COVID vaccine she had a bad headache for 3 days. She wore sunglasses in her house because the light bothered her eyes. She noticed this on 16Jan2021 because she was looking at paperwork and her eyes felt dry. She blinked a few times and had opened one eye alone, and she noticed that her left eye was fine but the vision in her right was not. This could have been going on longer. She just never closes only one eye. When both are open, her vision is normal. She saw the eye doctor yesterday, and that is when they said she had a hole in her retina. They said she will have to have surgery to close the hole. She knows she is at the right age for this to spontaneously happen, but just in case it is related, she wanted to report it. Outcome of the event Loss of vision in right eye was Not Recovered, for headache was recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

This 62 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3246) on 19Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 62 years old), in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) or on the same day: none. Medical history included ongoing trigeminal neuralgia (she had nerve issues, clarifying she was diagnosed about 6-1/2 years ago with trigeminal neuralgia that caused right-sided pain in her head and in her right ear), Raynaud&#39;s in her hands and feet since she was a kid. The patient previously took a 7-day course of levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and after that she had a diagnosis of ongoing erythromelalgia in her hands and feet and permanent ringing in ears, both since 2014, after she took, saying she functioned fine with the permanent ringing in her ears, she had gotten used it. She also felt horrible and had a muscle tear in her right arm a week after taking Levaquin. Concomitant medication included nortriptyline 20 mg capsule once daily (at night), ongoing since about 6-1/2 years ago, for trigeminal neuralgia. On 19Jan2021, 3 hours after vaccination, the patient experienced itching on the left side of her tongue. On the same day she had a little bit of swelling on the left side of her tongue. She took 1 generic 25 mg tablet of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) at 19:30 and was okay and slept fine. The next day it felt different but it wasn&#39;t itching. She had other autoimmune type things going on. Since an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient had been having more ear pain and usually took medicine for this but had not had ear pain in awhile. The patient said the left side of her tongue itching and swelling was enough to make her concerned. She also said she was concerned that there may be something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will activate her nerve issue since her right ear had been hurting her since Feb2021. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather was causing her right ear pain, but she had been on medication for over 6 years now that had been taking care of her right ear pain. She said she did not want to have the second COVID-19 vaccine injection if it was going to set off her nerve issue. She stated the doctors were thinking that she should get it but staying there and be monitored and not get it on her day off. She would be getting it at the student health center where she worked so she could be monitored and would have access to medical treatment if needed. Relevant tests: none. The events did not require ER visit or physician office visit. Itching on the left side of her tongue resolved on 19Feb2021. Swelling of tongue resolved on 20Feb2021. The other events outcome was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  autoimmune disorder and other events due to temporal relationship.

                                                About 5:30 or so and I was going to go to lunch at work - I felt like a heartburn and I was looking for a tums. I didn&#39;t have any. I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:00 in left deltoid at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, bilateral thyroidectomy in 2014. Family Medical History: Father died of lung cancer. Mother died of cardiac arrest in 1972. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for bilateral thyroidectomy. The patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 27Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

She went to the Urgent care on 06Feb2021, who told her to go to ENT. She has an ENT appointment on 09Feb2021. The Urgent care prescribed her a short dose of prednisone by mouth 10mg twice a day.

Mostly gone within 30 min. Went home. Left side of Parotid started swelling - at 12/24/2020 in the morning. I didn&#39;t notice anything wrong until I tried to eat breakfast. Very painful. Swelled up very large. Couldnt&#39; eat much for four days when I finally saw my dr (28th). and he gave  a prescription: an antibiotic and that started helping. When I  salivated it would start to swell. Pain was worse the first day and I massaged it alot to force saliva out of the grand. Tried to eat for very bland and very little on one side of mouth. Augmentin  Amox-Clad 875 mg. was the antibiotic I was given and that took about 24 hours to help.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021. She called her doctor on Monday and was seen by her doctor on Tuesday, 09Feb2021. The patient was referred to the eye center. Her headache was getting a little better. On 10Feb2021, the patient was seen at an institution, her retina and macula looked good, so she was referred to the ED. The patient was told she probably had a stroke. The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown. The has trouble reading now since the stroke.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to the vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent or underlying medical conditions in this elderly patient with excessive weight (BMI=29) and underlying elevated cholesterol.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose in her left arm for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no investigation assessment. It was reported that it had been 24 hours, she received her first bnt162b2 (reported as Pfizer COVID vaccine), yesterday (on 06Jan2021), and she was wondering, her arm was sore on 07Jan2021, which she thought was normal and fatigue on 06Jan2021, she got right away, she didn&#39;t know if that was normal, but she got a metallic taste in her mouth on 06Jan2021. It felt like a metallic taste when she swallows, a little metallic taste, yesterday (on 06Jan2021) was more than today, it was after the vaccine, about 7 hours after. She thought in her head, like the aluminum chewing gum, when kids chew it, it had a metallic taste, like the (company name withheld) wrapper she used to chew on it. Provides she was shrinking. Provide she was wearing stretch pants when providing weight. She Googled and didn&#39;t see the metallic taste, the only thing she saw with metallic taste is if you have the actual virus, she didn&#39;t have it, she was fine. Maybe it was all in her head. Arm was sore not right away, it built up, like when you stretch like with the flu shot, she lifted and it&#39;s sore, and she felt sleepy. It was like with the flu shot, it took a few days to go away. Last night on 06Jan2021, she was very sleepy, she was kind of sleepy, but it could be watching the Capitol and insanity, but she was yawning a lot more, her eyes felt heavy, she was ok, she had an appetite and is fine, she would drink (company name withheld) now. Thought she was peaking with it, she would go to sleep early today (07Jan2021), her eyes were still heavy, she wanted to close them and took a nap, but couldn&#39;t. It was like her saliva has a metallic taste in her mouth, it may be in her head, she googled to see side effects and when they start, it may be going soon, who knows, she was just wondering. The taste was worse yesterday (06Jan2021), and it wasn&#39;t IV or anything like that, the patient wanted to know how can that be. She had to go back on the 27th for her second dose. She had been tested and retested on an unspecified date, and it was offered for those 65 and over, and she was lucky to get an appointment. The outcome of the event metallic taste was recovering; the events fatigue and eyes heavy was not recovered; the outcome of the rest events was unknown.

The monitoring staff kept me under observation for 1.5 hours, and then I left after symptoms mostly subsided. I&#39;ve never had any adverse reaction to a vaccine or other medication ... although I tend to be medication sensitive so I avoid it if possible. My only allergies are seasonal/pollen (outdoor) and some indoor (mold, etc.) What was my reaction? Can I take the 2nd dose or not?

But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

She immediately began noticing that the words on her TV screen were not legible - her vision had become blurry. This blurriness was accompanied by severe eye pain and pain in the temples of her head. When shutting eyes and keeping them closed for a few hours, the blurriness would subside. However she continues to experience this blurriness &#39;on and off&#39; to date. Also experienced some mild headaches but they have subsided as of two days ago. Hasn&#39;t taken anything to alleviate the symptoms. Patient is extremely concerned that she may permanently lose vision and refuses to get 2nd dose.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

On 02/18/2021 late evening, started to feel burning in left eye nose area again, next morning eye swollen shut.  Saw Dr, said I was having an allergic reaction and put me on prednesone and Amoxicylin.  No reduction of swelling and burning, blisters were forming.  Went to Urgent Care on 2/20/2021 and was prescribed Acyclovir again.  Swelling now gone and itching burning diminished.

The day following the vaccination, wife began to suffer mild, common vaccination symptoms such as fatigue, hills, and joint pain.  In the days following, in addition to those symptoms, she began to cough and had a sore throat.  By March 8th, she had lost her sense of taste and sense of smell. We realized we needed to have her tested for COVID-19. We went to a testing area. She was seen and tested. She tested positive for COVID-19 (as did I).  The belief was that our illness was uncomplicated and we were sent home with instructions to monitor our symptoms.  On 03/14/2021, I took her to the hospital because her condition was worsening.

Eyes started hurting with burning sensation, pressure in both ears and slight numbness across face from ear to ear and under nose.  Uncomfortable tightness in chest and a lot of pressure on face feeling like it was hot. I felt a little better after 15 minutes while waiting but never told anyone about symptoms. I walked out and drove home but monitored my symptoms.  The symptoms gradually became less and were gone after 1 hour and 45 minutes. I took a dose of benadryl at that time.  I slept well that night and woke up with no symptoms and none since.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

I called Employee Health and they said to continue to monitor my temp and call back if it passes 100. Then around 3PM , my temp was 101.5F I remain very achy and have some occasional ear pain and a mild headache,

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

After receiving the second vaccine, I sneezed and had a constantly runny/blocked nasal passages for almost 24 hours.  It was a long night.  I must have sneezed more than 100 times.  Never had anything like this before in my life. about 10 AM the following day it simply stopped as fast as it started and has not reoccurred.  I received the Pfizer vaccine. Had muscle/joint aches but nothing that happened was a big deal

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 73-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 around 13:00-14:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient got the vaccine this week on 06Jan2021 right after lunch/early afternoon. She had no issues. In the afternoon of 07Jan2021, she started getting a little dizzy and had a hard time focusing her sight. The patient also had neck and toe stiffness on 07Jan2021. She did not think about the vaccine until last evening of 07Jan2021. The hospital called to see how she was doing, and then it dawned on her.

Also massive headache made my eyes light sensitive all day Saturday and Sunday until about 9PM.  Extreme exhaustion.  Recovering today, Monday.  Still tired an s slight residual headache at times but not bad enough for painkiller.

A 74-year-old female patient received her second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot EL3248, expiration Apr2021) at 6:00AM on 07Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had her first dose on 19Dec2020 and had side effects from it but very few. The patient was worked at COVID rooms to clean rooms in hospital as a housekeeper and so her exposer to the hospital made her in first group to get the vaccine. Medical history included allergies (had anaphylactic shock from Amoxicillin and from Tylenol, she cannot take Tylenol), anxiety, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) on regular basis, bisoprolol fumarate, loratadine (CLARITIN) for allergies, escitalopram for anxiety, mometasone furoate (FLONASE) for allergies, losartan, magnesium, omeprazole, and triamterene.

She could not even sit on the side of bed without falling to one side or the other or falling backwards so very weak and unable to move pretty much. She could not eat and lost appetite, and she developed the chills on that evening. On the third day (09Jan2021) she was running a temperature of 101 so it had gone down.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

                                                About 11 am I was masked in church and developed a tickle in my throat.  I cleared my throat to no relief.  I took 2 cough drops. About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.
