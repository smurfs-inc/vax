                                                Ringing in ears; Triggered to migraine; Cannot hear, Sounded like everything was muffled; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 14:56 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension, previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic.  Concomitant medication included nifedipine, carvedilol.  Consumer stated, &#34;About 15 minutes into after getting the injection, I was sitting to the site they asked me to stay longer because I previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic (Unspecified Medication).So that was within the 15 minute mark I started getting ringing in my ears and at the 20 mark I had migraine. I had them since I was about 9, they were diagnosed, it triggered a migraine. Although the ringing had gotten better in the last year but it is really bad in the right and it is now causing me (incomplete sentence).&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;I am probably say like I am yelling at you. I cannot hear and my son keeps telling me mom you are yelling. I did not see that I am &#39;ringing to your sheath&#39; ringing in the ear, the headache. I just see my headache is better today. I had a little bit of it but nothing you know Excedrin or something would take care of not enough for me to go take that but it is the ringing and I cannot hear out of that ear. I put my phone up and ringed up. Consumer stated, &#34;Recently my mom had COVID (further not clarified), I barely heard it. On the 23rd of Dec and I keep in contact with my family,they are 13 of us and I picked up the phone and instinctively put it to my right ear, I could not hear and I kept looking at the phone and I thought wait a minute and I put it to my left seems to be okay. It is the right I cannot hear.&#34;  Consumer further added, &#34;I am a Nurse so you expect this, that is why I waited this long because I got the injection at like 3 O&#39;clock yesterday and I waited even longer thinking maybe it will just go away and So I know you guys want to know everything that is going on. So I said wise better to call.&#34; Date of vaccination: Consumer stated, &#34;04Jan2021 (Clarified as 04Jan2021) and the time was 2:56 PM.&#34; Consumer further added, &#34;It is the only thing I could think of. It is the only thing that I could think of that I did differently out of my daily habits to go get this injection. I would say within 15 minutes it just started turning my head and I was like wait a minute I am having ringing and then they had music playing above our head, it sounded like everything was muffled then I turn my head to the right I could hear better and they kept turning my head and one of the administrators at the table started looking at me so I get up and I said you know what I am having ringing in my ear so they had me seated there a bit longer.&#34; Dose and route of administration: Consumer stated, &#34;I think she pulled up one cc that I saw and I got it in my left deltoid.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;No.&#34; Causality: Consumer stated, &#34;I would have to say because it  started like say in the 15 minute mark and then the headache came in about 20 minute mark.&#34; The outcome of the event Headache was resolved while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                On 12-24-2020 I started to have a metallic taste in my mouth and at 2:35pm I experienced rapid  heart beat with chest tightness. On the next day I  felt two places in body begin with hives and it grew with itchiness till the third day.  I had under-skin itchiness which grew  into hives. I did a telemedicine consult with a doctor who started me on Benadryl, for me to take it 3 times a day for Monday and Tuesday after Christmas (12-28-2020 and 12-29-2020).

                                                I had a rash on my face, started with itchy nose and eyes. The hives spread to the neck. I told the male nurse that was present and he said that had Epinephrine, I had benadryl and he said that I could take one. Half an hour later my rash got worse and I took 20 mg prednisone that I had for my asthma. During the next two days I have had palpitations, fatigue and tiredness. Today my blood pressure was high and I have never had it like that before.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on the arm left on 05Jan2021 around 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient used to get legs cramps when she was pregnant with her twins, but it was only one leg. The patient stated she delivered six children, was in car accidents, and had surgeries. And the patient stated the pain from the COVID-19 Vaccine was beyond any other pain she has experienced. The patient needed glasses to read patient card. And stated her eyesight was going. The patient was pretty healthy. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.

Couldn&#39;t reach the phone to dial 9-11. Thought she was going to die. Last until about noon and then started to go away. Doesn&#39;t know if it is safe to take the second vaccine. Doesn&#39;t know if these are thing that should have happened to her. She started to get real concerned. Went into hotel room and started feeling dizzy again. Stopped haring things. Funny feeling in her ears. Was seeing things, got dizzy, and everything got dark. Everything lasted until 12:00 PM on 06Jan2021. Everything was good now.

The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches. After the first one, it took 10 hours for the shivering to start. This time it was very similar. The shivering started about 10 hours later, at 9pm on 11Jan2021.

Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room. The patient had reactions: itching, rash, swelling, welts, shingle like rash on tailbone, genital area, hips moving to her face, itching and inflammation, in eyes as well. She wanted to know if the 2nd dose was recommended. It was &#34;like an anaphylactic reaction but not in her throat.&#34; itching around the genital area, vulva started from 04Jan2021, vulva was swollen started from 05Jan2021; Rash vulva started from 06Jan2021 to 10Jan2021; rash down her thighs started from 07Jan2021; Raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles started from 06Jan2021, whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy from 07Jan2021; itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see started from 06Jan2021; raised itchy area on her left cheek and eyes started from 07Jan2021; Headache dull started from 06Jan2021. The events Headache dull, itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see; whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy and raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles were reported as non-serious by the reporter and other events were considered as medical significant by the reporter. Investigation assessment for the events was reported as No. The outcome of the event anaphylactic reaction, inflammation in eye, welts was unknown, outcome of the event Rash vulva was recovered on 10Jan2021; of Headache dull, swelling eye was not recovered, of other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On Tuesday she woke up with a headache that gradually worsened. The headache was behind the right eye, the right ear, and the teeth on the right side also hurt.  Nothing helped taking Acetaminophen; Ibuprofen.  She went to sleep around 4:00 am finally, and then woke up 6 hours and the headache was gone.  Then you had hives located behind the right ear and down the neck, into the right shoulder.  They are also in her scalp.  They have now down to the tops of her legs, hips, and back and are spreading.   She called her doctor who called her in some prescriptions.

                                                About 30 hours after vaccine I had bumps on my shoulder blade on left side where I received the vaccine - a rash that itched.  It lasted about 4 or 5 hours - I put Calamine lotion on it and that soothed it.  I also experienced a little itching of eyes and a slight itching in mouth. About 9:30 pm I had a rapid heartbeat for about 30 or 40 minutes.  The itching sensation continued off and on the next day but bumps weren&#39;t visible any longer.  The itchy eyes continued off and on for the next day as well.

Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started coughing, lost my voice, Itchy eyelids, my chest was pounding, and overall just did not feel right. EMS Took my blood pressure and it was 255, then they waited a smidge and decided to give me an injection of Benadryl, within 10 minutes of the Benadryl my blood pressure went down to 225, and I overall felt a little bit better. My eyelids were still swollen and itchy and I didn?t have a voice, they took my blood pressure again and it went down to 218. They stayed with me. I was starting to feel a little bit better. My blood pressure went down to 180 and there?s no wheezing in my chest. They let me leave shortly after that. I still do not have a voice. My eyelids are still swollen slightly and very itchy and my lips tingle.

I did not eat anything until about 6 PM when my blood sugar began to lower.  At that time, I tried to eat some chicken soup, but after a few mouthfuls, my throat began to constrict and my tongue and the inside of my mouth began to itch.  This continued every time I began to try to eat something and I still could feel what felt like some constriction in the back of my throat the next day (Monday).

Later I was getting some sputum or phlegm coming up,, no cough, on short of breath no nasal discharge.   During the night I woke up because the phlegm was much worse and abundant    I wanted to sleep so at first was swallowing it,  then it was so much that I got up and went to the bathroom.  That is when I noticed that the palms of my hands were scarlet red.  on both hands and not on the wrists or any where else.    by morning it was gone but I did have diarrhea and still a cold mild nausea feeling in my stomach.   Yesterday , 3 days later,  still had diarrhea and nausea and was tired,,symptoms are not severe,   but since these are not typical symptoms for me.   I figured they will go away,  but also I figured that I should communicate the reaction .   I am scheduled for my 2nd shot in 3 weeks,

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills. Pain in calves, upper back, same on both sides.  6:38 weirdly, from the bottom of my thumb to halfway up my arm there is pain. Both arms simultaneously. Worse on the  left.  8:11 pm after bundling up and using a heating pad, plus extra heat, chills are lessened. Lymph nodes very sore in neck. Eyes are not quite as dry. Everything else is the same.  8:48 pm jaw really aches. Intestinal discomfort. Going to bed.  10:39 pm pain from jaw extended up into left ear. Upper part of throat hurts.  March 5, 2021  4:00 am. Body aches have lessened. Left arm sore at shot area.  5:45 am  eyes definitely dry, but not nearly as dry as yesterday. Numbness in mouth , tongue and face has lessened, but still uncomfortably present. Definitely worse on the left side. Little bit of tingling on the left, mostly on cheek from chin to ear. Headache gone. Lymph nodes sore and swollen .  7:00 am went on a walk. Noticed some achyness throughout body. Very tired.  10:51 am The tingling and numbness remain in my mouth, tongue and cheek up to my left eye.  Very tired. Lymph nodes still swollen and sore.

                                                Since the week after the first Pfizer vaccine, I began struggling with symptoms of diabetes. I experienced extreme thirst, frequent urination and  I lost 17 pounds in the 3 weeks following the first dose. I never associated it with the vaccine, initially, because I never heard of any side effects like increased glucose, and my dad and sister have type 2 diabetes, so I was altering my diet, but the symptoms did not subside. I proceeded to get the second vaccine and that?s when I knew something was seriously wrong. That afternoon my blood sugar was 528, my vision was blurred, and I experienced a strange feeling in my heart. I was diagnosed by my GP with diabetes, and put on medication (Metformin and Glipizide). I proceeded to see an endocrinologist, I was put on insulin and after additional blood tests was diagnosed with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes , and Premature Atrial Complexes.

                                                This is a 60-year-old female who just received her second Pfizer dose of the Covid vaccine earlier today when she says she felt immediately a flushing of her left arm where she had received the vaccination and then some tingling and abruptly followed with difficulty swallowing tongue enlargement, and feeling like she had to &#34;search for my air&#34;. This required her to turn her head leftward to assist in her breathing. She has no associated pruritus. She was given an intramuscular injection of epinephrine at the clinic where she received the vaccination and EMS was activated. She did not demonstrate any changes in her phonation or signs of stridor and there was no wheezing or signs of facial or oral swelling on arrival of paramedics. She received additional intramuscular injection of epinephrine and IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol at that time followed by an albuterol inhalation treatment and transported here as a medical alert. She reports the symptoms are similar to what she is experienced with multiple bee sting allergic reactions in the past. She is never required intubation. She never develops any facial swelling or urticaria.

Itchy red spots all over head, ears and neck, some on lower part of body.  Swollen lip.  Took two benadryl at 1:45 am Wednesday .  This helped to ease the itching.  Had a headache so on Wednesday morning I took two Tylenol and made a Dr. appt.  Also was weak and faintish on Wednesday when I got up.   Dr&#39;s said to keep taking anti-histamines and report to ER if tongue or throat starts to swell.

                                                within a couple of minutes after receiving the shot, I felt a sudden flash of warmth throughout my body. Then my heart started racing. This lasted about a minute. I just sat there since I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal. I started to feel like my heart was going back to normal so I just sat there for the specified 15 minutes. After I left and was driving home, I stated to feel a shortness of breath and difficulty getting air. I also felt like a hard to swallow. I was about 1 mile from venue so this happened with 30 minutes of receiving the shot. This only lasted what seemed like a short time and then I started to feel like I could get my breath. By the time I returned home I was breathing ok but my lips were a little tingly. I felt fine by 5:00 pm.

                                                60 yo woman who 3-5 minutes post vaccination developed facial itching and erythema, initially in her eyes and nose. Administered 50 mg diphenhydramine PO. In the minutes thereafter, the pruritis  spread to the upper lip, then face and scalp, and became more generalized (but mild) on limbs.  She also reported a &#34;dry throat&#34; sensation, but denies throat tightness or itching and did not have any respiratory compromise for the hour that she remained under observation. Symptoms subsided and patient left the facility. Followed up with her later by phone to inform her that her immediate allergic reaction was a contraindication to her receiving the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and that she should not return for a second appointment. Advised that she seek allergist consultation given her history of multiple allergies, and to determine whether there was a common substrate for any of them. Said that she could possibly consider the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine thereafter, if she did not have any known allergies to components of it.

                                                As I pulled up for the 15 minute wait period the symptoms started 5 minutes after I received my vaccine.  A tingling feeling up my left arm to back of my neck. My neck stiffened and then my throat started to close.  Not to where I can&#39;t swallow but just like when I eat food that I&#39;m allergic too, it closes up. The nurse that was overseeing me was holding the umbrella over my car window with the rainfall.  All of a sudden their was lightning &amp; thunder. The nurse threw the umbrella because she was shocked from the lightning. She started to talk to all the other around her and forgot about me. Since I could still swallow I didn&#39;t get her attention. When she returned she asked me the time so I had to pull my phone out. She didn&#39;t know the time of my 15 minutes and sent me away. As soon as I got out of the parking area but still inside amusement park, I started to feel my cheeks becoming numb and my right eye was blurry.  I quickly moved over to the side lane still inside of amusement park and waited.  I called my husband and told him that with the heavy rain I didn&#39;t feel safe driving with my right eye being blurry.  I waiting another 15 minutes before driving home.  That evening the blurriness came back, my eye&#39;s &amp; forehead was tender to touch but no headache.  Only pressure in my head.  My symptoms of closed throat, swollen cheeks, pressure in my head and blurriness continued on Friday, March 12th, Saturday, March 13th, Sunday, March 14th and Monday, March 15th.  As of today, no other systems other than feeling my body has inflammation.

                                                I had no side effects except a sore arm with both doses of the vaccine. Only this week I started to experience ringing in my ears (tinnitus) and I have never had that before. The only reason I thought it was related to the vaccine was that my husband experienced the same symptoms recently as well and he received both doses of  Moderna vaccine in January. I find it very strange that we are experiencing these symptoms now after more than a month of getting a second dose of the vaccine.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Feb2021 at 12:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to dust mites, dogs, and corn; Hashimoto&#39;s thyroid; and high blood pressure. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. She was not pregnant and did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included fluvoxamine maleate (LUVOX), thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID), and amlodipine. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was reported as other. The patient experienced swollen face, swollen puffy eyelids and below the eye, and itchy rash on face, neck, and chest on 14Feb2021 at 17:30. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.

                                                Within 1 hour after receiving  vaccine, approx 45 min., Both ears suddenly felt as if I was on a plane and was blocked as you would feel by altitude change.  I kept trying unblock by swallowing etc.  That last 15ish minutes followed by a constant sound in both ears as if someone was rubbing sand paper back and forth in front of each year.  That lasted 40-50 minutes.  Approximately 32 hours after feel like I have to keep swallowing to unblock my ears.  That altitude flucuation again feeling but not as bad as the first encounter.  This was related to the vaccine.  No doubt in my mine.  Never had anything like this before unless on an airplane.  Sand paper sound, never.   I let my physician know tonight via email.  In addition I felt dizzy within 5 minutes of receiving the injection.  Subsided within 15 -20 minutes.  Felt aloof the remainder of the day.  Also arm hurt so bad the next day I had to cancel golf.   Low grade fever plus headache

                                                Received the vaccine shot in the morning of March 24th, as the day wore on the vision in my right eye changed, becoming cloudy and somewhat obscured, it felt like i had some pressure or the right eyeball was swollen a bit,  I had difficulty focusing  close up, difficulty reading. When looking at distant objects, such as a street light, the light source looked like a spiky ring of light.  The vision in the left eye was a bit cloudy but that was gone by the morning of the 25th.  The vision issues in the right eye continued through most of the 25th though the feeling of pressure diminished and the  vision issues also lessened.  The eye/vision is still not completely back to normal on the 26th but is much better.

                                                Received first shot on 3/15/21. On 3/25/21, I developed a rash (hives) around 6:30-7pm. After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

                                                I experienced muscle and joint aches, headache and overall malaise.  Approximately 14 days after the first vaccine , started having vision deficits in my left eye out of the blue.  I experienced a fuzziness and haziness in the vision of the left eye and pain above the left eye brow.  Was seen urgently in the eye clinic on 3/29/21 and had a battery of tests - a swollen and inflamed left optic nerve was observed and some deficits to vision and peripheral vision.  Had second vaccine on 3/31/21 and eye seemed to get worse.   Seen by Optical Nerve Specialist on 4/5/21 and had battery of tests and optic nerve worse.  Dr. diagnosed as ischemic optical neuropathy likely due to giant cell artritis (GCA).  I had urgent/emergent temporal artery biopsy on 4/6/21 to determine if giant cell artritis.  Received results from biopsy on 4/13/21 and negative for GCA.  Saw Optical Nerve Specialist on 4/14/21 and diagnosed with ischemic optical neuropathy but cause can not be specified.  Optic nerve is still swollen and vision impacted.  I am to return to clinic in 8 weeks and see if improvement.  I have never had any issue like this in the past.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; I started to have sharp pain behind my ear; sinus congestion; deep sore throat; dry left eye; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP; patient). A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 at 16:00 (Lot Number: ER8733, expiry date not reported) at the age of 60-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The vaccination facility type was facility. The patient received no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Medical history included penicillin-rash; high cholesterol being treated with Repatha; slightly high blood pressure being treated with lisinopril; cysts in pancreas, thyroid and kidneys-all benign. Concomitant medications included evolocumab (REPATHA) for high cholesterol; lisinopril for slightly high blood pressure; spironolactone for an unspecified indication and testosterone for an unspecified indication, all start and stop dates were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine on 27Mar2021, 4 days later on 31Mar2021 20:30 she developed Bell&#39;s Palsy. She would like to know if in the clinical trials those who experienced this adverse event was after the first or the second dose of the vaccine. She already reported this adverse event to Safety, online and verbally. She would like to know if Pfizer recommends for people who develops Bell&#39;s Palsy after the first dose of the vaccine not to receive the second dose and if there&#39;s information about the cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy after receiving the vaccine during the vaccination to larger populations. She&#39;s also wondering if there is information about how long it takes to resolve. Patient reported that four days after vaccination on 31Mar2021 at 20:30, she started to have sharp pain behind her ear, sinus congestion, deep sore throat, and dry left eye, went to bed, next morning she woke up with Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (also reported to have occurred on 31Mar2021 20:30). These resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient was treated with high dose prednisone and Valtrex. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Bell&#39;s palsy is not uncommon in general population, however the causal association between bell&#39;s palsy and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded because of strong temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Ex-piry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 on an unknown ana-tomical location as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Caller provided that her sister got the vaccine for COVID Prevention and because the patient has a handicapped, bedridden husband who has MS and is immune compromised, and it was to help prevent him from getting sick. Caller reported that the patient received the product during the daytime, all the women at the patient&#39;s job, which was home health payroll, everyone left to get the vaccine during work hours, like in the AM at around lunch time. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient has not received any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the suspect product. Patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) on 08Feb2021 with no reaction. She worked for a health agency and the whole office went and got it. Caller provided that her sister had a reaction the first time, on 03Apr2021, where her sister woke up with itching started in her hands and ended up migrating to her whole body. By morning patient&#39;s tongue had swelled up, couldn&#39;t swallow and her voice was scratchy, like the caller couldn&#39;t understand her sister&#39;s speech well. Caller provided that her sister went to the ER and said there was a whole team giving her urgent care, medication, and such. Caller reported that her sister said the ER didn&#39;t find anything in her bloodwork, and the caller did not think the patient was being treated for any other medical conditions, and caller did not think her sister is on any medications, but caller said to not quote her on that. Caller knew her sister had a weight problem, but she did not know if her sister needed blood pressure medication or anything. Caller reported her sister said that the bloodwork from the ER did not find any-thing, and the patient was not admitted to the hospital. Caller reported that at this time, her sister&#39;s adverse events were no longer ongoing as her sister was given Steroids, like Prednisone, Benadryl and Famotidine, and she took those products as recommended by the doctor. Caller did not know the end date of her sister&#39;s events; all she knew was that the reaction initially started on 03Apr2021. Caller stated that her sister was allergic to nothing, and she has never had incidences of itching like that, where the itching was so bad that she was stripping down and the patient&#39;s daughter was patting the patient down with witch hazel. Caller stated that ER released the patient and gave her some medications and such. Caller stated that a day or so later, there was a second round of reaction: the right side of the patient&#39;s face swelled up and numb and her lips were numb, like when people have a dental procedure. Lips were numb for a while. Upon completion of the medications she was given, the reactions stopped. Patient regularly saw the family doctor. She would go back to see her Doctor on Thursday. HCP Information was unknown to the caller, but caller stated that her sister had been recommended to go to her PCP and get an Epi Pen. Caller stated that knock on wood, so far, her sister was holding her own, and it had not happened again. Caller stated that she was reporting the data that her sister gave to her after having the Pfizer vaccination. Caller stated the patient had an anaphylactic reaction twice that caused her to go to the emergency room. No relevant tests were done. Caller stated that she had the dates that she had her shots and where she had her shot at. Caller stated somebody called and reported it already. Caller stated she was trying to press three but never could figure out which prompts was. Caller stated they said if she called this number, they would tell her at the medical information department if this occurrence has happened to other people, like statistics. Caller stated they tried to call this number, but it was too long of a wait. Caller stated that she did not have the vaccination card, she never asked for them. Caller does not have card with her at time of call for LOT, NDC, Expiry date. Caller stated that she knew that all the COVID vaccines are just in the Emergency Use Authorization stage and in clinical trials, but caller really thought that all manufacturers should be advertising that they would like feedback from patients. Caller has not heard anything from any of the manufacturers saying that people are welcome to reach out and report side effects. Caller states that she only knew to call because she used to be a Home Health Worker, and she thought this is an important data. Caller has never seen on any of her 19 TV channels about calling to report. Caller stated that the girl who first answered her call, read a clinical data sheet about joint pain being seen in 23% of patient&#39;s and not knowing a percentage for anaphylactic reactions, caller was wondering if this was true. Caller verified that she just wanted to ask basically that patient was not alone, if other people might have had that happen too. Caller stated that she tried to call, and it would ask another question and it would say press 1 or 2, then it would ask other questions and it would say press 1 or 2, she never got an option 3. Caller asked: how much percentage, has anyone reported this side effects weeks after the second dose. Caller was wondering if this reaction could have been from the vaccine. Investigation Assessment: No. The outcome of the events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8731), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 08Apr2021 10:41 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 60 years). Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ongoing chronic kidney disease and Positive ANA. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received her first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8727) on 18Mar2021 for covid-19 immunisation and experienced First dose: a little bit of soreness and swelling all on the site. The patient stated that during her second dose last Thursday on 08Apr2021, she had an anaphylactic reaction and she couldn&#39;t breathe and long story short she had to go to the emergency room and she was given all kinds of epi shots and treatment and stuff and eventually she had to be kept in the ICU unit. She is not sure why she had such a severe reaction. She wanted to report that since then she has kept track every day on how she has been and she actually thought yesterday was the first day that she had felt better. She had extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, upper back pain and even a bloody nose on 10Apr2021 and also she couldn&#39;t see out of her left eye for about 2 hours. Then on 11Apr2021, she had severe pain at the back of her neck with a headache that lasted about 20 minutes and she couldn&#39;t move her neck. She had diarrhea and the only temperature she had was on 12Apr2021, it was only 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn&#39;t bad, but she had really bad diarrhea on 12Apr2021 and she took Imodium. She had a headache and slight breathing difficulties and things like that. On 13Apr2021 she had a headache, was really weak, had leg aches, fatigue that was really bad and she couldn&#39;t stay awake and her temperature that day was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit which is normal. Then yesterday, 15Apr2021, she thought she was over all the things and that she was feeling better from the fatigue, nausea (occurred on an unspecified date), lightheadedness but she couldn&#39;t sleep again. She didn&#39;t sleep since Wednesday morning until last night finally and she only slept for an hour since Wednesday morning. She woke up on 15Apr2021 and had no symptoms except her left and her right hips, both, had severe pain and she could barely walk and she couldn&#39;t bend at all. All she could do it take Tylenol and she used a heating pad and the pain was excruciating. She went to bed last night and she did sleep for maybe a total of 2 hours and when she woke up this morning her left hip seemed to be a little better but her right hip is still in severe pain and now her right knee joint is in severe pain too. Other than that, she has no other symptoms just the joint pain. She didn&#39;t know it would go on for this long, it has been over a week now and she just wanted to let us know about this. The patient was hospitalized for the event anaphylactic reaction from 08Apr2021 to 08Apr2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Blood typing: anti kell antibodies (doctor randomly decided to do a blood typing and they found anti kell antibodies in her blood) on an unspecified date, temperature: 99.5 degrees fahrenheit on 12Apr2021, temperature: 98.7 degrees fahrenheit on 13Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of anaphylactic reaction, dyspnoea, diarrhea and arthralgia. Outcome of the event anaphylactic reaction was recovered with sequelae on 09Apr2021 while outcome of the events nausea, dyspnea, arthralgia, sleep disorder and movement disorder was unknown. Outcome of the event vision impairment was recovered on 10Apr2021 while outcome of the event neck pain was recovered on 11Apr2021. Outcome of the remaining events was recovered on 15Apr2021.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: EW0ISO) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included she had lupus, sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications not reported. The patient previously took Pneumonia Vaccine on 04Mar2021 (Anatomical Location: Left arm); took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: the lot number starts with ER something and then it ends with a 3) as single dose for covid-19 immunization; took azathioprine for lupus and had allergic reaction; took belimumab (BENLYSTA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Lot Number: PV7G; Expiration Date: Jun2023, NDC: 49401-088-01, Number on the side: 0147098) to an unspecified date, self injection once a week for lupus. She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn&#39;t super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn&#39;t done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn&#39;t stop and she told herself that if it didn&#39;t stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn&#39;t been eating a lot so she hasn&#39;t had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn&#39;t swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can&#39;t recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn&#39;t even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn&#39;t help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren&#39;s disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous&#34; was recovered on 17Apr2021. The outcome of events &#34;Feeling of warmth, Vaccination site pain, Hyperaesthesia, Vaccination site erythema, Tiredness&#34; not recovered. The outcome of the event &#34;Headache&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 03Feb2021 17:40 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation, offered at the health system she works for and administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing acoustic neuroma on 8th cranial nerve left side, on the side she felt the intense ear pain, diagnosed 2007-2008, thyroid cancer from 2004 and thyroid removed, her hormone levels are normal, COVID-19 in Dec2020.

There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced I feel pretty awful in Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, ear pain on 03Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, sense of fullness in ears and lymph nodes on 03Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 05Feb2021, body aches on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache on 04Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, sleepiness on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, fatigue on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, body temperature: 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021 with outcome of unknown. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The course of events was as follows: Patient expected that since she just had COVID in Dec2020, she thought her response to the vaccine would not be severe because she already had some immunity from the infection. The evening of the vaccine, on 03Feb2021, she experienced ear pain and a sense of fullness in her ears and lymph nodes. The ear pain was almost immediate after vaccination. On 04Feb2021, the next day, she woke up with a headache. It was an unusual headache. It did not go away with Tylenol. Then about halfway through the day, she developed significant body aches like when she had COVID. She also experienced extreme sleepiness like when she had COVID too. She took Motrin and had to lie down during her work day. The Motrin did help. Then mid morning 04Feb2021, she got a chill. She couldn&#39;t get warm enough. She had no fever. She checked multiple times. Her temps ranged from 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021. She experienced fatigue. She did not know the seriousness for any of the side effects she experienced. As of 05Feb2021, her headache has improved. She was still experiencing sleepiness and fatigue. The chills she developed mid day. She had not them right now. She has better and worse moments just like when she had COVID. She was worried about the second one. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021, COVID-19: positive in Dec2020. No other relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and sleepiness. A Product Complaint was filed.

A 61-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL1284; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 06Jan2021 07:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunization, administered at hospital. Medical history included pacemaker for bradycardia w/syncopal episodes; and allergy to poppy seeds and pineapple. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), colecalciferol (VIT D3), and an unspecified multivitamin (other medications received within two weeks of vaccination). No other vaccines received within four weeks prior to covid vaccine. The patient previously took morphine and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested with covid-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced metallic taste in her mouth approximately one minute after receiving the vaccine on 06Jan2021 07:15; it lingered for about six hours (13:15). The event was reported non-serious. The patient did not receive treatment for this event. The outcome of the event was recovered on 06Jan2021 13:15.

I also started feeling lightheaded like I might faint. I pull over into a parking lot and had a family member come get me to drive me home. I was extremely thirsty and drank a lot of water at home. Eventually, my redness went away and my face did not feel as hot.  I did feel other more typical symptoms too such as painful arm, and flu like symptoms. I am mainly concerned about the reaction I had when driving home since it was similar to what happens when I take cortisone or Doxycycline.  I am needing information as to whether it is safe for me to take my second dose of the covid vaccine.

Began to develop difficulty swallowing by the time I reached my car.  Waited a few minutes and it did not abate and continued worsen,. Went to hospital&#39;s ER and was seen by Dr. At that time, my voice had become coarse and gravely. Was given oral steroid and a Benadryl.  Symptoms lessened a bit and were gone after about 2 hours. While at first I thought my breathing wasn&#39;t affected, after symptoms cleared, I realized that my breathing was easier. Symptoms did not reoccur.

At 1208 on 1/20/2021 pt received 2nd dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine. Immediately after vaccination, pt experienced unusual taste in mouth, flushing, and feeling of heat in chest.  At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips. Pt communicated with Dr advised to stay under observation, but transfer to ED not medically necessary. At 1415, pt was advised to go home with supervision of partner and monitor symptoms from there.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

I left the center after 15 minutes and came back to Pediatric office where I work.  I did take a Zyrtec and felt completely better after approx. an hour.  After the 2nd dose I did mention I had felt odd after 1st dose and decided to sit for 30 min.  I felt about the same as I did after the 1st dose so I left.  when  I got to my car my face was flushed.  I was not tachycardia just a very odd felling in my head and then my tongue did start to itch (or feel funny)  .  I took a Zyrtec and went home.  I never had any swelling of lips or tongue, no trouble breathing.  Pulse stayed constant around 80.  This time the symptoms lasted approx. 4 hours.  I I did continue to take Zyrtec for 3 days after injection.

The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A contactable consumer reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 report.   A 61-year-old female consumer (patient) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Covid Vaccine, lot number: EL1248) on 06Jan2021 at single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant drug included Multivitamin, Vitamin C, Vitamin D Zinc all from Mar2020 and ongoing. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EK5730) on 18Dec2020 in the right arm. Patient got COVID vaccine and a few hours later or the next day she started getting a hole in her retina and started losing her site in right eye. she went to the doctor as she has a hole in her retina. Again, this may be totally unrelated but she wanted to call and get this reported. She is going to see a retinal specialist this afternoon. After she had her COVID vaccine she had a bad headache for 3 days. She wore sunglasses in her house because the light bothered her eyes. She noticed this on 16Jan2021 because she was looking at paperwork and her eyes felt dry. She blinked a few times and had opened one eye alone, and she noticed that her left eye was fine but the vision in her right was not. This could have been going on longer. She just never closes only one eye. When both are open, her vision is normal. She saw the eye doctor yesterday, and that is when they said she had a hole in her retina. They said she will have to have surgery to close the hole. She knows she is at the right age for this to spontaneously happen, but just in case it is related, she wanted to report it. Outcome of the event Loss of vision in right eye was Not Recovered, for headache was recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

Next day, the tingling continued and felt more burning sensation but never severe.   However, did contact my primary care provider and they suggested that I take Benadryl to help it.   I took it for several days and the tingling/burning feeling stopped completely after about 10 days.      I did not have any swelling of lips or tongue but just the tingling/burning sensation.

                                                almost like she also had some mild hearing loss; nausea; exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus/ headaches/migraines; exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus; exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus/ increased tinnitus; some abdominal tightness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient herself) via Medical Information team.  A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took a Benadryl (25mg oral tablet) and my roommate drove me to the Emergency Room. That area of my face continued to swell and impacted my lower lip as well. My lips were numb and tingling and I could feel my cheek swell more inside my mouth as it was touching my teeth. I was monitored (vital signs and pulse ox) for 90 minutes and received 20 mg of pepcid oral tablet and 10 mg dexamethasone oral tablet- both 1x only.

                                                Rapid heartbeat, flushing, tingling of whole body like an adrenaline rush, felt like my blood was on fire. Hoarse voice and constant clearing of throat due to production of phlegm in throat. Tingling lips and tongue. This continued all day until I took 10 mg of prednisone. Within 3 hours, all symptoms were gone. Slept well all night. The next day (Wednesday) I felt fine. Slept fine Wednesday night. Thursday morning, all of the above symptoms returned.  I took 5 mg prednisone, which didn?t alleviate symptoms so I took an additional 5 mg.  I also took 2 Benadryl. Symptoms went away. Slept well Thursday night. Friday morning they returned. I had a doctor?s appointment scheduled (new patient visit) which I canceled as the office told me to go to the ER at the hospital where I got my shot.  By the time I got to the ER, my symptoms had subsided. The ER doctor gave me 60 mg of prednisone, 1 famotidine, Benadryl.

I was told to get a covid test which I did Saturday morning.  I received the results of negative on Sunday the 6th.  Today is the 10th, one week after the vaccine, and still no taste. I met by phone with my Dr. , and she said to report it as a side effect to the vaccine.

                                                I am on infusion for severe psoriatic arthritis, and was doing well. Two days after injection it was as if the effects of my infusions were cancelled. Extreme widespread stiffness, pain, joint swelling and heat, muscle weakness and pain. I also had swollen lower lip and have had an increase in headaches and nausea. Two weeks after the injection I awoke with my right arm swollen, hard, and itchy. The arm and my lips have resolved, but I am still having all the other problems. I have reported these symptoms to both my primary doctor and my rheumatologist.

Residual numbness to  left face/head intermittently. including today more noticeable March 22, 2021.

I was out of work for 2 weeks and returned to work on 1/25/21. I got an infusion on 1/20 so I can&#39;t get my 2nd dose until 90 days after that date.

I left the clinic and got in the car to drive home and felt a weird feeling in my throat reminiscent of my esophageal spasm and then it felt like someone had their hand on my throat squeezing my throat and felt like I needed to take deep breaths to expand my lungs. Within a minute or two at most, my lips, tip of my tongue, tip of my nose and face beside my lips and under my cheeks started to tingle and go numb.  My insides felt swollen.   I had a doctors appointment and went there after picking my son up at home.  I reported my feeling to my doctor who prescribed a steroid for 3 days and told me to also take Benadryl or Claritin, which I did. However, today is day 4 after my vaccine and today is the first day my insides don?t hurt.

(This was occurring while I was driving myself home from the vaccination site.)  I administered my Epipen.  And I then drove myself to the Emergency Room, which is near my home.  At the ER, I was injected with cortisone, Benadryl, and Pepcid, and had my heart and blood pressure monitored for about 3 hours and then I was released, with a prescription for 50MG Prednisone (1q/day) and 10MG Pepcid (2q/day) x 5 days (for both scripts).  I finished the prescriptions, but am still feeling some discomfort in my throat and some dizziness.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

                                                Between 10 and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt like someone had thumped me in the chest over my left breast. I tried to breathe deeply, and I started to feel light headed. I didn&#39;t tell anyone, I was let go after 15 minutes. I sat in my car about 5 minutes and then decided I was worse. I was weak and shaky and light headed, my top lip was fuzzy feeling. I didn&#39;t feel like there was a blockage in my airway but I felt like I was having trouble getting my rib cage to expand so I could breathe. I went back in and was sat down, I was evaluated. Paramedics were called, by time they came I was lightheaded and I was foggy brained. I couldn&#39;t respond easily. My BP was 165/99 and my heart rate was 98. my O2 was fine but by that time I felt like I had to work hard to get a deep breath. I was feeling worse quickly. I was taken to the ER in a wheelchair. I was put in a bed and hooked me up to monitors. I was left alone for a while. When the dr came in he checked me out and listen to my lungs. I had a hard time getting my lungs to expand. Doctor ordered a blood sugar test and it was below 100. Chest x-ray, EKG and blood work. He told me later that everything was normal. I was there for 2 hours before I felt like I could go home. I didn&#39;t receive any medication. I was able to breathe easier by time I left the hospital. I was thinking more clearly as well. The next day I was still feeling shaky and weak. I went to my PCP on friday and I was feeling normal by then.

The headache lessened &amp; the ear buzzing went down a little bit, but ear buzzing is still pretty loud. The loud ear buzzing has not gotten any better 23 days later!!! My ears are still buzzing now.   I am wondering will my 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine due on 04/01/2021 make my ear buzzing worse?

                                                Approximately 25 minutes after receiving the vaccine I noticed my eyes were beginning to itch and my throat felt odd and was accompanied by a hoarse voice.  I was driving home at that point and considered turning back for medical advice (should have but did not).  Over the next few hours itching sensation on my tongue, face including eyes, head and back.  Developed just one hive on my eyebrow approx 3 hours after vaccination, and one on my thigh at least six hours after vaccination.  The symptoms were not severe but obviously I monitored them.  Now 24 hours after the vaccination and still have some itching as described above.  Throat is somewhat better.  Eyes feel odd more than itchy at this point.

She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn&#39;t as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn&#39;t as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn&#39;t even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn&#39;t know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn&#39;t get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that&#39;s happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There&#39;s pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn&#39;t. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that&#39;s weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced. The patient recovered from breath sounds abnormal and constipation on 12Mar2021; cardiospasm, chills and vaccination site pain in Mar2021 while the remaining events were unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Mar2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing celiac disease diagnosed in 2012 and has been gluten free ever since, allergies, and anxiety. Concomitant medications included zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) taken for sleep; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for allergies; alprazolam (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for anxiety; vitamin d nos (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for immune system health; and magnesium (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for health. The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (Lot number: EN6203) at 61 years of age on 26Feb2021 between 5:15PM and 5:30PM in the left arm at a single dose for covid-19 immunization and the flu vaccine (INFLUENZA) for immunization 15 years ago and experienced arm was sore. There were no other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 19Mar2021, the patient experienced sore arm. On 21Mar2021, the patient experienced a little off, fatigue, brain fog, a little tired. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, vomited, horrible spinning, generalized weakness. In 2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t open her eyes, couldn&#39;t eat, nystagmus, could not walk at all without help. On an unknown date, the patient experienced dizzy. The events, severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, vomited, and horrible spinning, required emergency room and physician office (video) visits. The patient was hospitalized for severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, vomited, and horrible spinning from 31Mar2021 to 02Apr2021. The clinical course was as follows: the patient received the second dose on 19Mar2021 and she didn&#39;t really have any bad side effects, a sore arm, and a little tired on the second day, maybe a little off but was fine. 12 days later she was vacuuming and had severe vertigo, she was down on the floor, just horrible spinning, horrible nausea and laid on floor and vomited all day. Her doctor told her to go to the ER. They did all kinds of tests with unknown results on an unknown date and she could not open her eyes for 2 days, she was so violently spinning with vertigo, they gave her fluids. She went in on Wednesday and by Friday she was a little better, she could open her eyes, still had spinning and vertigo. It was like nystagmus, her eyes were, she just really couldn&#39;t open her eyes for the doctor, had generalized weakness and couldn&#39;t walk at all without help in the hospital. The only time she moved from one position was to go to the bathroom with assistance. In the ER, she could not get up out of bed the first night they were trying all ways of catharizing her. She could not even get out of the bed with the help, they had to carry her to the CAT scan with negative result on 31Mar2021. She had slightly improved but still had vertigo and she was not vomiting anymore, that was only the first couple days. She was sent home with medications for dizziness and nausea but they didn&#39;t do anything. Two weeks later she was still dizzy, had vertigo, it was way better than it was, she can open the windows a little bit but she was basically in a dark room for like the first week and a half. Not violent like it was the first couple of days. The events were further described as: she was a little sore on 19Mar2021, 20Mar2021, 21Mar2021, and maybe the 22Mar2021 her arm was still sore. She clarified the sore arm pretty much ended on the 22Mar2021. She was surprised she felt fine on 19Mar2021 and 20Mar2021 and on the evening of 21Mar2021, in the middle of the night between 20Mar2021 and 21Mar2021 she felt a little off and a little more tired. On 21Mar2021, she didn&#39;t feel great, fatigued and brain fog but was fine after that. She began feeling a little off and a little tired early morning on the 21Mar2021. That was pretty much gone by the 22Mar2021. The feeling tired and a little off and the brain fog and fatigue went away 22Mar2021. She vomited constantly, started suddenly and violently and was incapable of moving, all she did was vomit and lay on the floor. It was a complete 360, she was fine vacuuming a minute before and then suddenly got dizzy and went down and could never get up. She had to be taken from upstairs in her house and transported to the hospital. She was not really experiencing the nausea now, she was not completely herself but she can eat, she couldn&#39;t eat for the first couple of days and was on IV fluids and once she got out of the hospital was able to eat a little and now eating almost normally. It took a week to eat normally and she couldn&#39;t eat holiday dinner on 04Apr2021. From 31Mar2021 to 10Apr2021, every day the nausea has slightly been improving. She was not quite herself and still has vertigo and was making herself eat her meals. She vomited 30 times and in the hospital they gave her an IV to stop that and never vomited in hospital, maybe once in the ER. She confirmed the 31Mar2021 was the last time she vomited. She had not recovered completely from nausea. She used be running around all the time, she would walk 10 miles per week to exercise, yesterday she had a mammogram scheduled and she was just so wiped out for doing something for the first time and had to lie down for the whole rest of the day. She was hospitalized from 31Mar2021 until the evening of 02Apr2021 when they let her out. She was given medication for nausea and dizziness didn&#39;t do anything. She was given ondasetron (ZOFRAN), 4 mg and meclizine. Because of her weakness, the patient was checked to see if there was any brain bleed or brain stem problems that would explain the vertigo and did not find anything. The tests were negative for any brain problems on an unknown date. Lab data included: blood levels: low on vitamin d (probably because she was not absorbing nutrients as well) on an unknown date, endoscopy: unknown results on an unknown date, and MRI: negative on 01Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, horrible spinning, vomited, and dizzy. The clinical outcome of the events, severe vertigo, nausea, generalized weakness, could not open her eyes, nystagmus, could not walk at all without help, was recovering. The clinical outcome of the events, fall down on the floor, horrible spinning, dizzy, was unknown. The clinical outcome of the events, a little off, fatigue, sore arm, brain fog, and a little tired, was recovered on 22Mar2021. The clinical outcome of the event, vomited, was recovered on 31Mar2021. The clinical outcome of the event, could not eat, was recovered in 2021.    No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 22Apr2021 12:10 (at the age of 61-year-old) as unknown single for COVID-19 immunization. This report was not related to a study or programme. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was first time had flu shot made her very ill, next year doctor suggested she should just have half of a shot instead of full shot to see if she tolerated it and she was able to tolerate that. She had not any other problems with flu vaccines in general. Some of the other vaccines, she was just supposed to take Benadryl with them because of some of the filler ingredients people put in things. She had previously had the 1 dose shingles vaccine, but she had gotten probably shingles probably a couple of months after that so they encouraged her to get the 2 part shingles vaccine at a later date and told her to do the pre-medicate routine like Benadryl day before, day of and at least 2 days after shingles vaccine doses and if any major problems call for help. She did not have a noticeable problem from the 2 part shingles vaccine. Some of the times depends on what filler ingredients people use. She was allergic to nutmeg which was used as an emollient oil or it&#39;s called Myristicin something or other oil; if something has too high a dose of mannitol it can cause a problem. She has a very long list of allergies and high sensitivities; if it was a high enough sensitivity it goes in allergies list, even though it may not be a true allergy. Family has lots of allergies. Regarding prescribed indication additional details: She had 3 doctors who initially advised her to get the vaccine including her primary care physician, oncologist and haematologist; this was because she was a high risk person because of various health issues. Her haematologist 2-3 months ago when she had her last appointment with him he was saying to get the shot and prescribed the epi-pen at that time; no one was having it yet, but he expected she would have some sort of reaction to it not able to be covered by Benadryl alone. Medical history included ongoing platelet disorder Verbatim: Unidentified platelet disorder, Lots of allergies, cardiac murmur, ongoing asthma, osteoarthritis, glucose tolerance impaired, hypoglycaemia slow thyroid and back and neck pain. Concomitant medication(s) included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for hypersensitivity (50mg taken as needed), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for hypersensitivity (10mg daily), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma (250/50 twice daily), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism (137mcg-1 tablet daily), methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) (20mg tablet twice daily), salsalate, colestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT) (2-500mg tablets 3 times daily), sucralfate (CARAFATE) (1mg tablet 4 times daily-dosage verified with caller as milligrams and captured as provided), loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]) (2.5/0.25 takes 2 tablets of that 4 times daily), calcium carbonate (CALCIUM OYSTER SHELL [CALCIUM CARBONATE]) (Alternates dose of 500mg and 1000mg on days takes Vitamin D), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) (250 mg), vitamin D (50,000 units every other day taken), vitamin B12 (1mg injection every 14 days), clonazepam (KLONOPIN) (2-1mg tablets at bedtime), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma (10mg tablets at bedtime) and cefixime (FLEXERIL [CEFIXIME]) taken for back pain, neck pain (10mg tablets 3 times daily as needed). On 22Apr2021, Onset time: She had a note saying her eyes itchy at 12:20, but they were itching before that because she waited long enough to report it; so onset time was less than 10 minutes when her eyes started itching. Then her pulse; she could feel chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard. They did check her pulse while she was in their initial observation and her pulse was only in the 70s, but oxygenation was at 96%.When at doctors office less than 1 hour before that reading, oxygenation was at 98%.Recorded at 12:30 eyes itching much worse, throat felt like it was starting to tighten, heart felt like it was starting to race. By 12:50 hands were starting to swell. She had already been pre-medicated with Benadryl before this before she went down to get the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, she had Benadryl in her system. She had that same morning with her morning meds had taken Zyrtec and Benadryl in anticipation of getting the possibility of getting the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine because she has to pre-medicate for vaccines just in case she starts to react in anyway. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines was not administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Emergency Room taken from the location where vaccine administered-they gave her Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot had her sit for basic observation then sit for extended observation. In that time period telling them her symptoms were going on, increasing. They gave her another 50mg Benadryl even though she had already had 1 before and then called emergency room, took her down, left her in waiting area even though she had heart and chest palpitations. Physician Office seen prior to event on 20Apr2021, seen after event 27Apr2021. Primary Care Physician didn&#39;t hear anything in lungs either visit. Not admitted to hospital; seen in emergency room, theoretically she got treated; however her basic blood pressure and stuff even with what they were doing was higher than when she was triaged in the ER; blood pressure was up and something else,oxygenation level moderately reduced from when she came down to when she was just let go; however her symptoms were worse when she was leaving than when she got there. She knows what they gave her while she was there was IV of normal saline, solumedrol and IV Benadryl. Thinks they later gave her Tylenol tablets. Finally got them to do an EKG because kept saying her chest was getting worse but that was several hours after she was back there even though came there having chest pains. In her opinion this hospital was not taking reaction seriously. Not admitted to hospital even though symptoms were worse and blood pressure higher on discharge, well above her normal levels. Currently trying to get them to explain why they took so long to do anything for her. Finally did a chest x-ray on 22Apr2021:discharge papers say abnormal x-ray and they gave a couple of different possibilities as to what that might be so Primary Care Physician wrote a prescription to get a follow-up chest x-ray to make sure that everything is fine and back to normal and not ongoing or progressing or anything because they gave some strange things: what their impressions were: findings: there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. It says the left lung appears clear; cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits; impression restates non specific right findings there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. This was from front and lateral views of the chest x-ray at 19:00pm 22Apr2021. 2 ECGs: She guesses this is what they call EKG not, relevant point is that in the notes there for the records: Says abnormal ECG compared with blah blah blah, hard to find when exactly they wrote this, trying to get the exact wording for each of the two. Machine results CED, which caller explained is what they call themselves now instead of ER, notes for MD interpretation; one done at 17:53 , other at 21:32. They both say there was slightly different readings, however both say abnormal ECG. One of the wordings that is in both. She had no further details to provide regarding relevant testing/investigations. She had to be in the ER back in the room for several hours before they would do the EKG and that&#39;s only because she said I have chest pain and standard procedure is to do an EKG, had been back there for hours, they had done no tests, the only thing they did was basic blood panel, had not done a troponin or heart enzymes test, had not done EKG that&#39;s why she knows they were not taking her seriously at all; if someone says chest pains and you don&#39;t do anything in the standard protocol they are not taking you seriously. On this Monday, 2 days ago she had gone down to pick up the records from the ER to go to Primary Care Physician appointment 27Apr2021, finally actually got to speak to someone who said they would get back to her on 27Apr2021 to look into why the EKG tests were not done for someone having chest pains. That&#39;s one of the first things you do for someone having chest pain, no matter what the source. Frustrated with them because they&#39;re still not communicating back, they had not taken her seriously while she was there; unknown if they were actually going to be reporting, as they were still trying to convince her to get the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. If she reacted to the first dose in first 10 minutes, second dose could be much more of a reaction. With the amount of anti-histamines in her system with Benadryl and Zyrtec and she was still starting to react in under 10 minutes. It&#39;s possible to be one of the inactive ingredients but she doesn&#39;t see anything in the pamphlet provided that she could identify at first glance as being the culprit to the problem other than 2 possibilities: potassium chloride and other is monobasic potassium phosphate. There is a possibility of her having a reaction to those because she was known to react to certain potassium products; sometimes it was the inactive ingredients. She definitely would have wanted to get the second part of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine series until after she was not getting the medical attention she needed after reaction to the first dose. Because ideally you&#39;re supposed to have it at the same location, that just made her very nervous at the prospect of worse reaction at location that did not take her serious the first time. She was a big fan of Pfizer thought they do a great job; she had not known it was a 2 parter, not that it should make much difference. When her Primary Care Physician was saying second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was out of the question and she had been saying to people that she did not think it would be prudent to take the second part, they kept trying to say oh you need to get the second part, talk to so and so so they can convince you to get it, and doctor is going no. She reacted to ringers lactate or lactated ringers whatever the name is, her retired nurse sister sat and watched her getting some ringers lactate prior to surgery for her tear duct and saw her starting to break out in red splotches, patient said she was itching. Action taken in response to the events was drug withdrawn. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

                                                Almost immediately after the injection, I noticed a metallic taste. It was mild enough that it did not interfere with the taste of foods or drinks. It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

                                                experience funny taste in her mouth (somewhat metallic like); This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing disability and gait disturbance (difficulty ambulating long distances due to being disabled). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. During the patient&#39;s 15-minute waiting period after the vaccination, the patient began to experience funny taste in her mouth (somewhat metallic like). Treatment included antihistamines (unspecified). The response to treatment was good. The patient was doing well upon discharge/leaving. She was escorted out via wheelchair only due difficulty ambulating long distances due to being disabled but is otherwise at baseline. The outcome of the event was recovering (reported as &#34;reports some improvement in change in taste prior to discharge/leaving&#34;). The reporter assessed this case as non-serious.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

EMTs were called but I didn&#39;t go to the hospital.  My son picked me up and took me home because I was unable to drive.  On the way I experienced loss of vision and speech for about 5 minutes.  When I got home, my legs were so shaky that I had to have help walking.  I started getting severe chills that took 3 hours to get warm (2 heavy blankets, space heater, and heating pad).  I was very fatigued and felt bad the rest of the day.  (Saturday)The next day I had flu-like symptoms; headache, joint aches, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue.  Sunday was better but still had to rest most of the day because when I would stay up for over 30 minutes, the symptoms would return.  Monday-  stomach cramps, headache, fatigue  but went to work (30 minutes late due to stomach) and left 30 minutes early.

                                                I had to get cleared by a allergist prior to getting the vaccine due to my prior history allergy history. I was advised by the allergist to take Allegra an hour before receiving the vaccine. About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I started to throat my started to feel dry and tickling, it felt like it swelling starting from the left side to the center, I started having difficulties swallowing my salvia and any fluid. My blood pressure was checked and it was elevated.  I started to have difficulty breathing. They transferred me over to the ER. They gave me IV medicines Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid (I think). After 6 hours I was able to go home. Everything went back to normal besides the pain in the left arm at injection site.   I had a telemedicine visit today with my primary care physician to follow up.

As time went on pain worsened and radiated into my cheek, left eye and left ear.  ~ One week later, I saw a dentist; he couldn&#39;t say whether it was TMJ or tooth problem, so sent me home w/quick splint to separate my top &amp; bottom teeth at night and some exercises.  These didn&#39;t help, so ~ a week after that, he gave  me antibiotic.  No improvement in symptoms until ~ a week after that.  I saw pcp, as it felt like something was crawling inside my left ear.  Ears were fine; she agreed w/inconclusive answer of dentist - at this point, there was some improvement in my symptoms.  She suggested prescription-strength Naproxen for 10 days, which I did.  the pain/ache has been mostly gone since completing the Naproxen.  For last few weeks, I&#39;ve been back to normal - no ache/pain/strange sensations in ear at all.

This 62 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3246) on 19Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 62 years old), in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) or on the same day: none. Medical history included ongoing trigeminal neuralgia (she had nerve issues, clarifying she was diagnosed about 6-1/2 years ago with trigeminal neuralgia that caused right-sided pain in her head and in her right ear), Raynaud&#39;s in her hands and feet since she was a kid. The patient previously took a 7-day course of levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and after that she had a diagnosis of ongoing erythromelalgia in her hands and feet and permanent ringing in ears, both since 2014, after she took, saying she functioned fine with the permanent ringing in her ears, she had gotten used it. She also felt horrible and had a muscle tear in her right arm a week after taking Levaquin. Concomitant medication included nortriptyline 20 mg capsule once daily (at night), ongoing since about 6-1/2 years ago, for trigeminal neuralgia. On 19Jan2021, 3 hours after vaccination, the patient experienced itching on the left side of her tongue. On the same day she had a little bit of swelling on the left side of her tongue. She took 1 generic 25 mg tablet of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) at 19:30 and was okay and slept fine. The next day it felt different but it wasn&#39;t itching. She had other autoimmune type things going on. Since an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient had been having more ear pain and usually took medicine for this but had not had ear pain in awhile. The patient said the left side of her tongue itching and swelling was enough to make her concerned. She also said she was concerned that there may be something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will activate her nerve issue since her right ear had been hurting her since Feb2021. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather was causing her right ear pain, but she had been on medication for over 6 years now that had been taking care of her right ear pain. She said she did not want to have the second COVID-19 vaccine injection if it was going to set off her nerve issue. She stated the doctors were thinking that she should get it but staying there and be monitored and not get it on her day off. She would be getting it at the student health center where she worked so she could be monitored and would have access to medical treatment if needed. Relevant tests: none. The events did not require ER visit or physician office visit. Itching on the left side of her tongue resolved on 19Feb2021. Swelling of tongue resolved on 20Feb2021. The other events outcome was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  autoimmune disorder and other events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including autoimmune panel, ANA and ESR, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Able to reduce fever with ice packs but fever returned after 8 hours.  Had fever from 2/12/21 to 2/18/21.  Headache persisted and did not resolve until 2/22/21.  Poor appetite and ackward taste in mouth.  On 2/16/21, had Rapid Antigen Covid test, results NEGATIVE.  Thought symptoms may have been sinus infection, but usual remedies not effective.  Headache was like nothing ever experienced before.  Symptoms felt very different.  Had Covid test on 1/25/21 prior to 2nd vaccination, NEGATIVE.  Self isolated after vaccination and worked from home so low risk of exposure.  Was not tested for influenza.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

                                                Patient has allergies to several medications and keeps epipen on hand with her always. Was asked to sit for 30  minutes after vaccine. At minute 27 she started getting swelling and redness of her lips and face slightly. She normally takes Benadryl when this happens so gave her a Benadryl 50mg one dose. Her throat then became tight in a few minutes and she said that she needed an epipen because she was starting to have a little bit of trouble breathing. Gave epipen and her symptoms resolved within a few minutes. Kept her for 15 minutes. She stated that she knew she would be ok and asked if she could leave. I stated she needed to see the ER if she had any more trouble. I also consulted with her to check with her doctor about getting the 2nd dose because more than likely it&#39;s not recommended.

This consumer (patient) reported that a 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 62-years, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hadn&#39;t had her period for 8 years. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historically received first single dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 62-years for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine last Friday 19Feb2021, when she was driving home her eyes was runny, sort of hurting like salt in her eye, it was like that all evening she had to put a patch on her eye to help it. That same evening may arm was hurting where she got the vaccine in the right arm, and the lymph node under her arm got inflamed. The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body. Consumer added that she read on line that patients should wait for 5months before going to their doctor about the swollen lymph nodes because they might send the person for a test, mammogram and it may say they have cancer, in the clinical trials apparently some patients has issues with their lymph nodes and when they did testing it was found they had cancer, but it was not cancer it was the vaccine. Outcome of the event she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed was recovered/resolved in Feb2021; of the armpit swelling was not recovered/not resolved; while of remain was unknown.  Information on lot/batch has been requested.

I still have some chest heaviness and still having asthma issues which includes coughing.  I also had side effects of sore arm, chills, fatigue.  Did not seek treatment.  I had no idea how long this would last.  I wish I would have read the paperwork for severe allergic reaction, but I didn&#39;t. I would have gone to the ER.  I have suffered with this since Saturday.

I had aches and pain all over, itchiness, headache, joint pain over the next week. Around the 22nd, it stopped. It took almost 10 days for me to feel somewhat normal.

Very tired . Tired enough that I accidentally  left the house for a job interview wearing one white sock and one black sock. Which isn&#39;t normal for me. 3rd day: muscle aches. 4th days feels like a really mild virus.   This is not me but another person from  my former job said she had spontaneous canker sores from the Pfizer shot.

This consumer reported same event for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL3302, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 04Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient has no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 04Feb2021. This morning (12Feb2021), she found out she has no sense of smell. Patient who no longer has a sense of smell noticed it a little while ago, about 9 AM. The reporter wanted to know since the patient had the vaccine if this would cause testing to come back positive. The outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021196187 same reporter/drug/AE, different patient

Medics responded, as we were talking, realized numbness had followed the trigeminal nerve back to the ear, and then from the ear, toward the nose. we determined it was not life threatening, and I was asked to contact my healthcare provider. Left lower quandrant of cheek/face was swollen for between 24 - 36 hours. Developed diarrhea 24 hours after injection.

I was polite and took a few bites.  Went to bed @ 10 pm.  The next morning I woke in the fetal position and COULD NOT MOVE!  Called husband for help.  He lifted me to the sit up position by my rib cage.  Very difficult to move for 4 days.  Had Gammagard treatment on March 16. 2021.  That was a mistake, I guess.  I could not even think clearly enough to try to fill out this form.

                                                On 3/25 I had a sore arm with firmness around the injection site.  Today I woke up very early with fever and chills and feeling pretty ill.  Urinated and crawled into bed and put electric blanket on high until I felt warm. Got up about 7:00 and took my temperature  and it was about 100.  Then it varied between 99 and 102.5 all day. Had blurred vision and body aches and bad headache and nausea. .Took Tylenol or hydrocodone which helped with keeping temp closer to 100 but I?d fall asleep and forget to take Tylenol and it would go back to 102. I didn?t have anyone to drive me that I felt comfortable enough to risk exposure in case it was an actual illness and not the vaccine. I considered calling an ambulance but decided to wait and see if I could get my temp under control. This evening I?m  at 100 again (I just took it again) but thought my fever had broken as I didn?t feel I was radiating heat like I felt when it was 102. My normal temp is usually around 97. I haven?t taken anything Tylenol or hydrocodone since about 3:00 but I will take just plain Tylenol now.

A 62-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN8203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 04Mar2021, reports getting the vaccine on 04Mar2021 and has had a large cyst on the left side of her jaw, sore right jaw with clicking sounds and tingling on the left leg, an hour and a half after. Also reported difficulty swallowing. Reported that she had reactions, not immediately, but 1 hour and 15 minutes after the vaccine. Caller reports a large dime size knot on the left side of jaw, right at temporo mandibular joint (TMJ) area. Injection was on left side. Caller reported that minutes later, her jaw got very sore like it started popping out of joint, and couldn&#39;t open wide. She also states that she had tingling down the left leg, down to the toes, left leg only. States this all happen pretty much right at the same time, maybe 5-10 minutes of each thing happening. She is at home with grandson. She was on hold for a while already. Weird reactions, not the common ones. States that she is not going to take the second vaccine, is afraid to take it. At this point, it is just a hard knot (described as a large dime size knot), and he (the doctor) said to take a Benadryl, which she did. Knot, hardness resolved gone by 06Mar2021, but a pimple remained for 7 days. The outcome of the event jaw disorder, jaw pain, was recovered on an unspecified date, for the event tingling of extremity was recovered on 04Mar2021, for the event large dime size knot on the left side of jaw, right at TMJ area;hardness  was recovered on 06Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.   No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected. Batch/lot number already provided; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the close temporal association (reportedly, the reactions occurred  hour and 15 minutes after the vaccine), a causal association between the reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be  excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 62-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration administered on right arm on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 62-year-old) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization.

Family Medical History Relevant to AE reported as None.  History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect reported as Both doses of product documented in Pfizer Suspect Vaccine and Vaccination fields. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect reported as None. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207; Expiry date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration to the right arm on 13Mar2021 at 13:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine other than dose 1 of 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions patient reported none other than just her inhalers which doses of had to be increased in response to symptoms after first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Concomitant medication included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) taken as Dose increased to twice in the morning daily for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing, (Lot number: 0014678, ; Expiration Date: Jan20230); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) 500 taken as Dose increased from once daily to twice daily an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride (Lot Number: 3N2E, Expiration Date: Feb2022), fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing (Lot number: GA00510, Expiration date: May2022); prednisone (PREDNISONE) taken for an unspecified indication with quantity of 27, Dose: 3-20mg daily for 7 days, then 2-20mg daily for 2 days, then 1-20mg daily for 3 days and Ongoing therapy. She also used a nose spray that didn&#39;t work so they switched her back to Dymista nose spray.   Consumer stated that she received both doses of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had reactions to both of them. Consumer stated that, &#34;The second dose was even worse. They put her on Prednisone. She did not know if she should be tested again or not? She was sitting up but she could not walk around anywhere. She had 2 broken knees. She could not walk anywhere. After the second dose, they had to bring her to the hospital because she couldn&#39;t even walk to her car. She got home and she had been sick ever since. She had allergies too. She could not do anything. she had a hard time breathing. she was hesitant to get the 2nd one, but everybody said to get it. Her IgG level was down to 300 something. She was also tapering off of prednisone and she did not want to be tapering off it because it was worked well for her. She could tell by her breathing that it was helped her. She could taste sodium in her mouth constantly since she had got the vaccination.&#34; Second dose completed her prescribed therapy. Dates for Symptoms From 15Mar2021 to Ongoing Reported seriousness for Symptoms reported as Unspecified and the Symptoms was reported as worsened. Patient&#39;s doctor dropped her last week, told her she didn&#39;t know what to do with her, and that this was too stressful.  Onset of symptoms following first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine was on 17Mar2021. She couldn&#39;t breathe very well when she went in for the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She was ok the first day after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, seemed ok, arm didn&#39;t hurt; but then had onset of symptoms. She has been in bed the whole time since onset of symptoms, was in bed for over 2 weeks. She slept for 2 days straight, only got up for water and the bathroom. It was bad, getting hard to breathe. She had to use her emergency inhaler. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine messed up her Meniere&#39;s disease. Doctor started patient on Prednisone for these symptoms, and Prednisone is really the only thing that clears up Meniere&#39;s disease because her ears was full and she could not get up. Prednisone helped her and I relayed in her &#39;rescue&#39; inhalers (treatment) because she did 2 in the morning, two inhalers anyway when she started to feel better, she got her second one and it made her worst.  She did not eat anything salty or anything, the barometric pressure was not bad. It was really funny because she had just finished everything and it was a few days before she had to go get her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine shot. She was just starting to feel normal, at least normal for her, she could get up normal and drive. They gave her the second shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and it was like a double. She clarified as she got like double the amount of symptoms that she had experienced following the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  She is tasting sodium in her mouth from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She can&#39;t have much sodium which struck up the Meniere&#39;s disease really bad the second day after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine; her allergies in her head went bonkers. She could not talk, it was closing up her throat, she was coughing every time she eats or dinks, and she&#39;s having a &#34;really bad&#34; adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the second dose. They had to take her out of the hospital to her car in a wheelchair &#34;right after&#34; getting the second shot. She could not get more than 1000 mg of sodium a day, she tastes it in her mouth constantly, she could not get rid of it and it was &#34;going through her system&#34;. She wanted to know what to do, since her doctor told her to contact Pfizer. She wanted to know what part of the vaccine is doing that, she assures it is sodium, because sodium is in her mouth 24/7 and she could not get it out, she could not have that much sodium in her body. It was still getting really hard to breathe. She is still taking the Prednisone she was initially prescribed and started on for the symptoms that started after her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She is tapering off of Prednisone, and she shouldn&#39;t be tapering off, she thinks she needs to be Prednisone for some more days, maybe 3 more days, then she would be ok. It was prescribed as a 7-day burst of Prednisone. She mentioned that the only Prednisone that works on her is the Actavis manufactured Prednisone; her pharmacy orders it for her because they know that. She called the emergency room Saturday when she was really bad. They said they had a line there and it was going to be at least a 4 hour wait. With patient&#39;s low immune system, Meniere&#39;s disease and that she could hardly breathe she did not go to the emergency room because she could catch something and die while waiting. She decided she would just stay at home and rest. She has not had any Physician&#39;s office visit relative to event; she has a telephone appointment tomorrow to see if the doctor is going to be her doctor. She had to cancel her appointment with the doctor today because if she has something she doesn&#39;t want to spread it, she feels worse now and with the Meniere&#39;s she is tasting sodium in her mouth constantly from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, she does not eat a lot of salt. The flu shot takes her a couple of days, then she is right back up and Vaccination Last dose on Oct2020. Consumer stated that she has &#39;Meniere&#39;s&#39; disease (History) and it made her worse. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG level: 300. Reporter stated the seriousness for the events was Unspecified. Seriousness of event Meniere&#39;s disease aggravated was medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Regarding lab data, consumer stated, No, they documented how swollen was my jaw was, I didn&#39;t know I was short of breath until I start back exercising and then I can&#39;t breath in there. Consumer stated, Well I just wanted to know how long this is going to last then because I have lost feeling in my mouth. Consumer stated, I got a vaccine back in March and I called Pfizer then because I had, my deltoid starts swelling and I had to go to the emergency room because that&#39;s what the paper says if you have facial swelling. So now my deltoid is still swelling, it will go down some and it will start swelling again, I have got numbness in my lips and my chin, dizziness and it hurts. So, I just wanted to know what you can do for that and along with that if it&#39;s normal. Consumer stated, Well I have been on hold for an hour, just to get this number, can&#39;t you just type the information in have them contact me. When tried to probe for further questions, Consumer stated, I have already documented and I just need to talk to somebody that know what to do to get my job back, like it was. Consumer stated, I went to the emergency room, the paper that they gave it to me vaccine was (name withheld), it&#39;s a drive through and they vaccinated it was the first vaccine I got, and I did not go back and get another one because I haven&#39;t recovered from that one yet. My face is out swelling up, my lips numb, my cheeks numb and numb. I am just tired and dizzy.

My lungs sounded ok so I was instructed to go home and take Benadryl.  On the way home my tongue began to swell and get a tingling sensation. My cheeks became extremely hot and had a red rash. I ended up having to take two Benadryl to get the symptoms to go away.

                                                On Friday, January 15 at approximately 6 PM while seated in a reclining chair watching television I started to develop hives below my right gluteal fold. Over the next six hours  approximately 300 hives appeared on my skin. They were very itchy. At approximately midnight my lip began to swell and being a certified registered nurse anesthetist,  who lives alone, I knew it was time to head to the ER. Prior to going to the ER  I  cleaned the lesions With alcohol, took prednisone 10 mg PO,  and applied hydrocortisone cream.    In the ER, I was given Benadryl 50 mg PO and Pepcid 20 mg and observed for one hour. The hives remained but there was no respiratory compromise. Approximately six hours later the hives were still increasing in size and number, were unbearably itchy and my swollen lips had not subsided.  I took Claritin 10 mg PO and returned to the same ER and was given Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, prednisone 20 mg po and observed for three hours. The hives did not decrease and again there was no respiratory compromise so I was sent home on prednisone And a H-1 blocker.  Of note, both my palms and lips have been bright cherry red.     I finished a five day course of Macrobid on January 13 at 10 AM.    Final diagnosis:  Alergic  reaction

A 63-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: ELD14D, via an unspecified route of administration, in left side of arm, on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included early breast cancer from 2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included tamoxifen citrate 20 mg tablet by mouth once daily from 2017 and ongoing for breast cancer (cancer pill, she has to be on it for 5 years). The patient received the vaccine as she is &#34;with fire department, thought she needed to take it, she had early breast cancer, is around lots of people&#34;. On 09Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, assessed as medically significant and in Jan2021 she experienced earache (she thought it was an earache, but it was more than that, but it made her ear hurt, and she has no infection), her mouth was drawled a little, further detailed as numbness and &#34;the eye, it is messing with it, when she is trying to see out of it, she can see, but it&#39;s blurry like&#34; and, &#34;where the ear thing is&#34;, on the back of the lymph node was real sore and her face was kind of puffy, which is the reason she went to the doctor. The patient had to go to her doctor, he told her she had a reaction to the shot, he called it Bell&#39;s Palsy, and said to let Pfizer know. Her doctor gave her something to take for mouth drawled/numbness, which is supposed to help, and she has to go back in a week.

A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176/expiration date) dose number 2 intramuscularly on 08Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. Medical history included severe allergic reaction to pecans and tinnitus. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (dose number 1, intramuscularly on the left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced tinnitus, sinus infection, and stuffy head after the first dose. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks and no other medications were taken within 2 weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. On 08Jan2021, after the 2nd dose, the patient experienced itching across shoulders/back of neck and sl nausea. She took Benadryl which relieved the itching. She went to bed and had onset of body aches, chills, and sense the she couldn&#39;t get a good breath. She felt like there was a tight band around chest. Her O2 Sat was 95% - 98%, with pulse of 101-129, T max was 101.8. The symptoms were lasting about 6 hours. In the morning, the patient took Aleve and Benadryl. Most symptoms were alleviated. She took those meds scheduled for 48 hrs. She noticed that if she tried to push past scheduled time, the itching started to return, so she just kept the meds scheduled for 48 hours. No other symptoms after that. She added that she had tinnitus, and she noticed that both injections made that worse. It was not yet subsiding since last injection. The patient also received Tylenol for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021.

                                                As I was sitting at my computer and suddenly I could barely keep my eyes open, I was so tired I couldn&#39;t lift my arms and once I closed my eyes, I could not muster the strength to open them.  I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

                                                I was okay during the 30 minute observation period, and was discharged.  Between 1 and 1:30 am, about 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up from my sleep suddenly, with an acute episode of chest tightness, cough, severe running nose and lacrimation.  I did not have hives or lip/throat itching or swelling. I felt a little warm in the face. I took Ventolin inhaler two puffs twice 30 minutes apart &#43; Aller-flo nasal sprays. I began to feel a bit better and then took Benadryl 25 mgms (because of my history of Angioedema) around 2:30 am. I feel better now, which is 12 hours after onset of episode, but had to take Ventolin inhaler this morning for a bit of chest tightness. I do not have a history of asthma, but have had seasonal allergies in past years. But if this is seasonal allergy, it is very unusual, since I have never had an acute episode like this without any early milder symptoms. And I haven&#39;t needed Ventolin in a couple of years. I am now concerned about taking the second dose.

                                                About 5:30 or so and I was going to go to lunch at work - I felt like a heartburn and I was looking for a tums. I didn&#39;t have any. I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

This consumer reported for herself that the 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Unspecified Shot), via unknown route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (to make sure because I am a caregiver). Medical history included Sjoegren&#39;s syndrome and had like chronic fatigue but &#34;that is not a real thing&#34;. Concomitant medications included buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR) and other medications that she just take a half every other day, it is a small amount. She take 5 mg every other day. She was really taking much. The consumer had lab work, may be not sure 2 to 3 weeks, she has been feeling lot of fatigue. Actually, she did do lab work, it was just like lot of blood work. The consumer stated, &#34;I am having some loss of taste and tightening in the jaw and that was immediately. Tightening is still there and the taste loss seems to happen like a day later. Tightening is on the side where the forehead is and the front like on the two sides is the pressure on the side of the head. I guess, just thinking of a headache. I guess, I had headache and crying, it is just nerve-racking.&#34; The events started from 15Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. Treatment received included Advil. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

A 63-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 around 7am in the right arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in hospital. Medical history included her hip usually bothered she, she could stand up, took a second then she could just go and put weight on it, and it would hurt the patient if she had been sitting for a long time. Family Medical History Relevant to AE was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as none. No history of all previous immunization with bnt162b2 considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL0140) on 28Dec2020 in the right arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the age of 63-year-old; first dose of shingles shot (varicella zoster vaccine) for immunization; with the second shingles shot she had a reaction, not the first, it was the varicella zoster vaccine rge (cho) (Shingrix) and was done in 2019 for immunization. It was reported that patient got her second vaccine this morning (18Jan2021) and after eating lunch she had an odd taste in her mouth. She didn&#39;t think that was a side effect but want to check and make sure. She questions whether this was a side effect or in her head. It was still going on but not as bad as it was, it might be her imagination. Patient remarked that the more she was talking the better it was getting, the odd taste in her mouth. This event was not required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Patient further reported that several hours after having her shot on 18Jan2021 she had a problem with her left hip. A while before she had a doctor told her she had arthritis on 18Jan2021 and then another doctor told her that she didn&#39;t. When her hip usually bothered she, she could stand up, took a second then she could just go and put weight on it. And it would hurt her if she had been sitting for a long time. But this time it&#39;s lasting a long time. 18Jan2021 she couldn&#39;t walk, her hip hurt so bad. It still hurts now. She could stand up, but she couldn&#39;t put weight on it. 18Jan2021 her symptoms when she ate something, she got a really weird taste in her mouth. When she ate her lunch 19Jan2021, she didn&#39;t feel quite right so she stopped eating. She came back to her food a little later and everything was fine.

The outcome of event odd taste was recovered on 19Jan2021; outcome of the other events was unknown.

Went to be early at 9:30 and awoke at one a.m.on February 26 with splitting headache.  Could not get back to sleep well and felt terrible all that  day with headache, nausea, and foggy thinking, not funcional after about 2:30 p.m.  Took Ibuprofen at 3 p.m., called doctor and went to ER at Medical Center.  Was seen at ER a few hours later.  Slept some in waiting room. Had sore throat, the worst splitting migraine type headache ever, and was extremely foggy headed, couldn&#39;t process thoughts, eyes had difficulty focusing, nausea.  My temperature was a little high for me, I am normally low and it was 99.  My blood pressure is usually low and it was 105/59, pulse was 82 and respiration was 16 with 96 % Oxygen Saturation. They did tests and had an ophthalmoligist give me an exam also.  They said I could go home with the same meds they were giving me in the hospital since they were working to alleviate my painful headache, 600 mg of ibuprofen, reglan and benadryl.  Before I left they gave me the potassium chloride. I am continuing my medications today, two days after my vaccine.

Also, around 12 hours after shot I had four hours of extreme muscle pain and shivering.  This was on my first dose.  I know it&#39;s prevalent on the 2nd dose.  I&#39;m not worried about that but am concerned with my hearing.

RPH alerted me (pharmacist rph).  I spoke with pt and asked her to describe what her tongue felt like.  She stated no pain, just felt her tongue was getting bigger.  I took her to the restroom to look at her face in the mirror.  She stated her tongue looked slightly large, but not other swelling and no difficulty breathing.  She said she feels these sxs often when shes around pets or eats certain fruits.  She denied epipen, denied call to 911.  I offered 50 mg of diphenhydramine.  She only took 25 mg of diphenhydramine. she waited another 15 mins and said she felt fine.  I advised her to go to urgent care.  She left at 6:05 PM.  I called her at 6:45 and spoke with her daughter who states her mom is doing fine but she will monitor the next few hours.  I again advised trip to ER or urgent care if any new sxs or continued tongue swelling.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

Patient denies any shortness of breath, swelling, rash, or any other respiratory issues.  Patient was monitored for 30 minutes after vaccine administration and &#34;prickly&#34; symptoms persisted.

Increased ear ringing.  Sinus and head pressure.  Slight queasiness.  When the shot was first given, I had immediate pain at the injection site and up my neck.  As the day progressed I felt tired, achy all over.  The burning, stinging pain increased, in both arms and upper back.  It seems worse at night and wakes me up.  It is severe enough that it makes me cry.  I have used regular strength Tylenol, Regular strength Advil and Allegra, as treatment.  The burning pain continues.  So does the muscle aching and fatigue.

                                                I started to experience a problem with my left eye about 6 hours after I received the vaccine. I could see small bolts of white light is the far outside corner of my eye. I first attributed it to an ocular migraine, but those usually only last maybe an hour. The next morning I could still see the bolts of light which were very distracting. I called in sick to work and went to see an eye doctor. He diagnosed me with a PVD (posterior vitreous detachment). It may have been coincidental, however since it occurred on the same day I received the first vaccine, I was advised to report it by V-safe who was doing periodic follow up through texts.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection, but then about 3 minutes after the injection, I was &#34;hit&#34; by a very intense reaction:  metallic taste in mouth, nauseous, burning heat throughout my back, sweating, very hot, very anxious/scared.  This quieted down after about 10  minutes, but then I got &#34;hit&#34; again, a few minutes after that.  This time with burning heat in my chest and then burning heat traveling down my left arm, sweating, very hot, very anxious/scared.  I was under observation for 45minutes before they let me drive home (just 4 miles away).  Once I got home, I felt extremely exhausted and foggy headed.  This lasted for about 6 hours, and then it began to lift.  That night, I was woken from sleep suddenly by pain in my arm (at injection site); it was a sort of pain I&#39;ve never experienced -- it was sharp and moving around.  The following day (today) I&#39;m having lingering fatigue, lingering slight nausea, and a sore arm at injection site.

                                                I was vaccinated on Friday morning. Everything seemed OK. On the next day Saturday, I felt some numbness on me left upper lip and right tooth. The numbness increased and changed to my left face paralysis. I could not chew or close my left eye totally. My husband brought me to the ER on Tuesday morning. They diagnosed that I had peripheral Bell&#39;s palsy and gave prescription to me with antivirus medicine, prednison, eye oilment and eye drops, and shield to cover my left eye while I go to sleep. Today is Friday, one week after I got vaccinated. I also go to get acupuncture.

Fell asleep for about 2 hours, got up, used restroom and back to sleep - 12 hours! Friday evening right upper arm itchy - Saturday morning noticed rash on upper right arm - about the size of my hand - to the backside of injection site. Sunday afternoon - upper left arm itchy with rash like right arm.

                                                Saturday morning I woke up feeling fine. About an hour later I had a bad headache and my body started to be achy. That was followed by bilateral eye pain so that the only comfortable thing to do was to put on eye shades. I was exhausted by the afternoon. I had absolutely zero energy to do anything but lie down. By Sunday morning every inch of my skin was sensitive, every joint was sore  and every muscle group in my body was painful. The symptoms from the previous day remained; head and eye pain. I used both tylenol and advil a few times but without relief.  Monday my body/joints were still achy and I was super tired but not like the previous 2 days. I became very depressed and fearful that it would not let up. Today is Wednesday and its the first day I feel like myself again although I did have to take a nap 3 hours after I woke up today. Body still aches but nothing like it was

Note:  I have not had a flu shot for 25 years, nor have I ever had the flu during that time, but the symptoms do seem flu like.  It is now end of day 2 following the 2nd dose of vaccine and I still feel incredibly icky.

                                                Pt presented today for 1st Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine.  She received the vaccine at 11:06am and proceeded to the check out area and scheduled her second appointment and checked out at 11:10am.  She was sitting in the secondary seating area, she looked scared, then she indicated to the APP she felt dizzy, eyes fluttered back, and slumped back into the chair and into APP&#39;s arms.  With the assistance of another RN, we laid her down on the ground and lifted her legs.  She was arousable to sternal rub and complained of dizziness.  She was able to report her name and that her husband was outside in the car waiting for her, however, she was slow to answer questions and still appeared distressed.  We made several attempts to obtain a BP, however, it would not register on machine, O2 sat 100%, HR 42, manual HR 50 at pericordium.  Her bilateral upper extremities were cool to touch and appeared mottled.  We attempted to give her apple juice just she was only able to take a few sips.  We placed her on 100% non-rebreather.  Given low HR, unable to obtain BP, and semi-conscious state, we elected to call 911 at 11:30am.  Her husband was retrieved and at patient side when EMS responded.  He reported that she has fainted in the past with blood draws and has a past medical history of &#34;leaky valve, low platelets&#34; and later it discovered via her medical records that she has a history of seizures and was on vimpat and lisinoril.  EMS arrived, assessed the patient, and moved her to stretcher and transported patient at 11:39am.

She did treat with Tylenol and was able to finally sleep around 5am. She states that the headache has persisted, and she&#39;s felt &#34;nauseous, queasy, and not right&#34; since the headache started.  She is hesitant to get the second dose. She was experiencing headache following. She mentioned she is allergic to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and polymers, and thought maybe the headache was a result of an allergy to the vaccine? Ingredients don&#39;t appear to have any of her reported allergens. She had soreness in the arm the first 48 hours, which was to be expected and no big deal for her. However, starting on Tuesday, she had an excruciating headache. She normally does not typically get headaches. She believes in vaccinations and as a teacher the minute she could sign up to get one she did. Now she is terrified to get the second one. When this excruciating headache began she woke her husband up to tell what happened. She thought she was going to die, that is how bad it was and she wanted him to be aware and prepared if anything should happen. The excruciating headache started at 9PM. It was excruciating all night. The headache made her queasy because she hurt so bad. It continued into Wednesday. Today and today the pain is duller in her head, much duller than it was. However, she still feels queasy/nauseous. The headache also started with blurred vision. The blurred vision has gone away. It was like there were holes in the TV. She was thinking  it was interesting and did not think much of it at first. She thought one of her contacts had a hole in it, but she did not even have any on. The blurred vision lasted 24 hours. The soreness in arm lasted until Sunday or Monday. She confirmed the pain in arm is gone and was gone by Monday. She initially could not wait to get her shot. Now she is terrified to get the second one. She took Tylenol in the middle of the night on Tuesday and Wednesday for the headache. Has allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers. She cannot wear polyester. She has to wear 100% cotton. She is questioning if the vaccine has polymers in it. From what she heard it does and is wondering if this caused her to have like an allergic reaction. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered in Mar2021, the events Nauseous and headache was not recovered, other events was unknown.

A 63-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Mar2021 11:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history predating treatment with the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine included fracture on that left foot where the toenail came off and she had a wound that wouldn&#39;t heal. She was fully recovered from the foot injury in Dec2020. Then she came down with a positive COVID 19 test on 11Dec2020. Symptoms started on 07Dec2021 with a fever and everything and she ended up in the ER with bilateral pneumonia and they sent her home on 17Dec2020. Then later, she was admitted to the hospital on 25Dec2020 with excruciating pain in her chest, lungs and legs; and she was having shortness of breath. She was found to have a  DVT, PE and bilateral pneumonia. She was discharged 30Dec2020. She thinks she has the long time syndrome after COVID. She was still having shortness of breath, itchiness, and extreme fatigue from the COVID 19 infection but her HCP advised her to get the COVID 19 vaccine anyway. She thinks the chest congestion and cough were cleared up now, but she has noticed hair loss. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient stated that her husband, son and herself received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 02Mar2021. They all waited the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine for a reaction and was fine. Her husband and son went ahead to the car and she went to use the restroom. 20 minutes later, while in the restroom, she got a random ting outside her left foot like an electrical type very painful pain that came up the outside left ankle, leg, and calf. She had an excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf/ zinging sensation left ankle on 02Mar2021. The pain was from the same foot that she had broken before. It happened once and she was like what was that and then it stopped. Maybe 5 seconds went by then it happened again this random zap of electrical feeling that she cant really explain but it gave her whole body goosebumps. It did it 5 times in a row with pauses in between in the same exact place left lower leg. After it stopped and as she was washing her hands she had a really sharp pain in her breast on 02Mar2021 and then that was it. She walked out to the car and she didn&#39;t say anything to her husband or son because she didn&#39;t really understand what was happening and she felt fine other than the crazy pain and once it ended it ended. When she got home and in the afternoon because she was home working remotely it happened again the same exact spot left lower leg and the pain was excruciating when it was happening. This time she thinks it was four times in a row with pauses in between same exact spot just in her left lower leg. This time she told her husband &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything before but its happening again and its weird.&#34; She never had this feeling before. Adds it was so excruciating. She was just holding her breath counting how many times it will occur. It happened again that night and then she almost afraid to go to sleep because the pain would wake her up but nothing happened as she slept. She woke up the next morning and had to go to an ophthalmologist appointment and happened again while she was sitting in the chair. She had another episode of the painful zing in her foot. That was the last time it did and it might have happened again but altogether she had 4-5 episodes in a 24 hour period after receiving the vaccine. Each time she would have several painful zings. She also noticed a tingling on her lip on 03Mar2021; a painful zinging sensation on her right breast; and a tingling sensation on one finger of her hand that happened one time on 03Mar2021. That day, she had a tingling in one finger and a zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip and that was it those didn&#39;t really bother her they were more tingling and electrical feeling. She called her primary doctor and he hadn&#39;t heard of anything like it before but he cant rule it out. He said the only way you would know is if you got the shot again but she states she is a little scared. She would like to know if this side effect has been reported before and if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She was scheduled to receive the next dose on next Tuesday, 23Mar2021. She mentioned she had blood work this week but she has no results at this time. The outcome of sharp pain in her breast/ painful zinging sensation on her right breast was recovered on 02Mar2021, of excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf was recovered on 03Mar2021, of pain that came up the outside left ankle/ zinging sensation left ankle was recovered on 04Mar2021, of tingling on her lip/ zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip was recovered on 03Mar2021, and of tingle on the right hand finger/ electrical feeling was  recovered on 03Mar2021.

She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto&#39;s - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn&#39;t mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn&#39;t have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn&#39;t walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can&#39;t walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn&#39;t , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven&#39;t had it since. It&#39;s almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could&#39;ve affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn&#39;t know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn&#39;t know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn&#39;t want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can&#39;t explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn&#39;t want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn&#39;t mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn&#39;t really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn&#39;t know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles. All events (AEs) did not require a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office. The events of Tunnel vision, rush of pressure to back of head and the lower part of head, Headache, dizzy/Dizziness/light headed, cloudy and pressure in her ears/Ear Pressure, was recovered on 01Apr2021, of my arm started to really hurt/Sore Arm; sore to touch was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

Control No.: 21K-163-3848385-00). A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6207) intramuscular in the right arm on 18Mar2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA) solution for injection, subcutaneously, from an unspecified date at an unspecified dose and frequency for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Medical history included polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), RA, hypothyroidism, anemia. The patient had no known allergies. It was unknown if the patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included prednisone, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), folic acid, calcium carbonate (CAL). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of BNT162B2. On 18Mar2021 (within 4 hours of the vaccination), the patient experienced a rheumatoid arthritis flare up. The clinical course was as follows: on 18Mar2021 at 15:00, the patient experienced pain in elbow and finger pain (like trigger finger of both hands). On Mar2021 (within 24 hours), all fingers were involved, the patient&#39;s grip strength was decreased (she could not make a fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands) and experienced left wrist pain. On Mar2021 (within 48 hours), the patient experienced finger edema, was still unable to make fist or grasp, experienced painful shooting pains up inner arms, right ear &amp; head pains. The patient increased the prednisone dose to 4 mg daily as treatment for the events. On 21Mar2021 at 11:00 (72 hours after vaccination), the patient continued to experience bilateral arm pains, slight hand grips but could not lift, new right knee and right outer foot pains. On 21Mar2021 (94 hours after vaccination), there was less arm pain and finger edema, continued right ear/head pains. The patient saw the primary physician, there was no ear infection and the physician agreed with the prednisone increase. The physician felt the patient should not take the second vaccine dose and alerted the rheumatologist. On 22Mar2021 (116 hours after vaccination), the patient was able to lift and grasp with both hands, had less ear and arm pain. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The action taken with adalimumab in response to the events was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events trigger finger, inability to grip or grasp with her hands, severe flare of RA symptoms 4 hours post vaccine, pain in arms and elbows, pain in ears was not provided. The clinical outcome of rheumatoid arthritis flare up, trigger finger, &#34;grip strength decreased/could not make fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands&#34;, pain in arm, right ear &amp; head pains was resolving; while of pain in elbow was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the RA flare and other events.  The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp; her lips had started swelling; her tongue was tingling; she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction; she was just tired; type 1 hypersensitivity; a little soreness; It was like heaviness on her chest; having trouble breathing; allergic contact dermatitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a physician. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn&#39;t have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn&#39;t have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn&#39;t even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can&#39;t really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event &#39;she was just tired&#39; was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

As the day went on I developed slight swelling of my upper lip.  The burning of my face lasted until the following day but then would come and go.  The swelling of my upper lips lasted  4 days.  Last Thursday 1/7/2021 my face was burning and lasted the day.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 15:00 at 0.45 mL, single dose (225mcg) at left arm to prevent COVID. Medical history included a bout of dry mouth about 7 years ago, no other relevant medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There&#39;s no adverse events following prior vaccinations. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

Then after that the dry mouth started right after. It is tolerable but she still had it. Mentioned she had a bout of dry mouth about 7 years ago and it did go away, but she never got a diagnosis for it. Patient thought that something underlying may have triggered it again. Patient also experienced burning of the tongue, tiredness, headaches, pressure in the chest area similar to difficulty in breathing, nausea, dizziness, and a fast heartbeat on unspecified date. Outcome of event dry mouth was not recovered, outcome of event bitter taste was recovered on unspecified date in Dec2020, outcome of other events was unknown. No family medical history relevant to adverse events. No relevant tests. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse events resulted in neither doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, nor emergency room/department or urgent care.   Relatedness of Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine with dry mouth and bitter taste per primary source reporter with method of assessment of global Introspection was related. Reporter seriousness for event bitter taste was not serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of dry mouth cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                Has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands; She still has a cough and no taste; She still has a cough and no taste; The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot; Body aches; Chills; Nausea; Tired; Diarrhea; Had a fever reached 100.0; Joint hurt, all of them; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

She has had this problem before and thinks it is because her blood pressure is elevated.  Client was not feeling well enough to drive home so her husband came and got her. She said after she was home for a few minutes she felt better. She was able to pick her car up within 2 hours of the incident. She did call her PCP and let them know.

                                                37 hours after Pfizer injection,  experienced severe abdominal pain that caused me to have vasovagal syncope.  Started sweating, and I lost my vision, then must have fallen on the floor.   When I came to, felt very headachy and nauseous.   went to urgent care - they ordered an abdominal scan for 2/8/21 but scan did not reveal the cause of the pain.  8 hours later on 2/5/21, started feeling asthma like symptoms.  Throat felt tight, voice became hoarse, kept having to cough because airway was starting to feel thickened.   went to ER, they took vitals and told me that i wasn&#39;t having  an allergic reaction because my symptoms were outside the time frame for an allergic reaction.  After 3 hours there, they sent me home.  Next morning felt like I was having heart palpitations. that feeling eventually went away if I walked around.  But the following two mornings, I had the same feeling.

                                                12 hours after receiving vaccine I woke up from a deep sleep because my tongue felt thick and too big for my mouth.  I am a RN so I assessed myself.  No tingling.  No numbness.  No difficulty breathing.  I could swallow my saliva.  Fell back asleep.  Soon after I woke up again and thought wow my tongue is huge and it is occupying my entire mouth.  I looked in the mirror and my tongue was huge.  Swollen and the knobs on the back of my tongue were huge too.  No other symptoms.  I grabbed my cell phone and was able to fall back asleep.  In the AM my tongue belt better and only the sides felt funny.  Visually, my tongue had decreased and I could again see the groves and marks in my tongue which were gone when it was swollen.  On AM of 2/19 it appeared to resolve completely.

Could not report symptoms but if had been asked directly could have. REalised half way driving home that I should not be driving. Eurphoria lasted for 24 hours. Was on phone constantly the next day for 7 hours straight without eating.  Could not remember what some items were like a drone. Had to ask = that thing that flies with a camera. Short term memory loss that continues. Facial numbness began 48 hours after injection. Facial numbness continues changing in areas of right side of my face. Felt extremely vulnerable. Wore my same clothing for 4 days as I did not remember that I had clean clothing. Did not remember that I should notify medical personal until late 2/20.

I could feel pressure in my ear but hearing was distinctly muffled. I took 2 &#34;DayQuil&#34; cold capsules hoping an antihistamine might alleviate the situation. I had no relief until 8 hours later when I noticed the pressure in my ear was reduced and my hearing seems to be returning to normal.

I sat immediately because I felt I was about to faint. I waited 20 min for the dizziness to diminish and was able to walk by myself. My vision was blurry and felt my eyes were moving rapidly side to side. My husband drove me home because I still fell too dizzy to drive back home. The dizziness continued the day of the 2nd dose administration and got less bothersome if I stayed in bed. The following day the dizziness was much less but I still stayed in bed. Monday March 15 I also experienced dizziness and stayed in bed. Since the first dose on Feb 09, 21 I have felt tired and not always being able to complete my physical therapy routine. The tiredness is not every day. It comes and goes.

Left to  go home, my face cheeks started to turn red within the next 30 minutes. A couple of hours later my skin was tingling, itching, even inside my ears, around my ankles. Took some Benadryl, knowing that it was an allergic reaction, but it didn&#39;t help. Couldn&#39;t sleep, felt like my skin was crawling. Around 4 am my skin finally calmed down. Sent a message to my Dr. to let him know what happened. Still some lingering itching the next day. Today is Friday March 19, most everything is back to normal.

                                                Extreme  (!), severe pain in LEFT jaw/remple/upper lower molars.  Radiating to back of eye, ear/temple area, upper and lower molars.  Started on 3/18 lasted 3-4 hours then went away.  Another attack on morning of 3/19 - lasted several hours and went away.  Another attack afternoon of 3/19 - even more sever.  Went to E.R.  at the hospital.  Thought it was an abscessed tooth at first but later realized that the tooth itself was not really sensitive.  Diagnosed as  trigeminal neuralgia by a nurse practitioner.  Prescribed  Baclafen and Pennicillian (in case it was caused by tooth abscess).  Baclafen was successful in moderating the pain to tolerable levels.  Have had several smaller attacks since when eating (even though  I am avoiding chewing on left side).  Seems to be set off by hot or cold foods possibly(??).  No noticeable swelling .  The thing is that I have NEVER had this kind of nerve pain in my jaw or anywhere else at all (save for an attack of Shingles 2 yrs ago) .  possibly this is just a coincidence but it seems odd that this occurs two weeks after the injection when my health has been fine thus far.

At the 30 minute mark, pt came over to this RN to report &#34;her tongue felt a little funny.&#34;  She stated she has chronic issues with a tingling sensation to her tongue, however this was different and her tongue felt &#34;bigger and different than normal.&#34;  She denied having difficulty swallowing, SOB, scratchy throat.  25mg Benadryl was given PO per protocol.  She drank an entire bottle of water without difficulty and was able to hold a conversation without difficulty.  Pt waited 20 minutes post benadryl and stated she was feeling better, with one side of her tongue &#34;feeling back to normal.&#34;  Recommended taking 25mg benadryl PO q6h x48h and calling PCP today to describe reaction and benadryl recommendations.  Explained they may want to see her or change medication recommendations and pt voiced understanding stating she was going to call her PCP, however she felt better and wanted to leave instead of further monitoring.  Educated on if symptoms worsened for any reason and pt experienced any SOB, difficulty swallowing, or worsening symptoms of any kind to go to the Emergency Department and pt voiced understanding.

Medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. The patient received the first shot of COVID-19 vaccine in the morning of 18Mar2021, and after supper, she experienced severe stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and stated that she blacked out. She mentioned that she is just taking it slow and eating broth. She confirmed that blacking out has only happened to her 2 other times in her life. She said that it usually happens with the cramping and the vomiting in this same kind of situation. She plans to follow up with the physician. She said that she has a pretty swollen black eye that is really red too (unspecified date). She is putting ice on it. It did not seem like she ate anything that would cause this reaction.

A 64-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6208), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 64 years old), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing thyroid (disorder) (Unspecified thyroid condition). It is the vaccines with aluminum and bovine extract that she knows that she can&#39;t handle. Caller reported that she got a flu vaccine at work and that she definitely got the flu within a few minutes of receiving the flu vaccine.  Caller reported that another time after receiving the flu vaccine, she definitely got the flu but she was unsure of the time frame.  Caller reported that she did have the flu vaccine several times but that two times, the flu vaccine definitely gave her the flu.  She has 3 brothers and that one of her brothers that she is a  caregiver for has Type 1 Diabetes. Her brother just felt like he had to have 2 vaccines several years ago and that he received the pneumonia and flu vaccines. Her brother was hospitalized within days of receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines.  Her brother was placed in the ICU for heart patients and the medical staff at the hospital was not sure if her brother was going to live. She couldn&#39;t remember how long her brother was hospitalized for, caller stated she thinks maybe around 10 days.She knows what she knows, her 2 other brothers were also hospitalized as children. She didn&#39;t know if her brothers had vaccines  before they were hospitalized but that she would bet money that vaccines they had received are what resulted in hospitalization.When hospitalized, her second brother was not expected to live. At the time of the event, her brother was only 1 or 2 years old. Her brother&#39;s infection was so bad that the hospital sent blood to the CDC and that the CDC couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with her brother.The hospital kept giving IV antibiotics to her brother and he lived. Her third brother hospitalized around 5 years old with pneumonia during the summer. She didn&#39;t know if her brother had received any vaccinations at that time. She just thinks the vaccines did that to them but she doesn&#39;t know that.  Someone gave her first brother the information on the pneumonia and flu vaccines he received prior to his hospitalization. She didn&#39;t have information regarding the details of the vaccines that her brother received.The facility where her first brother was vaccinated with flu and pneumonia vaccines would not give her the information on the vaccines that her brother received.  Caller reported that it was a really hard time to fight the facility for that information and she was shocked the facility wouldn&#39;t give her the requested information.  Caller reported that they wouldn&#39;t give her any medication records or anything.  Caller reported that it was a bad time for her to fight it, and that she will eventually go back and tell them they have to give her the information.Her brother that she is a caregiver for and that was hospitalized after receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines also had the Covid-19 vaccine on 16Mar2021.  Caller reported that she had been more concerned about her brother having a reaction as he has serious health issues, including Type 1 Diabetes and a heart condition.

She doesn&#39;t know how much she is still dizzy when asked if it was still ongoing. She added she has been taking Benadryl and ginger for the dizziness and nausea and it helps a lot.She has been taking ginger for the nausea, and if she still has a little, it&#39;s not as much.Today is an overcast day and that it&#39;s an easy day for her.

When it&#39;s UV light, more so in the afternoon on sunny days, but technically the artificial light in the evening some days bothers her too.She doesn&#39;t think her lymph nodes were bothering her before 29Mar2021.

A 64-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER2613, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 1900 wherein blood pressure was high prior to her atrial fibrillation medications; A fib (atrial fibrillation) from 2016 and ongoing; and ongoing heartrate low.

Family medical history included mom has hypertension. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day; sotalol taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 80 mg, twice a day; and diltiazem taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 180 mg, once a day.  The patient was a healthcare worker and she has had friends who have died from covid. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient stated she had the first dose of the vaccine and had a TIA (Apr2021) and rupture of a blood vessel in her eye 20Mar2021. The TIA was on Monday (Apr2021) and she was supposed to have her second dose tomorrow (09Apr2021). She stated she may get it but she is not taking it tomorrow because she is still having residual symptoms. She asked what the length of time she can wait to get it before she has to restart. Patient reported that after she got her first vaccine she had a ruptured blood vessel in her eye the next day (20Mar2021). She put warm and cool compresses on her eye then the ruptured blood vessel subsided. The ruptured blood vessel came back again a few days later and this time it was the entire sclera. She developed blood clots in her eye and the doctor said it probably wasn&#39;t from the vaccine (Mar2021). She was supposed to get her second dose of the vaccine tomorrow 09Apr2021 but she was going to hold off for now. She then had a TIA (Mar2021) and became hospitalized because of it from 06Apr2021 to 07Apr2021. The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation but has been taking her medication religiously. She believed that the TIA was from the vaccine as there was no explanation as to why it happened. Her heart rate was low anyways from the medications (dates unspecified) but it dropped to 35 when she was in the hospital (Apr2021). The patient&#39;s primary care provide was not the attending in the hospital when the caller was hospitalized. Furthermore, it was reported that on 21Mar2021, patient&#39;s eye was super red but only on one side of her left eye. On Tuesday, 22Mar2021, caller went to see her primary care provider and they told the patient to put a warm compress and no eye drops in her eye, that helped. Then that Friday, 25Mar2021, the patient&#39;s sclera looked like her eye was bleeding and her pupil started turning a different color.  Then last Monday (Apr2021), the patient woke up and her right arm, the right side of her face, and her right knee were numb she got up and went to see if she had a facial droop and did not. The patient thought it was from her sleeping wrong, but these symptoms did not go away. The patient went to the Emergency Room where they did a CT of her head and neck, with and without contrast which was negative. The patient was admitted on 06Apr2021 to the observation unit where they did an MRI and ECHO, which were both negative and she was diagnosed with a TIA and possible pinched nerve (Apr2021). The patient denied any heavy lifting prior to this event other than normal day to day things. The patient was discharged on Wednesday 07Apr2021. The patient&#39;s face felt like its burning, she has numbness in her right finger and right thumb. Physical therapy and occupational therapy said the patient should be okay but to be careful with things that were hot because she was at risk of burning herself. The second time the patient&#39;s eye became red, her vision was kind of blurry (Apr2021) and she didn&#39;t know if the blood was in her pupil. The only deficit that the patient has now is sensational loss in her right hand (Apr2021) and that should improve per the occupational therapist at the hospital. The caller was supposed to get the second dose of the vaccine on 09Apr2021 but she doesn&#39;t want to take it while she is having these symptoms. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient included: head ct with and without contrast: negative on 06Apr2021; MRI brain: negative on 06Apr2021; Echocardiogram: negative on 07Apr2021; speech evaluation: passed on 07Apr2021.

                                                Monday, the day after the 2nd vaccine injection, I had a Temperature of 103.1, Chills, Muscle &amp; joint pain, dizziness, Fatigue Tuesday day, felt better. I was able to go out to the grocery store. Around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, I began feeling inflammation on the gums of my teeth, and roof of my mouth felt like it was burned; it got so bad that I could not eat or drink due to tongue hitting the roof of my mouth &amp; causing MUCH pain.  I did the best I could on Wednesday but then could no longer take it. I contacted my doctor who prescribed viscous lidocaine in order for me to eat &amp; drink. I was only able to eat very soft food. My doctor had not come across anyone with this side effect. But the lidocaine helped a lot and I had to use it for several days. Symptoms started to subside on Saturday and are improving daily but it is still very sensitive even as of this time, 10 days after this 2nd vaccine shot.

A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:00 in left deltoid at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, bilateral thyroidectomy in 2014. Family Medical History: Father died of lung cancer. Mother died of cardiac arrest in 1972. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for bilateral thyroidectomy. The patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 27Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. The patient did not have reactions with other immunizations except a severe reaction with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine when she was younger. She had seizures after receiving the MMR vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient mentioned she had a severe reaction. She described her adverse reaction by having intense headaches, having stroke-like symptoms in which she described as she cannot speak, having headaches, having numbness in her hands, face, and lips. She also felt exhausted. She also had some pain in her arm that she is not concerned about. She mentioned that she also has her vision affected, she couldn&#39;t drive, there were wavy lines all though her eyes. She started to have hallucinations such as seeing people that weren&#39;t there, seeing snow storms, and seeing things whipping throughout the wind. All the events started on 04Jan2021. She reported she was very sick in the hospital and is now getting well. However it was unknown if she was admitted to hospital (clarification pending). She wanted to know recommendations about the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine because with her experience, she is not comfortable having the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This happened immediately and is ongoing.  Also, I had diarrhea the next day.  See #280380 submission.   I had spoken with others who had taken the Moderna vaccine, and they said they had no reactions to their vaccine.  So, I was very taken off guard when I had the reaction approx 5 minutes after the vaccine was given.  It was pretty scary.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 16Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose as the patient is a counselor, essential worker, in the health field but she got in because of age (COVID-19 immunization). Medical history included Subclinical hypothyroid (she takes no meds. Was diagnosed 10 years ago), allergies to Sulfa drug, seasonal allergies and sprained wrist. A couple antibiotics bother her stomach but she was not allergic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included estradiol, B12, calcium and glucosamine. Other medications included estrogen, vitamins, glucosamine supplements, and takes a cream for injury: sprained wrist, she doesn&#39;t know the name of it, it is an anti-inflammatory cream, she doesn&#39;t think any of that will do anything. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had the vaccine on 16Jan2021 Saturday and within 15 minutes (also reported as 20 minutes after shot and at 12:00), the patient experienced severe ringing in ears. She had severe ringing in her ears, it was really loud, and was still there. She can&#39;t seem to figure out if it was normal, what&#39;s causing it and could it be from the vaccine. It may have been anxiety because of that, but right after she heard ringing, there was a lump feeling in her throat on same day, like something was in her throat, she thought she had throat swelling, it lasted a couple of days, but she had no shortness of breath or anything. Ringing in ears was a lot worse in the morning, and gets better during the day, maybe because she was around noise, but it comes and goes, there are two separate sounds, one was a high pitched and continuous, the other one was lower pitched, a little fragmented, if she drew a picture, there would be little dust particles in the air, but the other is constant, she tried really hard to ignore, but it was driving her nuts. She is hoping it will go away. The lump feeling in her throat was gone, she was wondering if it was anxiety. It was mentioned, &#34;She gets nervous, gets a lump in her throat a lot&#34;, but this was really severe, but she saw a man being taken away in an ambulance, and that scared her, she was waiting in the waiting area, and saw that, so it scared her. Recovered completely from the lump feeling in her throat. Throat was normal in 2 days but ears ringing still there after 4 days. There was no treatment for the events severe ringing in ears and Lump feeling in throat. The outcome of the events severe ringing in ears was not recovered; event Lump feeling in throat and throat swelling was recovered in 18Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other event.

                                                About 1/2 hour of the vaccination, I felt mild tingling of the lips.  Very gradually, that got worse (over the nest few hours) and I had tingling of hands and feet.  I gradually developed facial swelling (my lips were enlarged and felt firm, as did my nose).  I checked my pulse ox, and it remained above 97%.  I never had rash or trouble breathing.  But  about 5 hours after receiving the immunization, I took some Benadryl, and over about 1/2 hour I could feel that things were improving.  Over the next 24 hours I took Benadryl again two times, due to return of the tingling sensation of my lips.  I also felt very cold, and had a hard time getting warm.  This also improved with the Benadryl.

At 7am I awoke again and was seeing double from my left eye.  Was seen my an ophthalmologist and dx w 4th nerve palsy- Left eye.  I have no underlying medical conditions to explain this, ie no diabetes, HTN etc..  At this time 02//05/2021 I continue to have double vision , the image is sloping downward,  head movement and keeping my left eye open results in this woozy feeling of imbalance and nausea.

This consumer reported for self that the 65-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Covid Vaccine, lot: EL3247, Expiration Date: 30May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the shot (Covid vaccine, Pfizer) a couple of days ago and I experienced the weird side effects. I just wanted to know if that was normal things or if I need to report this? I had a metallic taste in base of my throat and after that I have like burning in my throat. I had another question before you change. I was reading the pamphlets that was given to me at the clinic and it says that it is been in clinic trial an approximately 20,000 individuals have received the vaccine is that all? I had the vaccine on 21Jan2021 and it started immediately afterwards. No, it went away on following day.&#34; No treatment received. The outcome of the event was recovered in Jan2021.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine I lost complete hearing in my left ear. I waited until the next morning to see if hearing would return. It did not and I contacted my doctor at the Clinic and was referred for an audiology test on Thursday at 9:30am followed by a appointment with an ENT. My hearing loss was profound and I was started on high dosages of steroids for a 14 day course of action. I also had a head MRI done on Monday February 8 with no significant findings. My hearing has begun to improve but at this point is not back to normal and it may never be the same. My biggest question is whether or not I should take the second vaccine. I also have a significant bruise at the injection sight that I still have 10 days later.

I woke up on 02/11/2021 around 7AM with left axillary lymphadenopathy approximately the size of a tennis ball cut in half with associated moderate discomfort. The discomfort resolved by 02/14/2021, but the lymphadenopathy remains at about half the mass noticed originally.

                                                On February 11, 2 days after my vaccination, I woke up with pain and swelling under my left eye.  Over the next 2 days, the left side of my face under the eye experienced redness and swelling then subsided and localized into a large stye on the lower left eyelid.  Now,  a week later, the stye is still red and pus filled but has improved and is slowly resolving.   I would not normally think that this affliction had anything to do with getting a vaccine but it does seem strange that something like this could occur in someone who is very healthy and and does not experience any side effects from vaccines.   The last time I had a stye was in my 20&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as the one I am now experiencing.   Since the Covid vaccine is so new and however unrelated this coincidental affliction seems, I thought I should report it regardless.

Medical history included ongoing ongoing asthma all of her life, ongoing tinnitus 10 years approximately, allergies to everything, environmental allergies, medication, food allergies, contact allergies, ongoing fibromyalgia a decade, ongoing gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 10-15 years.

Concomitant medication included gabapentin (GABAPENTIN) 200 mg, 1x/day at bedtime) for Fibromyalgia, famotidine (PEPCID) OTC dose in morning and night FOR GERD.   After vaccination, towards 04Feb2021 evening, she started losing hearing in her left ear. That was late afternoon. It started with some pressure, and some loss of hearing. By 05Feb2021 it got worse. So she gave herself Sudafed because she was thinking it was normal allergies. By 06Feb2021, it wasn&#39;t better. The Sudafed did not seem to help. She went to the Urgent care on 06Feb2021, who told her to go to ENT. She has an ENT appointment on 09Feb2021. The Urgent care prescribed her a short dose of prednisone by mouth 10mg twice a day. She has looked, and not find loss of hearing as a side effect. She hasn&#39;t called the doctor yet. The hearing loss has persisted or worsened. It is not constant all day long, but it is there all day long. As of on 09Feb2021, it was pretty bad. On 04Feb2021 she was also experiencing ear ringing. It was a high pitched ring in the same ear. She had tinnitus in both ears, but it was usually low. This one since the pressure started building in her ear, the ringing was louder and bigger. The ringing was worsening. The outcome of events was not recovered.

The patient called the doctor on 01Feb2021, but they were out because of the snow. On 02Feb2021, the patient received a call from the doctor&#39;s office saying that the physician assistant would call her back, but the patient had not heard anything yet.

The patient said that her daughter sent her something that said that some people have gotten Bell&#39;s palsy after getting the vaccine. The patient said that she was concerned about this with the facial numbness.  The patient said that every once in a while, her face felt weird; her cheeks feel weird and her nose. The patient said that it comes and goes.  The day after she got the second shot, she felt like she got run over by a truck and like someone beat her up. The patient&#39;s migraines were under control with magnesium. The migraine came on so quick it was like a boom. The patient said that was why she was concerned. The patient said that she declined going to the hospital; and there was no trip to the emergency room or physician office.

A 65-years-old female non-pregnant patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EN5318 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 02Feb2021 15:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no covid prior vaccination. On 02Feb2021 16:00 (30 minutes after receiving the vaccination), The patient lost complete hearing in her left ear. The patient informed that it came on very suddenly and did not improve by the next morning. The patient contacted her doctor at the clinic and was scheduled for a hearing test on Thursday at 9:30 and an appointment with an ENT afterwards. The hearing was almost completely gone based on the audiology test (Feb2021). The patient began very high levels of steroids for a 14-day program and her hearing has started to return. The patient also had an MRI done on Monday (Feb2021) showing no abnormalities. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient informed that this seemed to be a very real coincidence that the vaccine triggered this response to her hearing. The outcome of the event was recovering. The event was considered serious (disability).

                                                Six days after receiving my second vaccine at a mass drive-thru site (on 2/25), I experienced plugged ears -- a feeling of congestion, pressure and mild pain. Then three days after that, on 2/28, I became dizzy and nauseous, causing vomiting and a feeling that I may faint. My husband took me to Urgent Care where I was diagnoses with BPPV and prescribed meclizine and ondansetron. I have been doing the Epley maneuver and my condition has improved somewhat, but I still feel fatigued and the pressure in my ears has not subsided. I cannot hear correctly out of my left ear. I am concerned that I now have Meniere&#39;s disease, which can be caused by &#34;abnormal immune response&#34; -- the vaccine? I have an appointment with an ENT specialist on 3/25 and hopefully can get some answers at that time.

The worst of it lasted about 5 minutes but weakness and shaking continued for about an hour.  2) Over the course of several hours developed sore arm and headache which worsened over the next 12 hours but was not terribly bad.  3) Days 3-6 had stiffness which began at injection site and went up left shoulder into the left side of neck.  Resolved by day 7.  4) ON DAY EIGHT I developed a rash and itching at the injection site.  Also had a dry cough and sinus drainage but cannot be certain this was from the vaccination but the rash and itching definitely was.  The rash resolved by day 12.  It was not terribly bad and no drugs were needed to calm the itch.

I was dizzy and could not stand without support for any length of time during the next 5 hrs.  My sensecof taste was affected for almost a week- a weird &#34;milk of magnesia &#34; taste no matter what I ate.  12 hours later I was well enough to be on my feet, 24 hours after that I had very little recollection of the prior days activities or conversations.

I have been told- those with the greatest immunity system will have the worst side effects- I am not sure that makes

Started to black out and went down but not unconscious. Then bowel movement and nausea at same time and started dripping sweat profusely. Soaked my clothes. So weak could not get up or felt as though will pass out. Then got the chills and loud ringing in my ears. Whole episode lasted about 20-30 minutes then went to bed at 7:30 p.m. felt so exhausted and fatigued. Woke up about 4a.m. arm hurt but felt okay. Little off balance, fatigued, weak all day. Next day arm sore but improving. Now fine. Saw doctor today, he advised me to report and wait to see advice from Pfizer as to get2d dose or not.

I don?t take my bp,often, dr offices etc. 4 weeks ago, I felt pressure around eyes, in back of neck, weak, dizzy. My bp had spiked to 203/104, my husband called the ambulance. I went to ER. Bp went down, I came home, same thing happened the next day. Back in again.... Since then, I have had just about every test possible. I am perfectly healthy on paper. I just don?t know what to,do.... have now taken some bp meds and beta blocker. I can feel my bp spiking several times a day. 170/93 and then after a while back down again. I feel like I might be allergic to whatever is in my body. My hands and face tingle, I feel hot and then cold.  I am praying this will ease it way out after the vaccine wears off. Needless to,say I am super concerned. I have ALWAYs been very healthy, fit and happy with a busy life.

                                                About 10 minutes after the shot I felt a warm sensation inside my arm running all the way down to my arm and my hand went numb .  I waited a few more minutes then I was released.  Then 1/2 hour later my eyes were very sensitive to light I wore sunglasses. Then five hours after the shot I had chest discomfort on left side of my chest which felt like I was having a heart attack pain subsided then every 2 hours it came and went until the middle of the night. Then next day still having same chest pain. Then I had difficulty swallowing was choking so I called my doctor. I also had trouble breathing. Dr. Advised to go to ER if I needed to. I rested and rested and monitored myself. Blood pressure fluctuated somewhat. Still had chest pain and discomfort 24 hours after the vaccine. I had never had chest pain or discomfort before. It was quite alarming. Not being able to swallow was alarming also. Several years ago I had an allergic reaction to a cleaning problem some of the same symptoms it was very scary no heart or chest pain with that allergic reaction to a cleaning product that had bleach in the product.

                                                Extreme migraine. Head pain, neck pain, nausea, vomiting,, dizziness, overall weakness, light sensitivity.  I have migraine disease but since I began Aimovig injections nearly a year ago I have very few migraines,  Those I have had have been extremely mild, just headache usually relieved by otc meds. Additionally I have not had nausea and vomiting with any migraine episode for many years.  When I woke at yesterday morning, I was in extreme pain across the right side and back of my head and down to my neck and shoulders. 9 out 10. I took my prescription, Eletriptan .5 mg at 5:45 and went back to bed.  It gave little relief of symptoms. I was unable to sleep and at about 7 a.m. I was hit with waves of nausea and extreme violent vomiting. This last for several minutes. At approximately 9 a.m. I took a 2nd dose of Eletriptan and slept a little. Again at about 11: a.m. I was hit with another round of extreme nausea and vomiting which lasted about 5-6 minutes. I slept a bit and around 3 p.m. was finally able to drink a little water. Still very weak but pain had subsided significantly, down to about a 4 / 10.  By 6 pm. I was almost pain free ? symptom free though very weak still. Ate a little at about 7 p.m.  I know this was a migraine which I am diagnosed with but it was extreme even for me, and especially in recent years. It was very  unusual in timing and severity  and I felt it needed reporting.

Appeared a coiple of days after first shot and was present for second dose on 3/9/21.  Bitter taste..sensitive inside lips..roof of mouth. Nothing gets rid of it. vaccine has caused &#34;Burning Mouth Syndrome&#34; from some damage to the facial nerve. Did feel intense pain under ear 20 hours after second shot.....but bitterness had already manifested after first shot. Never had this issue ever and it makes eating and just &#34;being&#34; very challenging. People should know about this potential side effect. I researched thoroughly but never saw anything from vaccine  on this. Yet now informally have read of many other sufferers of this harsh and lasting side effect.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine she experienced a very strong, pungent and sharp taste and smell, which passed within 5 minutes.  In those 5 minutes the next thing was tingling in her face, cheeks, lips and her sinuses which were not clogged up at the time cleared, which stayed that way until Saturday morning.  She did have tingling and numbness in her fingers, but nothing in her feet, and did not extend beyond her face and cheeks.  Then 20 minutes later at 1:55 PM her tongue became sort of thick and a little numb, but did not swell.   The area between her tongue and mouth tightened and her jaw tightened but nothing swelled.  No itching in the throat.  She had some sort of aching like menstrual cramps but has had a hysterectomy.  She did also have a headache, took a Tylenol at 2:15 and went to sleep.  When she woke up had fatigue, sore arm, and everything else had passed other than the lips feeling prickly and numb.  The tongue was no longer tight or in the jaw.  Just still had the open sinuses and the headache.  The most significant thing was the thickness and lack of feeling of her tongue.   By Saturday she was fine other than the normal side effects, soreness of arm, no red rash, but had been  moving it around.

This time I am having more effects. Immediately I had blurred vision in my right eye and facial muscle tightening.  Upon arriving home I  became severely fatigued and and still am 24 hours later.  As of 16 hours later I developed severe pain in the right arm only, body aches, loss of taste and various facial tightening sensations and swelling tongue (I took Zyrtec for the latter and that helps). NO anaphylaxis.  THese may go away in the next day or so but that is as yet unknown.

My blood pressure increased to around 212/101 for much of the day.  Normal is around 120/70.  The dizziness finally subsided later in the day and the blood pressure went down to about 168/85 by evening.  Then I minor developed a headache.  I also developed sores in my mouth and on my tongue.  I still have those today (the day after).

Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

                                                Started about 3am Saturday Morning March 6 with extreme pain between shoulder blades. Took 2 Advil and was able to go back to sleep. Woke in the morning feeling fine. Then started becoming ill early afternoon. Fever every day for 2 weeks. Nausea, vomiting, lose of appetite, extreme fatigue, headache, light sensitivity, rash, nagging slight cough and some nasal stuffiness mostly when talking (this might be because of the pollen) We were told it was an unidentified virus that would have to &#34;run its course&#34;. Even though we are vaccinated, we continue to quarantine because we provide child care for my grandson. There was virtually no circumstance where I would have been exposed to a virus. Also, my husband had to care for me because I could do almost nothing for myself and he did not contract the virus.

A 65-year-old female consumer patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 04Mar2021 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included, in the 1990&#39;s, was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (limited, used to be called CREST scleroderma), pretty severe Raynaud&#39;s syndrome, telangiectases, fatigue and sometimes joint aches. Patient was healthy despite this. Patient was not pregnant. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. Concomitant medications in two weeks included amlodipine besylate, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), and clonazepam (KLONOPIN). The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 11Feb2021 04:00 PM and felt unwell but went to work and was fine in 2 days. On 04Mar2021, it was very different, the patient began having symptoms within 4 hours after receiving vaccine at 9 o clock that night. The patient stated &#34;symptoms worsened and it is one week today and I am still sick. My fever broke on Monday. I still have cruel, incapacitating headache, eye pain, aversion to food (extremely weird for me), constant watery diarrhea despite not much food, constant nausea, utter and complete lassitude, dehydration (hospitalized, 2 liters of fluids), pain meds and anti-nausea meds. I have missed a week of work and this is a serious issue for many. I am OK but using precious sick time.&#34; Events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient stated &#34;I missed whole week to work and I&#39;m still sick. I have had so many different symptoms and some have gone away like my fever is gone but I have such a painful headache that I can&#39;t eat, nausea and constant diarrhea, you get the idea. I&#39;m not against the vaccine but I think it would be good if people like me, people that have had my experience know, I hope it&#39;s within the normal range, I still don&#39;t know I would love to talk to somebody and find out if what I am experiencing is in the normal range, but it&#39;s not, people saying they experience so far the kind of the level of being in bed, low energy, unable to eat, fever, headache, stomach upset, I didn&#39;t have a cold, I had respiratory, I had a cough that has cleared up. I was hospitalized yesterday with fluids to become hydrated. It&#39;s important for us, you know, I mean, I leave the work that not good, people need to be prepared, it should be sick time I think it&#39;s important there is a follow up, absolutely. I was very happy I got the vaccine but I am so sick and it&#39;s been a week today so, that&#39;s why I decided to call and I was in the hospital yesterday, getting fluids dehydrated and I was admitted (reason for hospitalization was not clarified). I wasn&#39;t admitted, I was in the hospital for the day on IV fluids, anti-nausea medication, pain medication also, 3 things they gave me in an IV. They sent me home but the diarrhea I have so bad, I&#39;m exhausted, but I have to spent all my time in the toilet, I thought today might be, I might wake up it would be healing today but I&#39;m still pretty sick.&#34; Outcome of fever and cough was recovered, and of remaining events was not recovered. The patient underwent COVID-19 virus test via nasal swab on 03Mar2021 with negative result.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half. Confirmed she was not admitted just in the Emergency Room. On 04Mar202 the patient was at the hospital and was gasping for breath. The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her.

Patient asked if there was a conclusion about the PEG and her anaphylactic reaction. Her second dose was scheduled on 25Mar2021. Patient stated that her PCP and the CDC recommend to not get the second dose. Caller wanted to know if the anaphylaxis could be worse in the second dose. The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6198, NDC number: 59267100001, Expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 65-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

On 06Mar2021, her lymph nodes in her throat swelled up and her throat was raw, painful, super red and she could hardly talk, it also created a lot of congestion in chest- the lobes. The swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. She wound up going to the doctor and they prescribed her an antibiotic which cleared the infection in her throat. Her symptoms started two days after she received the shot. She is supposed to get the second shot on Thursday 25Mar2021 and that&#39;s why she is calling to find out information on what other people reported as far as asthma patients. She is debating on getting the second shot. Initially caller states that for the most part, it cleared up and went away about three days ago, but then explains it is gradually getting better. Every once in a while, her throat feels dry and raw, but she drinks water and it feels better. At first, she did not want to really talk. She has asthma, the congestion never really goes away and it didn&#39;t really improve this time after prednisone like it usually does. She did not feel good on Friday, but on Saturday it got bad. Her side effects have improved from what they were then. The patient recovered from the event swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. The outcome of got pretty sick and throat feels dry was unknown and the outcome of the remaining events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 12:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), at the age of 65-years-old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to Sulfa. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included calcium; magnesium; colecalciferol, menadione (VITAMIN K&#43;D); glutathione; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Within 45 mins (also reported as 20-25 minutes) of receiving the shot, she began to feel her left cheek tingle. In the intervening days, her left forehead, cheek, side of lip and chin felt like she had razor burn. Her head itched. Her left eye felt dry, but that went away. She began to salivate more than usual from the left side of her mouth. The left side of her face began to feel heavy, sometimes also my sinuses, but more often my lower jaw. Sometimes, she would feel pain in her left ear. Her lymph nodes on the left side of my face became swollen. Her doctor on Zoom said it sounded like a form of Bell&#39;s Palsy (medically significant), though she does not have the drooping eye or mouth. She had an MRI of her left lymph node that did not reveal any issues. Her symptoms, while they have abated, are still present five weeks after the shot. The events started on 26Feb2021 13:30. No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event left eye felt dry was recovered while other events was not recovered.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 09:40 (Lot Number: EN6199) (at the age of 65 years old) as single dose (dose 1) for COVID-19 immunisation; and methylprednisolone (MEDROL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at short term increase of the Medrol dose (as reported), from  unspecified date to an unspecified date at 2 mg (for four years, as reported), then from unspecified date to 10Mar2021 at 6 mg, then from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021 at 8 mg, then from 14Mar2021 to unspecified date at 6 mg, for Lupus. Medical history included diagnosed with asthma initially exercised induced and now it is seasonal and was diagnosed years ago (states she has not had to use her Albuterol inhaler that much now because it is seasonal but she is doing more outside and is allergic to outside things so she tends to use the inhaler more if needed), right leg paresthesia (she did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine), autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder and patient stated that she has lost height. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus. She had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 1st dose and then three days later on 10Mar2021 at 16:00, she thought what is going on and had her tongue tip so irritated and a strange feeling that it was a tiny bit edematous, her lower lip was full tingling. She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn&#39;t swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red. The next morning on 11Mar2021, her upper lip was tingling and she did go see her healthcare professional in town and sent photos to her Rheumatologist. As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn&#39;t catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn&#39;t see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Events required a visit to physician office (No visit to the ER but did see her physician). The last action taken in response to the events for methylprednisolone was unknown. The outcome of the event had left clavicle pain under the clavicle was recovered on 12Mar2021; event has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red was recovered in Mar2021; outcome for the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 based on strong temporal association, but possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications cannot be completely ruled out.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Mostly gone within 30 min. Went home. Left side of Parotid started swelling - at 12/24/2020 in the morning. I didn&#39;t notice anything wrong until I tried to eat breakfast. Very painful. Swelled up very large. Couldnt&#39; eat much for four days when I finally saw my dr (28th). and he gave  a prescription: an antibiotic and that started helping. When I  salivated it would start to swell. Pain was worse the first day and I massaged it alot to force saliva out of the grand. Tried to eat for very bland and very little on one side of mouth. Augmentin  Amox-Clad 875 mg. was the antibiotic I was given and that took about 24 hours to help.

                                                Swelling in face at temples where I had filler a year ago; right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Illness at vaccine included urinary tract infection from Jan2021 and ongoing. Medical history included face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection from 04Jan2021 to 11Jan2021. The patient had historically gotten shingles vaccine, flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine and never had any problems. The patient experienced swelling in face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019) and right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed on 10Jan2020 17:00. This consumer had the bnt162b2 on 10Jan2021 at about 12:30pm. On 10Jan2021 around 4:00 pm (reported as &#34;10Jan2020 05:00 pm&#34;) she noticed the areas around her temples and under eyes where she had filler placed last year swelled up quite a bit. She read up on this and saw to take antihistamines or oral steroids for this, so she took antihistamines and the event improved, was much better through during the day yesterday (11Jan2021). Last night (11Jan2021) her right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; in response to that event she has been icing the area and the event has improved, swelling come down quite a bit but still ongoing. She called her primary care physician about this event and is waiting for a callback from them about getting a steroid pack. She already reported this information on an unknown Pfizer website online, and also on the VAERS reporting online site today (12Jan2021); but does not have any reference numbers from those reports to provide at this time. She called to ask for information on how to proceed regarding this event; if this has been reported with bnt162b2; if there would be problems with her getting the second dose of bnt162b2 as scheduled on 31Jan2021 because she heard the second dose would be worse. She also noted during this report that she was still taking nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection when she received that first dose of bnt162b2; she asked if that could have any correlation with event or be a problem taken together. She reported by the time she got that first dose the urinary tract infection itself was gone. Caller verified that she received no other vaccines on the date of first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she had not received any other vaccines in the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she has no history of any adverse events with any other vaccines. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                At about 4:15 pm which is 3.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced tightness, swelling in my throat, tingling, numbness of my face in around my mouth, red flushing of the skin in my upper chest and throat.  I took 2 Benedryl tablets and experienced symptoms for the next hour. They subsided by 5:30 pm . I was able to breathe and swallow during the whole episode. I had very similar reactions several times in June when I was for unknown reasons experiencing hives and had same response when prescribed Bactrim, and then Keflex because of a UTI. I had no further incidents with the chest, throat, mouth reaction since mid June until yesterday.  I had no adverse reaction to the vaccine until 3.5 hrs after receiving it. I feel this is because my body has some sensitivity, not that anything was done incorrectly in administration of the vaccine. All personnel were very attentive and careful that I observed.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Cholesterol and Blood pressure, patient stated she took low dose medication for her blood cholesterol and blood pressure, but has had no new medications. She had a history of some allergies: a slight shrimp and scallops allergy, possible peanuts, penicillin, and a Neomycin product. She said they were not a big deal, and she had environmental allergies as well. She had an allergic reaction to the eye drop Neomycin, possibly, just the eye drop, she had a little breakout around her lips but she didn&#39;t know if it was the drug or not. The allergy to shrimp and scallops showed up in a blood test, her reaction to peanuts around her mouth but she had a negative scratch test and blood test for allergy to peanuts. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient stated she did get the flu vaccine, that was ok, she was fine, this was probably around Nov2020 or so, though she didn&#39;t know off hand when she got it, it was the regular flu vaccine and not an increased dose. The patient experienced arm discomfort on 17Jan2021, itching to eyes, mouth, and throat an hour after vaccination on 17Jan2021 12:00. The patient took the first shot yesterday (17Jan2021) and she had some discomfort to her arm, but it didn&#39;t bother her. She got the shot about 11:00 yesterday (17Jan2021) and about an hour after the shot she had some itching to her eyes, mouth, and throat that was not severe then was on and off through the day. She would like to know if this is common, she would like the information for the second dose, if she should expect more or less or same, she was concerned about the second dose. She did not have a severe reaction, she just wanted to make sure there weren&#39;t any adverse reaction for that make sure she known. She had not seen a doctor for her itching eyes, mouth, and throat. She didn&#39;t do any treatment for it, it was better today (18Jan2021), she just noticed it an hour after the injection that she felt a bit of eyes being itchy and all over, her mouth and throat were not severe, but she definitely felt it through the day. She felt it a little at night sometimes anyway like a dry throat. It was gone this morning and her arm was better, it seemed like the itching went with the arm things since following her arm soreness her itchiness started, then when her arm felt better the itchy was going away. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

I got up, drank some water and layed back down. After about 15-20 minutes the pain subsidded and I was able to fall back to sleep.  Just weird! Odd side effect for sure. Hope the second shot is that simple too!

                                                Message from patietn:  Due to other vaccine reactions I had to wait for 30 minutes after my shot.  All was okay, until I got in the car to drive home.  My tongue began to tingle and headaches began.  I immediately took an antihistamine as a tingly tongue for me is a sign of an allergic reaction.  I then had a band like pain across my upper back, and then the chills, tiredness, nausea, sore throat, sore arm which are all normal reactions from the printed information - well except for the tingly tongue and a red rash across my nose, cheeks and chin.  Tingling and rash subsided about an hour after taking the antihistamine, but all of the other symptoms remained.  My shot was at 1:50 PM and just before 11 PM I had instant onset of pain in my chest wall with breathing.  It went across the top of both breasts in the center where my ribs meet my sternum.  This has lessoned with laying down, but when I am up and about it increases although not as bad as last night.  I am also experiencing bursts of itchy spots all over.  As I have an EpiPen I did not  go to hospital but am wondering about what to do for the 2nd shot.  I think it will be best if I take an antihistamine prior to the shot and I will continue taking them for this one until my symptoms go away.

                                                About 24 hours after the 2nd dose, I had extreme nerve sensitivity on the left side of the face. This pain and sensitivity to touch went from my forehead above the eyebrow down to my chin. It included my left eye. It also seemed to affect my throat. The left gland popped and the left side of my throat was very sore.   This issue responded somewhat to Advil but never fully went away and only dissipated for about an hour in between Advil doses.   It lasted about 30 hours.   I hadn&#39;t read or heard anything about a reaction like this so wanted to provide the information.

                                                Before I left the hospital parking lot I could taste the   drug in my moth.  By the time I got home I had the dry heaves.  I was also alternating hot and cold.   This went from about 7 pm to 8 AM the next day.  That  day I had a head ache which I normally do not have.

I have had up 7 more since then and after my 2nd vaccine.  Dr. thought it might be related since I have no history of chronic migraines.  All past were over 16 years ago and related to hormonal changes.

She was instructed to contact her PCP for further evaluation. She was informed her second vaccine will have to be administered at an ER or facility that provides higher level of care. She was escorted to her vehicle to meet her husband.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021. She called her doctor on Monday and was seen by her doctor on Tuesday, 09Feb2021. The patient was referred to the eye center. Her headache was getting a little better. On 10Feb2021, the patient was seen at an institution, her retina and macula looked good, so she was referred to the ED. The patient was told she probably had a stroke. The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown. The has trouble reading now since the stroke.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to the vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent or underlying medical conditions in this elderly patient with excessive weight (BMI=29) and underlying elevated cholesterol. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

She woke up feeling well and then quickly became disoriented and vomited. She was then unable to walk or communicate appropriately. Emergency services was called and she was transported to Emergency room. She was diagnosed with a posterior brain CVA and was treated with tpa and now remains hospitalized in the ICU with expressive aphasia and vision loss.

Initially Atarax  one every 6 hours plus anti itch creams (Sarna - Gold Bond) then Zyrtec for three days . I discontinued all anti itch lotion and applying only aloe vera gel. Warm showers help. Itching seems to have decreased only slightly. Strangely it flares up after a meal. I drink a lot of water and feel very thirsty.

I quickly learned I could not taste or smell anything.  This went on for 5 days.  Very nauseated and my pain medicine I take was not holding 6 hrs.  My body pain was magnified x10.  I had a hard time staying awake and no appetite.  My Dr. office said they had this reported to them from other patients.  I don&#39;t know if I am to get the second vaccine as no one is getting back to me.

The pain moved from left to right in the throat. Also and worse: swollen mouth tissue and gums: agonizing. Lymph nodes in neck very sensitive to touch.  *****This was strange because at the beginning of the pandemic, I had these same symptoms three times: March 10, March 22, and April 28. I had a Covid test after 3rd time and it was negative. Consulted with doc, could not go to office for swab of throat because might be Covid. Had Covid test, negative. Started Amoxicillin for one week. Am feeling better.

On inside of lips there were more blisters. It started affected eating. My mouth was on fire. I realized it was another shingles outbreak - I have a standing prescription for shingles since I&#39;ve had shingles before  - Valacyclovir  HCL - 1 gram tablet  - I took two pills a day - 12 hours apart. Taking these: inflammation went down first and then blisters started going away - it took about two weeks. The herpes stays in my system but the outbreak is gone.

                                                Continuous Post nasal drip started right after vaccine and has not gone away after 11 days.  Also, my body is bloated and that has not gone away.  I was very thirsty after the vaccine so I drank a lot of water.  The bloat does not seem to be lessening.  It is very uncomfortable.  I don&#39;t want to get the second dose of the vaccine if this does not go away as I am afraid it will get worse.    Although you do not have that as a side effect of the vaccine there are a lot of other symptoms you do not have but I have heard many people say they get these symptoms after the vaccine.  You do not make it easy for people to report their symptoms so how are you keeping track of the symptoms people are experiencing after the vaccine.  Most older people are not computer literate and even though I am it was not easy to find out how to report these symptoms.  They gave me some way of reporting it by text message but I have an older phone and it won&#39;t work on that.  Most older people would not report symptoms on a phone....they are too small.  I also have an ipad but it does not do text messages.  I suggest you find another way to track symptoms after the vaccine or you are not getting accurate information.  This is not the way to do science.

                                                Today at about 11: 30 AM, I took an Amoxicillin for gingival irritation. I have taken this medicine before , but this was the first time since getting my Covid Vaccine. About one hour later, I began having intense itching of both hands, followed by diffuse flushing and pruritus and slight swelling around my face and eyes and a little feeling of throat irritation, but without SOB, wheezing or tongue swelling. My vital signs stayed stable, including a normal oximeter reading.  I took a 180 mg  Fexofenidine and used some OTC Hydrocortisone Cream on my hands when the first symptoms started. When the other symptoms progressed , I took 24 mg Methylprednisolone oral tablets and 25 mg liquid Diphenhydramine and my husband drove me to the ER, to be close in case I developed difficulty breathing.  After about 30 minutes the symptoms stopped worsening and gradually resolved. I didn&#39;t go to ER

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 66-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The vaccination facility type was a health clinic. The vaccine was not administered at a facility. The patient had no additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Medical history included ongoing seizures from 1982 (began shortly after she had the surgery for her brain aneurysm (in 1982 to 1982). The patient had not had any seizure activity for 20 years before the seizures that occurred on 13Mar2021. Sometimes electrical activity in the brain hits the metal clamp used to treat the brain aneurysm and that triggers the seizures); migraines (suffered from migraines when she was younger but hasn&#39;t had one in umpteen years. The patient gets tension headaches like most people but not very often); shingles (patient had shingles three times. Patient&#39;s first case of shingles was in the early 1990&#39;s and that patient had recurrences in the mid 1990&#39;s and the early 2000&#39;s. The first incidence was the worst and that the second and third occurrences weren&#39;t nearly as bad as the first); blood pressure high; ongoing cholesterol; ongoing headache (tension headaches) and was adopted. Family history included migraines with grandkids, a couple of them had migraines and had MRI&#39;s she&#39;d had a sister that was 6 years older than her that had died of a brain aneurysm. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA) for seizures from an unspecified date (in the late 90&#39;s) to an unspecified date then from Mar2021 and ongoing; nadolol for headache from 2001 and ongoing; lovastatin for cholesterol from an unspecified date (been on it for a long time) and ongoing and on a low dose of medication for high blood. The patient had the Pfizer vaccine first shot on Friday (12Mar2021). The husband stated his wife (patient) had a possible side effect to the vaccine shot and was concerned with getting the second dose of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine. She had 2 seizures the next morning after the shot (on 13Mar2021) which she hasn&#39;t had in 20 years. The patient experienced her first seizure about 11:00 on 13Mar2021. It took the patient about 45 minutes to come out of the first one completely, until she was conscious again. The second seizure occurred about 13:00 on 13Mar2021, about an hour and a half after the patient recovered from the first seizure. fter the second seizure, the fire department was called and she was transported to the Emergency Room. The doctor told the husband that it was up to them if they wanted to receive the second dose. The husband stated, &#34;I know there is something out there that I heard about where you can disqualify yourself from getting the vaccine for medical reasons.&#34; Also on 13Mar2021, the patient&#39;s tongue hurts in the Emergency Room, no one was willing to give her a new tongue after she bit it. The patient&#39;s tongue was what hurt&#39;s the most, but that it was slowly healing. The patient seemed to be fine since Saturday. he patient&#39;s father was really persistent about them getting the Covid-19 vaccinations. A CT scan and blood work were performed while she was in the Emergency Room on 13Mar2021 and reported that everything was fine. The patient went to the emergency room on 13Mar2021 and physician office on 17Mar2021 as a result of the seizure activity on 13Mar2021. On 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 130/82 with blood work with result of everything was fine. The patient went to her physician on 17Mar2021 due to concern about getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. When asked about prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient stated that she didn&#39;t want to get the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine because she&#39;s never even had the flu shot. The patient stated that back in 1977 when they first came out with the flu shot, she was unable to receive the vaccine as she was pregnant and she has never gotten the flu. The patient reported that she was unable to get MRIs due to the metal clamp in her. Patient reported that the clamp in her head was metal, not surgical metal, and that she has to be very careful because getting an MRI could kill her. The patient reported that next the day (in Mar2021) her arm was so hot that she could have roasted a weenie over her arm and it was very swollen. The patient reported that she went to urgent care and was told that it was an allergic reaction. The patient also reported that she got shingles again after receiving the vaccination. The husband considered the case as non-serious. The patient recovered from seizure with associated disease recurrence on 13Mar2021; for tongue pain was recovering while for the remaining events was unknown.

A currently 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 02Mar2021 16:00 (also reported as 16:30) (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 66-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bell&#39;s palsy from 07Jan2015; and an unspecified risk factor. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not have any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient did not have family medical history that was relevant to adverse events and no relevant tests were done. The patient previously took shingles vaccine (Merck) that started with the letter &#39;Z&#39; and had Bell&#39;s Palsy in Jan2015 which was exactly 6 weeks after she got a shingles vaccine; tetanus vaccines 10 years ago as a booster and experienced severe swelling on her arm, swelling in her body; Quadravalent flu vaccine and never had a reaction to the flu vaccines; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (reported as &#39;Pfizer COVID&#39;) for COVID-19 immunisation on 02Feb2021 in the left arm. On 24Apr2021, the patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy. On unspecified dates, the patient experienced fever blisters, ear ache and stress. The events were reported as follows: Her HCP should have the information on the shingles vaccine she got in 2015. When she had bell&#39;s palsy the 1st time in 2015, she had to go to the hospital for a day and a half to rule out everything and the best they found was that she had herpes simplex based on the blood work done at that time and it was what her HCP believed it was at that because it showed she had some kind of virus but neither time she had bell&#39;s palsy did she have seizure or other symptoms other than the ear ache she had this time. The patient got the second dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and on 24Apr2021 she went to the emergency room with Bell&#39;s palsy. She can talk better when she holds her mouth. She was out of town when she noticed the symptoms of bell&#39;s palsy the night before on 24Apr2021 and when she got home she then went to the emergency room on 25Apr2021; she could tell something was happening again and it was noticeable and she had an ear ache the day before and her face was drooping. The HCPs swear there was no correlation between the vaccine and bell&#39;s palsy but she found this very coincidental. The patient stated that she would rather get bell&#39;s palsy again than get covid. For treatment, the only thing she has done was to call the HCP to schedule the follow-up visit as directed by the emergency room (ER) HCP; she went to the ER to rule out stroke and they did rule out stroke; states the only other thing she can think of is that she had quite a bit of stress because they put down her dog on Sunday and other than that she had an ear ache at her granddaughter&#39;s track meet on the day before on 24Apr2021 and the emergency room visit was on 25Apr2021. She has had recurrent fever blisters and her HCP has given her a prescription for Valcyclovir and she takes that at the onset of fever blisters and where she gets the fever blisters is constantly on the previous side where she had bell&#39;s palsy and was in the same spot on her left side of her lip. States the Valcyclovir she has was one gram tablets and she takes one when she has a fever blister and one 12 hours later; states she has two prescriptions for the Valcyclovir and they are in orange pharmacy bottles with no lot numbers, expiry dates and NDC numbers and the other prescription for Valcyclovir is also 1 gram and she takes it three times per day now after this outbreak. The patient required a visit to the ER or medical doctor office. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

                                                arm is sore; Fatigue; eyes are still heavy; a metallic taste in her mouth; sleepy/eyes are still heavy/she is yawning a lot more; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose in her left arm for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no investigation assessment. It was reported that it had been 24 hours, she received her first bnt162b2 (reported as Pfizer COVID vaccine), yesterday (on 06Jan2021), and she was wondering, her arm was sore on 07Jan2021, which she thought was normal and fatigue on 06Jan2021, she got right away, she didn&#39;t know if that was normal, but she got a metallic taste in her mouth on 06Jan2021. It felt like a metallic taste when she swallows, a little metallic taste, yesterday (on 06Jan2021) was more than today, it was after the vaccine, about 7 hours after. She thought in her head, like the aluminum chewing gum, when kids chew it, it had a metallic taste, like the (company name withheld) wrapper she used to chew on it. Provides she was shrinking. Provide she was wearing stretch pants when providing weight. She Googled and didn&#39;t see the metallic taste, the only thing she saw with metallic taste is if you have the actual virus, she didn&#39;t have it, she was fine. Maybe it was all in her head. Arm was sore not right away, it built up, like when you stretch like with the flu shot, she lifted and it&#39;s sore, and she felt sleepy. It was like with the flu shot, it took a few days to go away. Last night on 06Jan2021, she was very sleepy, she was kind of sleepy, but it could be watching the Capitol and insanity, but she was yawning a lot more, her eyes felt heavy, she was ok, she had an appetite and is fine, she would drink (company name withheld) now. Thought she was peaking with it, she would go to sleep early today (07Jan2021), her eyes were still heavy, she wanted to close them and took a nap, but couldn&#39;t. It was like her saliva has a metallic taste in her mouth, it may be in her head, she googled to see side effects and when they start, it may be going soon, who knows, she was just wondering. The taste was worse yesterday (06Jan2021), and it wasn&#39;t IV or anything like that, the patient wanted to know how can that be. She had to go back on the 27th for her second dose. She had been tested and retested on an unspecified date, and it was offered for those 65 and over, and she was lucky to get an appointment. The outcome of the event metallic taste was recovering; the events fatigue and eyes heavy was not recovered; the outcome of the rest events was unknown.

                                                An hour after the vaccine, my lower lip started swelling and feeling puffy. It got worse and the inside of my mouth started feeling more puffy and full. I called my doctor. He directed to go to the Emergency Department right away. Since I&#39;m allergic to Benadryl, my doctor wanted to make sure I&#39;d be OK. I was treated with 40 mg of oral Prednisone and given a prescription to continue taking 20 mg daily for the next 3 days. The Emergency Department doctor recommended that I do not take the 2nd dose, but I wondered if I was on Prednisone the day of the next shot if I&#39;d be safer? The ER doctor thinks the next reaction of a swelling lip/mouth could be more intense after the 2nd dose. I will follow up with my internist. I&#39;ve had a mild swelling of my lip a few times in my life after eating something with artificial preservatives.

The other reaction, the one I am concerned about is that my bottom lip began to swell. The swelling continued throughout the night, swelling 3x normal size. It began to recede back to normal within 48 hours. Also, my lymph nodes under my right arm ( the injection arm) was very sore for 48 hours as well.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for self. This 67-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via intramuscular on 29Dec2020 around 10AM at left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergic to penicillin. She also had an allergy to anesthesia but was told this was irrelevant to the shot, this allergy was over 20 years ago. Ongoing acid reflux, she had a problem with acid reflux for a year (it was controlled on medication) but they made changes to her medication and started to come back. She stated it was not real bad and that this wasn&#39;t a side effect because she has been dealing with it for a year. Concomitant medications were none. No other vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient stated she received her first dose of the vaccine and didn&#39;t have any problem with it, just that her arm was sore and ached but by the next morning it was gone. The arm soreness happened maybe 12 hours later after she took the shot. She didn&#39;t experience it immediately after getting the injection. The soreness lasted overnight and by mid morning of 30Dec2020, she recovered completely. She stated this morning (18Jan2021) she woke up with a sore throat and her ear started to throb and she asked if it is safe for someone to receive the second dose if they are not feeling their very best? She is scheduled for her next dose tomorrow.  The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Patient stated she was not sure about her weight because she lost a lot of weight dealing with the acid reflux she had had lately. Lab data included she had two COVID tests because of work previously, but these were negative. The outcome of arm soreness was recovered on 30Dec2020, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information on the LOT/Batch number has been requested.

Lips became tingly and numb. Throat and tongue became tingly and numb. At 11:50 we had returned to clinic. 50 milligrams of Benadryl were administered. Blood pressure 120 over 60 (a bit high for me but anxiety accounts for that) . Pulse 60- normal for me. After being observed for one hour symptoms diminished and we left clinic. After 2 more hours all symptoms gone.

                                                face got even hotter/her face felt warm; mild allergic reaction; scalp itchiness moved to the back of her neck down the middle of her back; eyes started to itch; arm soreness/it felt like a bruise; arm soreness/it felt like a bruise; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer(patient). The 67-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 20Jan2021 14:05 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hot flashes, Cholesterol, clear her lungs, eyes(disorder), hair(disorder), high cholesterol, heart(disorder), arthritis in hip and knee, face felt warm from 2015, quit smoking, back pain. In 2015 she had a reaction to a cortisone shot in her knee and experienced her face felt warm.  She got a spinal epidural last Jan2020, she had gone to an allergist prior to the spinal epidural to take a five hour test for allergy to dexamethasone and had a very mild reaction with face warming so she did get the spinal. When she got a flu shot her arm would be sore when she moved it. Her last flu shot(Infs Fluarix Quadrivalent) was on 24Sep2020 at his 67-year-old. she usually didn&#39;t have issues with vaccines but she was going to make herself wait the 30 minutes due to her weird reactions. She had a lot of weird reactions to medications and always had to wait 30 minutes for Penicillin and sulfa. Penicillin put her in a coma for two days when she was 7 years old. She has never had penicillin since then. with Sulfa she got an immediate rash and itching but that was 20 years ago. She couldn&#39;t take pain killers and lots of other medications including clindamycin; Neurontin; gabapentin; carbamazepine; endocet; metoprolol; tamalor. The pain medication issue happened in 2003 and the metoprolol issue happened in 2008. Ongoing concomitant medication included aloe vera for hot flashes and GERD, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) for high cholesterol and heart, biotin for hair, cod liver oil to clear her lungs(like a heart supplement), famotidine for GERD, chondroitin sulfate sodium/glucosamine (GLUCOSAMINE AND CHONDROITIN) for arthritis in hip and knee, lansoprazole for GERD, latanoprost for eyes, lovastatin for blood cholesterol, xantofyl (LUTEIN) for eyes , zeaxanthin from 21Jan2021 for eyes and multivitamins(women over 50) for supplement.  On 20Jan2021, the patient experienced a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine, only had a mild reaction, she had a mask on and when she got in the car and took off the mask, her face felt warm; Her reaction(face getting warm) was similar to what she experiences with a cortisone shot and dexamethasone before. The face feeling warm happened about 35 minutes after the vaccine(20Jan2021 14:40), then she got home and her face got even hotter; her scalp started to itch, it was really itchy; her eyes started to itch and then the scalp itchiness moved to the back of her neck down the middle of her back for about 2 hours. All of the itchiness went away after about three hours or 17:00PM on 20Jan2021; then a little bit of the scalp itching came back for about 45 minutes and then went away. All of the itching has been gone since evening on 20Jan2021. Later that night on 20Jan2021, she noticed she had a little bit of arm soreness; it felt like a bruise; when she laid on it hurt. 21Jan2021 it had gone away, too. The arm soreness wasn&#39;t even as bad as the flu shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine 10Feb2021. Outcome of arm soreness/it felt like a bruise was recovered in 21Jan2021, of other events was recovered on 20Jan2021.

Patient called the next day (2/11/21) @ 0927 and reported swelling on left side of face and lips and denied any SOB or difficulty swallowing.  Patient came into office to be assessed by Doctor; Assessment and Plan angioedema-adverese reaction to 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine, mild and should subside spontaneously. Recommend Benadryl OTC for swelling. Regarding future covid vaccines not enough information for specific advice, however would presume she would never take this particular vaccine again, not sure about a different type/brand.

                                                hearing loss/Cannot hear in right ear very well; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high. Concomitant medication included levamlodipine besilate for blood pressure high. On 27Jan2021, the patient experienced hearing loss in the right ear, she started to feel like she could not hear very well in her right ear. It was like she was underwater or something. Patient went to see the family doctor on 31Jan2021 because of her ear and the doctor looked in ear and did not see anything wrong. The doctor prescribed an allergy medication, something basic that could be picked up over the counter.

                                                Blurred vision, benign vertigo, immediately after vaccine given.  Corrected itself over the next hour. But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

Is on medications for that which help.  With the injection this sensation worsened within the last day or two.  Spoke with her doctor who told her to increase her medications as it can exacerbate after a vaccine.  She still having the symptoms and has an APT with her PCP this afternoon.

Got home in about 15 minutes.  Once home, I drank some water.  Slowly the tingling of the tongue and roof of mouth disappeared.

This 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 09:55 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient got her first injection of the COVID-19 vaccine on 26Jan2021 at 09:55AM in her left arm. Patient said that the diarrhea just started on 26Jan2021, she had tried calling earlier and had to hang up because of it, maybe because she was nervous. Patient said that she tasted the vaccine constantly, she has been experiencing a bad taste in her mouth, she couldn&#39;t stand the taste. Patient couldn&#39;t get rid of the taste. She said beforehand she was scared of anaphylactic shock, but she was having the taste in her mouth and diarrhea. She said she had the taste of the vaccine in her mouth and throat on 26Jan2021. She said that everything that she eats she is trying to get taste out of her throat. Patient has done no treatment yet for the diarrhea or the taste in her mouth. She said that her arm didn&#39;t hurt afterwards and she didn&#39;t feel the shot, and now she can&#39;t touch her arm without it hurting though she has been moving her arm a lot. She said she knew that from the flu shot, but that never hurt her, this thing was sore (sore arm) on 26Jan2021. She said she wasn&#39;t worried about that though, she just wanted to know if the taste would go away, and if it was normal. She said that there was nothing that said anything about diarrhea either, and she was not sick, she didn&#39;t feel sick, there was just the taste. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Then I started to have tightness in my chest and used my albuterol inhaler.   I was still having symptoms an hour later so took Benadryl 25 mg.  During the night I woke up with mild wheezing and used my inhaler again.  Throughout the next 2 days, I continued to have these symptoms (except for wheezing) off and on.  Today, I still have some symptoms but not as often or severe.

A 67-years-old female received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9269),  via an unspecified route of administration on 07Feb2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 Vaccination. Medical history included ongoing asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, seasonal allergy  (told  to take Zyrtec for seasonal allergies prophylactically). Facility in which the vaccine was received was a clinic at a high school through the local hospital. Concomitant medication included fluticasone propionate, salmeterol (WIXELA INHUB), glipizide (GLIPIZIDE).  On 07Feb2021,  the patient received the first dose and while  walking  to the observation area (about two minute after receiving the vaccine)  the patient  experienced  very very  intense headache, felt an ungodly pressure in my head, vision was off, and trouble concentrating.

Physician recommended she make sure to take her inhalers, for asthma and told me to take Zyrtec (for seasonal allergies) ahead of time. Consumer inquired if she should receive the second dose.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood cholesterol: little high 207 on Feb2021, blood thyroid stimulating hormone: normal  on Feb2021,  electrocardiogram: normal  on Feb2021, full blood count: normal  on Feb2021, hemoglobin: 6.9 on Feb2021, heart rate: 100 bpm on Feb2021, heart rate: 102 bpm  on Feb2021, metabolic function test: Alt high  on Feb2021.

                                                Immediately after medicine went in my arm I felt a warm flush from my neck all the way to my toes (the same as when I have had radioactive dye),    during my 15 minutes of observation my hands and feet were cold and sweaty and I felt a little shaky.  I waited 20 minutes and went to the restroom and had diarrhea (very rare for me).  I went to my car and looked in the mirror and my face was bright red and  the whites of my eyes were red and my eyes were glassy.  I went back in to the observation area and was given oral Benadryl. and monitored for 45 minutes.  Right after I took the Benadryl my throat felt itchy (not sore - itchy).  My blood pressure was 157/62 when I first sat down but came down to 130/ 60 by the time I was sent home.  My bp is normally about 106/60.   I was really tired at home for the rest of the day so went to be early.  The next day I felt fine and my arm was only slightly sore.  The doctor at the immunization clinic told me not to get the 2nd shot.  I called my GP,  and he too told me not to get the 2nd COVID shot and wait until more information has come out about adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did not have any difficulty breathing.  I don &#39;t know if the redness on my face went down my neck to my chest.  I didn&#39;t look.  I did not have a fever.

Has not stopped since day after injection and worried it will last forever. Very distressing. No where is this listed as side effect and yet on internet people are complaining about it. This should be brought to public&#39;s attention so a correct decision can be made on whether to go ahead for vaccine. I will not be getting the second dose for fear this will get even worse. Ruining my days and nights.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

                                                Violent entire body chills approximately 12 hrs after vaccine.  Chills lasted an hour with 3 blankets and heating pad. Then switched to fever for next 8 hours. Fever recorded 102 the only time I checked. Nausea, body aches, plugged nose making it slightly difficult to breathe, headache, and exhaustion. Unable to sleep through the night due to fever, aches, and breathIng discomfort.  Slept off and on all following day.  Able to eat minimally at dinner next day.  Strong taste of food, ie chicken soup seemed way strong. Third day tired but appetite slightly returning and other side effects seem subsided.

                                                On 3/4 patient received 1st dose of COVID vaccination. She states that she drove home afterward and decided to sit and watch TV. She immediately began noticing that the words on her TV screen were not legible - her vision had become blurry. This blurriness was accompanied by severe eye pain and pain in the temples of her head. When shutting eyes and keeping them closed for a few hours, the blurriness would subside. However she continues to experience this blurriness &#39;on and off&#39; to date. Also experienced some mild headaches but they have subsided as of two days ago. Hasn&#39;t taken anything to alleviate the symptoms. Patient is extremely concerned that she may permanently lose vision and refuses to get 2nd dose.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL267, expiry date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 67-year-old, on 24Feb2021, as SINGLE DOSE (0.3mi as reported) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus and ongoing allergy to penicillin. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EL9265, expiry date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration, on 03Feb2021, single dose for covid-19 immunisation wherein the patient had to got to Emergency room and it was found that her magnesium and potassium were low. The patient had a super bad reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. Patient&#39;s mind has not been normal ever since and she is so mean to everybody. The patient was fine until she got the vaccine. The reporter has had the ambulance and police up there to try and help but the caller wouldn&#39;t go out to the hospital. The patient had a normal mind before she got the shot. The patient has a bad headache that will not go away (8 days) and her eyes are hurting really bad/eye pain/ eyes hurt. She feels so tired and weak. The second COVID-19 Vaccine messed the patient up. She had the same symptoms for both first and second dose (unspecified symptoms), but the second dose has really messed up her mind. Patient probably won&#39;t have a mind. It was reported that the patient&#39;s mind was alright, but the second COVID-19 Vaccine did her in. Now patient is saying she won&#39;t get her mind back. It has messed up her mind. Clarified when caller states it messed up her mind, he is referring to the patient being mean. Stated patient did have a headache, but wasn&#39;t hateful. Stated patient&#39;s mind is so bad, she is just mean. If patient doesn&#39;t get help soon she is going to tell herself good night. Patient stated in background &#34;If I don&#39;t get my mind back I&#39;m going to end up killing myself because he made me.&#34; At 11PM last Wednesday (24Feb2021), patient starting losing her mind. Confirmed with caller that patient is currently having suicidal thoughts. Patient used to be a real nice lady and blames this on the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient is afraid she is not going to get her mind back. Advised caller to seek emergent medical attention for the patient. Patient is against everybody now because of the crazy COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient heard in the background stating the COVID-19 Vaccine screwed up her mind. Caller stated patient is quite upset with everybody. Patient is not acting normal.  Patient doesn&#39;t think her mind will ever get straightened. The medicine was too much for her body. After getting the second dose, the patient lost her mind, she&#39;s lost her appetite/ No appetite and went 32 hours without eating, can&#39;t think straight, altered state of mental, mental fog, pain in head and stomach, change of mood, nightmares, her eyes felt like they were going to pop out. Her doctor said it was probably an overdose. The patient was not like this prior to second dose. Outcome of the event was unknown. The reporter believes her mental fog is due to second dose of vaccine.

                                                I woke up, and could not get out of bed  because I was sick. Aches and pain on entire body, tired, malaise, and  sick.  Then I got the chills, accompanied with a fever. My everyday temperature is 96.7 and I had a 99.7 fever.  My eyes were glassy and grey.   I was like this until the next day.  I had COVID19 on 11/18/2020 - I did not have the above symptoms of aches and pains or a fever or the chills.  My breathing and coughing finally was 99% better by February 2, 2021. My taste and smell is not back yet. Are there studies on how people react to vaccination if they had the COVID19? Is there research comparing prior COVID19 symptoms with adverseReactions symptoms?

Back pain near kidney developed a week after vaccine. 4.  Thirsty and for 3 days unquenchable thirst. 5.  Had spurts of joint pain all over for several days. Did not have these symptoms with 1st vaccine, this has been progressing for 2 weeks, as of tomorrow, and got worse as time passed. I am very active and healthy and this has certainly impacted my routine.  I still work. Visit to Dr. about back pain resulted in negative test and Dr. blamed it on vaccine.

                                                About 3 days after the first vaccination I started to notice a  slight humming or buzzing in my ears at night.  Mostly noticeable when I go to bed not enough after the first shot to keep me from sleeping so didn&#39;t think much of it.  After the second shot it is  more noticeable even during the day.  Not so much to be disabling but I do notice it and I have never had this happen before.  I had normal side affects for first and second shots otherwise, sore arm, some fatigue and slight chills more so after the second shot as it these symptoms lingered for almost a week but nothing too severe and those are gone now but the humming/buzzing noise is still there in the background. Is there something I can do to help alleviate this or will it go away on its own?

                                                I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She received the first round of the vaccine (Pfizer/EL9269) on 2/18/21. That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                Started with loss of taste on Tuesday p.m.. Just after 4am, I awoke my husband because I was about to vomit. From there I was going in and out of consciousness. My husband took my temp and it was just over 104 degrees. He wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the ER, but I refused not realizing how bad off I was. This went on for about 4 hours. My husband applied ice cold wash cloths to my forehead and back of my neck for hours. He finally was able to bring my temp down some. I used the cold cloths for just over two days. I was so fatigued I was unable to walk without help. Had a bad headache too. My husband gave me Tylenol off and on for days. My fever finally broke on the 5th day. I am still left with bad fatigue and some headache.  Have also had diarrhea. My husband kept fluids in me which also included Ensure. I had terrible fever blisters on my lower lip and the inside of my mouth was sore. I am due to have my 2nd shot in about a week, but because I still have some lingering symptoms, was advised to not have 2nd shot.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

A 67 -year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 67 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

An ambulance was called, but her husband took her to the hospital because it was right across the street, because her doctor had advised her to get the shot at a site near the hospital because of her history of allergies. Caller reports that she was in the ER for like five and a half hours, and when she started to feel better, she said she wanted to go home and lay in her own bed if she is just going to be puking her guts out. Caller states that she went home and crashed and burned for a few days, with no voice, and she was still coughing to try and clear her throat, it felt like her throat was closing up. Caller confirms she was not admitted to the hospital for this reaction. All events started 04Mar2021. Treatment was given for all events. The outcome of the events was unknown. Caller had no other vaccines on the same day.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration in left leg on 20Feb2021 12:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, chronic urticaria, and known allergies. Concomitant medication in two weeks included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC). The patient was not pregnant and did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. She was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. On 20Feb2021 01.15 PM, the patient experienced hand swelling, rash on face, and lip swelling. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Hospitalization was also reported. Treatment included diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). Outcome of the events was recovering. Patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren&#39;t like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn&#39;t have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn&#39;t know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn&#39;t feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can&#39;t since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn&#39;t normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn&#39;t believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn&#39;t wake up with this eye shut. It wasn&#39;t pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn&#39;t feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don&#39;t really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn&#39;t have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can&#39;t the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn&#39;t really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided. She noticed that it comes and goes and sometimes she can eat and she is fine and sometimes she gets really sick feeling. It seems like if she doesn&#39;t eat then she doesn&#39;t get the symptoms but she knows that she needs to eat. Investigations: Her doctor has been having her do platelet blood tests about every 5 days since she took the COVID vaccine. She does not remember the dates of these tests off of the top of her head. She had a blood draw at the clinic the day before her COVID vaccine and her platelet count was 49 on 08Mar2021. For the result of 29 that was either last Thursday or last Friday, 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021. Te outcome of the event scleral discoloration was recovered on 13Mar2021, tiredness was recovered on 15Mar2021, headache was not recovered, pain in hip was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021299104 similar report from same reporter

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 67-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203, expiration date not reported), on towards side of muscle in right arm via intramuscular on 02Mar2021 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included female surgery (caller stated she takes Miralax regularly every other day for the last 5 years for a female surgery and her female surgeon says she needs it to stay out but the ingredient is also in Miralax. Caller then stated she knew it was not that ingredient causing the reaction), pneumonia (Caller stated she had the Pneumonia shot). Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (D3) at units everyday from an unspecified date and macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) taken for female surgery. The patient previously took zyrtec [cetirizine hydrochloride] for seasonal allergies like dust (Caller stated she usually takes Zyrtec for seasonal allergies like dust. Caller stated she took no Zyrtec at all for either shots) and received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EM9809), at the age of 67-years on bicep left arm upper muscle on 09Feb2021 14:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. On an unknown date the patient experienced skin reaction red rash under both armpits, soreness in arm, ears would get warm feeling very hot, swelling in arm, skin is dry from being inflamed. The report received as, Caller received the COVID vaccine and stated she had rosy red, inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly her bilateral armpits and then sometimes ears would get hot. She had second COVID 19 vaccine and also had first one. The first dose was on 09Feb2021 and she had swelling in arm after shot and has been using a cool cloth on it and was better by the next day. Caller then states she still feels it though and it has been five weeks. Caller states she tries to turn arm and can still feel it but it is not bad. Caller states a day later she had her first skin reaction which was a red rash under both armpits. She called primary care doctor and talked to nurse to see if she should try some other medication before second shot and the nurse recommended she should not get second shot that she should see an allergist. She got to building for second shot and talked to nurse there. She asked the nurse about the quality of first and second shot working together if she had waited and not got second shot. the nurse told her she would have to come back at least four days after the second shot was due or it would not work together. She went ahead and got the vaccine and it has not been life threatening as of now. She saw an allergist three days after second shot. She had rosy red inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly bilateral armpit and then sometimes ears would get hot. She would take Benadryl and her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. She took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for her for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra but the Benadryl seemed to help and her Allergist felt she made the right decision since her events are not life-threatening since it is not respiratory. The Allergist saw her armpits agreed the children Benadryl was working and that she should stick with that, but it is not going away been like this the whole time since 02Mar2021 and still having a reaction in her armpits, after the second shot the flare up was quicker because first shot was already in system still, it is not a flare up like when someone can not eat seafood and stuff like that. She still has a rosy armpit and probably will not see her HCP unless she gets bad but she will go to Allergist. She wanted to wait for second dose before contacting Pfizer to see what would happen. She is really blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters and her skin is dry from being inflamed all this time. She squeezes a rag under her armpits and that it is better during the day than at night, it is worse at night. She is only taking 20 mL of Benadryl in the morning and then evening before bed. The first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose. She hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. Since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face. Caller states her sister asked what did she did and she said nothing. Swelling in arm was from the first shot it was really hot like a boil but it was not red it just felt hot, she used a cold compress during the night like a washrag and by the next day it was fine. She got the shot on the left arm on purpose because she was left handed and could move it more but noticed the swelling stayed a while. When she got the second shot she asked the nurse to give in her back upper part of bicep in arm muscle since it was a better location and it did not swell up and it did not hurt. She can still feel exactly where she got the first shot. Swelling in arm was not terrible. her allergist felt she made the right decision since it is not life threating like respiratory related or closing of throat like food allergies just uncomfortable and annoying. Skin reaction red rash under both armpits was the event started the first day after the first shot then still having reaction from the second shot. She had the reaction a couple hours later and did wait half hour before leaving after getting the shot with the second shot she did not experience any swelling or soreness. The reason she went ahead and got the second shot at the medical building was she asked the nurse how many people had skin reaction before second shot. Ears would get warm feeling very hot, she only experienced it six times and it was usually at night or in the morning from the second shot. Every once in a it while flare up from the first. The hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit. Skin was dry from being inflamed from past couple of days her skin has been dry. She has used hand cream but is afraid to put anything else on it because of reaction. The serious criteria is just annoying. She will probably put cream on it so it does not crack, it is very dry and it has not been dry like this. she has been putting water on at night which could have dried it out. Some days is worse than others more red and this was persisting. The second shot is much better and that she does not feel it at all. She can still feel where the vaccine went in left arm. It is annoying but it does not keep her from moving her arm and it has been five weeks. Since it is not going away it is serious. The soreness had not gone away before she got the second shot so double whammy. She guesses right now it is uncomfortable and that she has had better days. She is not taking Benadryl in middle of day like before but it is itchy so she is going to go out in the cold and work in yard, before first week or two she would use cool compresses all day and take Benadryl during day and then at night it petered out. She is hoping it will fade out eventually. Caller stated that the seriousness criteria is medically significant. She is taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. She took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra. The medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. She only took one pill as it did not work. she had not had an an anaphylactic reaction yet. She is taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. Outcome of the events skin reaction red rash under both armpits, soreness in arm and skin is dry from being inflamed were not recovered and remaining events were unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

The biggest problem was that my eyes became strangely affected, like there were shutters being opened and closed in rhythmic waves inside my eyes. They were also very photosensitive and blurry. My whole head felt wrong. drove me home, (I could not have driven).  This lasted several hours. I had chills and stayed laying down with my eyes closed. By the end of the day I felt mostly recovered.  This series of events recurred 6 days later,  on Jan. 20th. This time it also lasted most of the day, but I continued feeling moderately unwell the next day, and today it continues. I feel weak and unsteady. My eyes are better but  not entirely. They ache and feel insecure. I am not currently feeling up to any activities besides resting.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

Reaction description by the reporter:&#34; I had no pain, slight headache. My blood pressure now is 137/93. It was high this morning when I talked with the triage nurse. I had the shot/vaccine (first dose) on Friday. I feel better today than yesterday. Friday I felt fine. I got symptoms yesterday. When I woke up yesterday. I was feeling a little woozy, I always stretch slowly in bed. I slowly raised myself on the bed but before I got up my torso fell backwards. I felt like I was fainting. The room was spinning. All day yesterday I did not drive. I walked very slowly. I was holding onto the wall. I felt lousy like I had the flu. I would lay down for 20 minutes, watching tv. My head was sideways and every time I would raise my head the room was spinning. Also there is not enough spit in my mouth. It is very dry. I had a slight headache. So I did not bother but no headache today. I supposed to get my 2nd dose on 02Feb2021. The action taken was not applicable. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

This 68-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unknown route, on 14Jan2021 (at 08:30) at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included orthostatic intolerance, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant concomitant medications included hydrocortisone (CORTEF), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), fludrocortisone acetate (FLUDROCORTISON) and pyridostigmine. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. On 14Jan2021, after vaccination, she began to feel unsteady, weak, lightheaded, chest tight, and dizzy. Her eyed began swimming with a sensation of shutters being opened and closed in front of her. She could not see very well, eyes were very photosensitive. Layed down and slept, rested in a dark room most of the day. She had also chills and headache. But nightfall she felt mostly recovered, although not very energetic. About one week later, on 20Jan2021, it all happened again, all at once. She also rested for the day and slowly recovered. But this time it hasn&#39;t all gone away.

                                                I got my COVID Vaccine shot on Friday, January 29th at 2:00 pm.  By  Sunday,January 31st at 5:00 pm I had a reaction to my Right Eye.  On Monday, February 1st I went to my Eye Doctor thinking I had something in my eye that I couldn&#39;t get out on my own.  It turned out I had developed an eye ulcer.  I have NEVER had any problems with my eyes before. I was put on 2 medicated eye drops (Durezol 2x daily for a week and Gatifoxacin 4x daily).  I had a follow up appointment one week later, February 9th and it was determined that the infection had deminished, but my eye was still dry and I needed to put drops  (Refresh Tears) in daily  for and additional week. I would like to report that this may have been a side effect from the shot.

The tongue felt thick, especially towards the back for 4-5 days and the back of my throat didn?t feel more ?normal? for at least 9-10 days.  It stills feels a little ?thicker? still but much better.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The pain went away in a couple of hours but the itching continued for 3 days. It woke me up from sleep 3 nights in a row. I took Zatidor eyedrops and Allegra with very little improvement.   I get similar eye symptoms with seasonal allergies but this was the worse I have ever experienced and was not accompanied by runny nose, sneezing or coughing which I usually get with seasonal allergies and this is not a typical season for my allergies this may be just a coincidence but since I have read that Covid 19 can give similar ocular symptoms I am concerned about my second dose.  I got a COvid test 2 days ago (no other symptoms) and do not yet have the results

                                                I had filler under my eyes, injected in mid-December 2020.  After Pfizer vaccine 2  my under eye area puffed up where the filler was placed and has remained puffed up now,   25 days after the 2nd shot.  No signs of resolving.  Has remained as it was on February 5th 2021 no change.  Not good.

Saw opthmologist prescribed Acyclovir.  Over a couple days swelling dissapeared and burning, itching subsided.  The thing is, I had my second COVID dose on 02/10/2021,  10:00AM Pitzer Lot #9581.  On 02/18/2021 late evening, started to feel burning in left eye nose area again, next morning eye swollen shut.  Saw Dr, said I was having an allergic reaction and put me on prednesone and Amoxicylin.  No reduction of swelling and burning, blisters were forming.  Went to Urgent Care on 2/20/2021 and was prescribed Acyclovir again.  Swelling now gone and itching burning diminished.

A 68-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on her left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (Diagnosed 3 to 4 years ago) and thyroid disorder. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine on Saturday and went home and fell asleep, woke up and had lumps in back of neck, they hurt, pain goes around into jaw, up into the face and ear hurts. The patient just tried a hot compress, a hot cloth on there, it seemed to help a little bit for a while. Took some Advil and that helped a little bit, but when it wears off it comes back. Adds she felt dizzy too, and still felt like that too, it started right after she got it, and it comes and goes. The outcome of the event dizzy was unknown while not recovered for the remaining events.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

She was trying to focus on a sign we had in the waiting room, and the words started blurring and doubling. BP was normal, heart rate was slightly elevated. With time (about 10 minutes), patient reported it was improving. We got patient to her feet first to ensure balance wasn?t effected and then patient reported she was ok to leave.

Treated in an ambulance at vaccine site with IV Benadryl, had some skin tingling, also given IV solumedrol and observed for almost 2 hours with no other symptoms. I was also hypertensive, probably due to anxiety.

My face was flushed and my throat began to tighten a little  The headache and flush lasted about an hour.  (I had taken Tylenol right after getting the vaccine.)  The throat symptoms lasted longer ,lessening slightly after about an hour and a half.  Never had trouble breathing, talking, eating or drinking.  But the feeling has lasted into the late evening to a very mild degree; as if something is caught at the back of the throat, or the back of the tongue feels a little fuzzy.

Also, around the same time, I developed a metallic taste in mouth that resolved quickly after drinking warm coffee. The lip/tongue issue was not concerning and resolved within an hour.  I do suffer from anxiety having experienced reactions to food and medicines although never anything severe.

EMS evaluated the patient on-site. Patient was hypertensive (173/92). EMS administered 50mg Benadryl IV and 2L Oxygen via nasal canula. Given past medical history of allergic reactions, EMS transported the patient to  Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient remained hypertensive. EKG demonstrated NSR, rate 75bom, no ST-T changes, no ectopy, and normal PR &amp; QRS intervals. Blood work was unremarkable. After administration of Benadryl the patient noted improvement of their hives and was discharged with a diagnosis of allergic reaction secondary to COVID vaccine that caused acute hives.

                                                Patient had some subjective tongue swelling after receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine today. She also experienced this after the first dose from lot #EM9809 on 02/16/2021 but did not bring it to anyone&#39;s attention at the time. She pre-dosed with 25mg of Benadryl today before receiving the vaccine. She was observed for over an hour without worsening before being discharged from the observation area with instructions to take an additional 25 mg Benadryl after returning home.

                                                Headache, aches within 8 hours. Within 20 hours developed severe vertigo and nausea. Movement caused room spinning and broke out in cold sweat. Severe vertigo continued through second day (Feb 22), but seemed to diminish somewhat toward evening. Day 3 still had moderate vertigo/nausea but better than previous day. Went on a long walk. Day 4 moderate vertigo/nausea continued. Tried doing Epley exercises for vertigo. Vertigo/nausea became severe again, so severe I vomited several times. After vomiting got the shakes and felt very cold. Checked blood pressure and it was very high (170/98), but pulse rate was in low 30s. After a few hours blood pressure and pulse rate became closer to normal. Almost decided to go to ER clinic, but decided to wait until my daughter came home from work because I was way too dizzy to drive. After I calmed down I decided it wasn&#39;t an emergency. Severe vertigo continued through evening of day 4. On day 4 I called primary care doctor to see if there was anything I could do for the vertigo. She prescribed meclizine, but hearing that it is an antihistamine, I declined it (antihistamines make my heart race and make me very anxious). Severe vertigo/nausea continued through day 5 and day 6. (Severe vertigo/nausea being that I could not move around at all other than to sit still staring forward without the room spinning.) All this period I also had a headache, a feeling of pressure through my whole head/sinus area, and my vision was blurred. I also felt as though I could not focus my eyes or concentration. I tried using some over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray for 2 days to relieve congestion in head, but they made me feel very anxious, so I stopped. I also tried taking some Aleve a couple of times. It helped a little, but made me feel woozy, so stopped. Day 6 the vertigo/nausea improved to moderate, but I could still not walk straight. I felt unsafe to drive. Day 7 continued to improve, but still moderate vertigo/nausea. Day 8 I noticed a lot of improvement in vertigo/nausea. Kept improving day 9. By evening on day 10 I was noticing a rawness and lump in the back of my throat. Called primary care office day 11 to see someone. Drove car, but felt marginally safe driving. Was diagnosed with a sinus infection and prescribed a 10 day course of Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (875-125 mg for 2 pills a day for 10 days). Felt improvement in throat and sinus over next few days. Day 15 I felt greatly improved with head ?fog? and vertigo. Had an appointment with an ENT clinic on day 15 to see what was causing vertigo. All tests were good for hearing, and visual examination of ears. Was checked for BPV but that was ruled out. Said vertigo was probably caused by viral infection or inflammation of vestibular nerve or canals. Recommended waiting for improvement and coming back if it persisted. Began doing more normal activities even though I still had mild vertigo. Day 16 felt still better in morning, then in afternoon bent over quickly to catch something and got a terrible wave of spinning again. Moderate/severe vertigo continued that evening. Improved to moderate on day 17 and 18. All along, when vertigo was worse, so was the ?fog? (blurry vision, inability to focus mentally). At day 19 I feel like I did on day 15, but I have noticed the pressure/lump around my ear and on left side of head is improved. Brain ?fog? is improved too, very mild and the vertigo is mild. I finish my antibiotic tomorrow.At present vertigo is not gone. Its mild today, but this is only one of maybe 2 1/2 days in which its been this mild (out of almost three weeks since I was vaccinated). I have been drinking a lot of water every day, and ginger tea when I get nauseous. I had my 2nd dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine scheduled for Mar 15. I?ve cancelled it and intend to wait to see how long it takes for vertigo to finally resolve before considering a 2nd dose.

I also noticed what I would describe as discomfort in the lymph system.  Also, I have difficulty thinking clearly.  Tasks that I  usually complete easily such as online banking have been more difficult.  I&#39;m making mistakes.  As I write this I am now three days from the inoculation.  I have burning pain under my right arm.  I have burning pain in tops of my feet.  My hip joints are stiff.  My eyes are sore.  I feel generally fatigued.  This is not my normal level of functioning.

Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck.

She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses.

ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis.

She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

                                                She received the vaccination, and almost immediately she started getting a numbing feeling on her left side  It started at her face, half her lip and into her jaw, and down her leg on the left side., the upper thigh/leg and the calf, down her feet into her toes.  There was just a slight numbness in her chest, she didn&#39;t think much of it as she had family members who had no reactions.  That subsided a little.  The feelings lasted all day Monday, all day Tuesday, got concerned yesterday Wednesday 3/17/21.  She called  the CDC and they transferred her to a nurse who told her to go see her doctor.  She called her doctor and she described her reaction and told her that they did not know if it was stroke-like and they told her to go to the hospital.  She went to the hospital yesterday and they did an exam on her and one of the doctors who consulted with his connections with the CDC and decided that they would have to do an MRI on her to make sure it did not cause a stroke.  She did have the MRI which they looked at it and told her that it looked clear and was not a stroke, however, she is to FU with a Neurologist and her PCP.  The only thing that she was given to try was something for allergies, Benadryl to see if that would help with the reaction.  She still has some feelings of numbness in the same areas as listed above.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 03Feb2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 68-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection; Batch/lot number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 15:55 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included allergy to all antibiotic and eggs. The patient had no family medical history relevant to event. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu shot in Sep2020 for immunization in which she had no reaction. The patient did not administered additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 28Jan2021, half an hour after the vaccination, the patient experienced a bad reaction-itching all over her body and her tongue was numb. She was still itching but was better; she has taken Zyrtec and all kinds of things for this event. The patient did not visit emergency room and physician office. The numb tongue had gotten better but then Monday it was numb again. She took more Zyrtec and it was better today. No relevant tests performed. The caller said she was really upset because her doctor told her that she cannot take the second vaccine due to her reaction. She wanted to know if she has any protection from just one dose. The outcome of the events was recovering.

She has a history of several allergies and she felt like she was going to have an allergic reaction. She became anxious and had slight shaking in her hands and legs.  She removed her mask and jacket and sat calmly. We took her BP and Pulse Ox and she was normal. She sat for 1 hour and then felt better to leave.  I followed-up with her 4 hrs later and she was okay but just didn&#39;t feel right. I advised her to come to the ER if her symptoms worsened.

                                                3 hours after second COVUD Pfizer injection, the tinnitus in my right ear was amplified. it was very loud and made hearing on that side almost impossible. At 6 hours I called the Advice Nurse who asked me questions and decided to send an urgent message to my Primary Care Physician. I did not get a call back from that office until end of business the next day offering an appointment 5 days in the future. By then the sound level had returned to normal so I did not make an appointment.

Later during the day when she went to check a  note without her glasses was not able to see, which she was able to do before she got the vaccine.  She cannot read anything close up right now without looking through her bifocals, which she did not have any blurry vision before the vaccine.  She now cannot read anything far away without blurry vision, mainly distance reading, but again was able to do that before.  Before her vaccine she used glasses for close up reading only.  Her arm was sore for a day and a night and has no problems with the injection site itself.  She does have an appointment with an Ophthalmologist is tomorrow.

I had right groin &#34;ache&#34;. Checked for enlarged Lymph nodes. Couldn&#39;t find.  Rt hip has been replaced. I did have crown prepped on the 17th March 23h post covid Pfizer. I took Azathioprine 500mg prior to dental appt. The groin discomfort lasted until 3/22/21 night/none arising 3/23/21. Also had left groin and lower back and rt butt cheek discomfort 3/22/21. Of course with the replacement hip (2010) and dental, I am concerned the discomfort on the RHS is hip replacement related nit Covid but Pharmacist suggested I write it up.

The next morning I had lymphedema on the rt side of my jaw and down my anterior neck. The next day I developed a large ulcerated area at the back of my throat on the right with intense ear pain. I went to the clinic and a covid test was done (I don&#39;t have the results yet). Today (7days after the injection) I returned to the clinic because  my throat ulcer had gotten larger and spots were appearing on the roof of my mouth. I again ran a low grade fever. I was again diagnosed with either a viral infection or an unusual immune response to the vaccine.

The outcome of the events was not recovered.

For two days, unable to eat anything but broth and oatmeal.  After the second dose on 3/9/21, similarly, after 6-7 days same symptoms, however, to date, they have not subsided.  Food and liquids (even water and fizzy water) tastes funny, flat.  The smell of most food is nauseating, and in the last few days I have had some explosive diarrhea, now just loose stools.  For the last 3 days have felt dizzy; not constantly, but if I move my head quickly or bend over.  I did not have covid at the time of vaccination; I have had 8 covid tests in 2021 due to medical procedures and flying.

In the days following, in addition to those symptoms, she began to cough and had a sore throat.  By March 8th, she had lost her sense of taste and sense of smell. We realized we needed to have her tested for COVID-19. We went to a testing area. She was seen and tested. She tested positive for COVID-19 (as did I).  The belief was that our illness was uncomplicated and we were sent home with instructions to monitor our symptoms.  On 03/14/2021, I took her to the hospital because her condition was worsening.

                                                her MS symptoms exploded; head became foggy; blurred eyes; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report by contactable consumer(patient) from Pfizer Sponsored program.  A 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 17Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for 20 years and autoimmune disease. Concomitant medications included interferon beta-1a (AVONEX) for MS. The patient previously took Avelox for MS. Caller also states she would like to report that she has a history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and she goes to the clinic. Caller states since no studies were done on people with MS, she would like to report her experience. Caller states she received her first dose of the vaccine on 17Mar2021 and hours afterwards her MS symptoms exploded. Caller states she has had MS for 20 years and she doesn&#39;t even realize she has it because she is able to walk the dogs at the pound and she does 3600 steps a day and it doesn&#39;t keep her from doing anything. Caller states after the shot she has torn meniscus in her knees and her knees were so tight and she has heel spurs, and they were burning and hurt. Caller states she hurt her hand previously and her hand was tight, and it felt like it was going to explode. Caller states every injury she has ever had it felt like it was exacerbated and got worse. Caller states she was instructed by the Clinic to take Tylenol every 6 hours and these symptoms lasted for 12 days. Caller states she takes a medication called Avelox for MS once a week and she didn&#39;t take it after the shot because it is known to cause flu like symptoms, but she is back taking it now. Caller states she was working on the computer and her head became foggy and this lasted for six or seven days. The caller has MS and is on Avonex, it&#39;s a beta 1 interferon injectable that she has been taking for over 20 years. The caller&#39;s doctors told her it was okay to get the shot. Because of the caller&#39;s autoimmune disease, the caller&#39;s doctors don&#39;t know how effective the shot will be with an autoimmune disease. The caller has done well with Multiple Sclerosis; her Multiple Sclerosis was really good she was walking 3600 steps a day. The vaccine seems to have flared up everywhere the caller has been hurt. It made those spots worse. The caller had a torn meniscus and it felt like her knee was stiff like a board. The caller had a bone spur in her foot that it began to hurt where that was removed. The caller broke her left hand and then it felt like it was going to explode. The caller also had head fog and blurred eyes. It took 6-7 days for head fog to get better. The other symptoms it was 12-13 days to get better. The caller also had a slight headache. The clinic said there were no studies in someone with MS who took the covid vaccine, they only reported to them about the autoimmune disease. Someone on the thing said the second dose was 10 times worse than the first one. Then the caller was told if she gets those symptoms with the first shot then the second one will be better because your body is used to it and knows what to do. It is kind of like a trial by fire and no one knows what to expect. The caller wants to know if Pfizer had any information on Avonex interfering with MS. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                A few days after my shot I started feeling very tired and groggy.  My head was dizzy most of the day.  Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.  I also have head aches but they seem to have improved as the weeks have gone by, especially since I have been taking Aleve every day.  I am unable to exercise and have very little energy still.  The dizzy head continues to persist even  6 weeks out.  I had this same kind of dizzy head in August when I had Covid but it went away in a week or two.  I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.  Will it ever get better?  I can&#39;t stand to go on like this!

                                                Bitter, metal, tinny taste in mouth within one hour or less of vaccination. I am not sure of exact time because we ate directly after the fifteen minute waiting period. I didn&#39;t notice the sensation until right after we ate. It lasted about three days and then was gone. It was strong enough for me to notice immediately and think how weird, and it was strong enough for me to notice it off and on the next three days-gradually lessening. I have also had a sore throat the whole week since the vaccination-it started the day after. It hasn&#39;t turned into a cold-maybe a little drippy nose occasionally so not sure if sinuses etc, but the sore throat is persistent. Occasionally I feel it up higher in the nasal-pharynx also.  I didn&#39;t report to my doctor or treat in any way. And for statistics, my arm was sore for about two days. The worst was that evening and pretty mild after that.

A 68-year-old female patient (consumer&#39;s mother) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number unknown as complainant does not have the product with them at the time of call) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Reporter was calling about her mother. The patient was fine before she got this shot and no one can seem to help her. They had the vaccine on 08Apr2021 and her mom (patient) started having severe reactions to it on 10Apr2021. Patient had the chills, muscle aches, muscle pain, headache, dizziness, her arm, and joint pain. She did not have fever, but had chills. She had double vision now. The symptoms are not going away. They are getting worse. They took her mom to the ER. The patient was confused. When talking to her she was talking out of her head. The severity of confusion is she thought her condo was turned completely around. Patient was not getting better. Went to the doctor and the doctor was at a lost. Patient was extremely exhausted. Caller stated they all took the same shot on the same day and her mom was the only one to have a reaction. Patient was literally out of her mind. Caller&#39;s dad had to take patient to the store with him because he didn&#39;t want to leave her by herself. They live in a condo on the second floor. Her mom thought the condo was reversed. Her dad was worried to leave her mom by herself because he didn&#39;t want her to go out the wrong door and go over the balcony. Her mom was not like that prior to receiving COVID19 Vaccine. Reporter was asked if there was an antidote. They were told patient should see her doctor and that she need treatment but no one could give they something to antidote the vaccine. The outcome of events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 14:40 (lot number: EW0150) at age of 68 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low vitamin D, lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and asthma attacks.

Patient got a flu shot every year and got it in Jan2021 and nothing. Patient stated that her symptoms were mild. Patient stated on day 1 after she got the shot she had nothing, that was 07Apr2021. Stated the next day (08Apr2021) she did not have injection site soreness but 2 inches below the injection site the muscle was hard and swollen and sore and remained that way for days 2, 3 and about day 4 it started to recede and day 7 it was tender. Stated it was one muscle and it was below the injection site, not at the injection site. Stated it was a lifting muscle, if she lifted her arm up it could only go so far and she would feel it and drop her arm down. Stated she got the injection in her left arm as she used it the least. Stated on days 2 (09Apr2021), 3 and 4 she had weakness with climbing stairs and with exertion, she could do it but she would notice it was more of a struggle. Stated that today she was off kilter again. Patient relayed that she looked all over online to see if she was sick with something. Stated she was tired on days 3 (10Apr2021) and 4 and that on days 5 (12Apr2021) and 6 she had tons of energy and she worked from dawn to dusk waxing floors and never has that much energy when she was normal. Stated that all of a sudden on day 5 and 6 she was perfect and then toward the evening of day 6 she thought it was her as she had to go to the Secretary of States and stand in line to renew her license and she did well and got home and started feeling tired. States she woke up last night of day 6 (13Apr2021) with a burning in her stomach and a stomach ache and it woke her and made her feel like she had food poisoning or something like that and nothing happened and she took 2 Tums and it kind of settled that down. Stated on day 7 (14Apr2021) she woke up and the stomach part was gone and all of a sudden she got really really hot, she runs about 97-97.4 and she got so hot and her face got really red like she had a high fever and she was 99.2, which is not much for most people but she feels and she took Motrin and after that she still feels a heaviness in her eyes and her temperature is 98.6 and she is normally in the 97&#39;s and was running a 2 degree fever and now maybe a 1 degree fever and she felt it in her eyes and didn&#39;t feel sick. Stated she felt fatigued like she want to take a nap but didn&#39;t feel ill. Stated whatever was going on was zapping her energy. Stated she woke up on day 4 (11Apr2021) in the middle of the night and her lungs were pinching, pinching, pinching, like an asthma attack and she couldn&#39;t stop it and she had to get her old fashioned inhaler to stop it. Stated this hadn&#39;t happened and she had been taking the special medication for 3 weeks now and it was very rare for her to get those attacks and this was worse than any. Patient relayed that today all day even with the special medication to open her lungs she can feel in her lungs that they were, she can&#39;t explain it, like they are gripping and releasing and gripping and releasing a little but. Stated she knew she was having some kind of asthma thing going on, it was not making her cough it was making her lungs hypersensitive. Stated she was expecting everything and she did read and nobody had symptoms that last more than 7 days and she was expecting them to be gone tomorrow, or she hopeed anyways. Stated the last 10 days had been easy-peasy and all of a sudden she was waking with all that coughing like something was irritating her lungs and she can&#39;t stop. Patient provided that it woke her husband up with her coughing for half an hour. States this lasted half an hour and was more than normal and something really irritated her lungs, shouldn&#39;t have happened as she is on the other thing every day and has not had an attack with that. Patient stated her provider didn&#39;t know as it was so relatively minor and was unusual but minor and she did not feel like it was life threatening. Stated her brother had Covid and she did not feel like she was trying to breathe and couldn&#39;t, or suffocating and dying. She did not feel that. The air irritated to even breathe and made her cough and couldn&#39;t stop and that was the first time she had to use an inhaler on top of on inhaler and something made her lungs respond to nothing there. Stated it may be her immune system thinking something was there, the headless thing in her lungs. Patient stated she thought she was over it and then got the fever not understanding if the fever was Covid related and she stayed at home and didn&#39;t go out until yesterday it was the 1st day out since Thursday and how could she have caught anything if she wasn&#39;t near anybody. Stated these were just thoughts in her head.

                                                anterior cervical fusion; Headache; tested positive for COVID-19; tested positive for COVID-19; muscle aches; Loss of taste; Loss of smell; Nausea; sore arm; Tiredness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 14Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included left hip replaced on 16Nov2020 and had her right hip replaced on 29Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported that she got the shot at 1:30 pm and on the way home she started getting tired and exhausted on 14Jan2021. She got home and went right to bed. She felt like she couldn&#39;t stay awake, fell asleep and woke up about 6 pm then with a temperature of 105.5 and stated it would fluctuate between 104-105. She was just feeling horrible. At 7:30 pm, patient had a temperature of 103.5 and at 7:45 pm, her temperature was 104. On 14Jan2021, patient stated that she couldn&#39;t see straight, had blurred vision, having trouble walking, her balance was off and falling into walls. Her body was jerking and the arm that she got the injection in was dropping. Patient called her cardiology office, and was advised to take Tylenol 3-4 times per day and alternate it with Motrin. She was also taking coated 325 mg aspirin. She can hold her head up and was not jerking as much as she was. She was doing noticeably better. Patient had put ice bags on her groin, stomach and throat to try to cool down through the night. This brought temperature down to 103. She woke up at 12 am she was 102. Her temperature at the time of report was around 101-102. She took her blood pressure it was going crazy, first it was up around 163/71 and then over time it was really low 118/58 and heart rate was 130 for a while and went to 103. The back of her neck still felt so weak and she still feels extremely weak and exhausted. She went on to report that her HR was high and B/P was up but since then it has come down. The night of 14Jan2021, her b/p was low.On 14Jan2021, patient was also real thirsty and her urine was darker and was probably dehydrated and thought that she was real jerky muscle-wise, like she is not in control of anything last night. That she has not taken BP or heart rate on 15Jan2021, but it was not pounding today though. She was doing better today at the time of report. Patient was recovering from the events of fever, blurred vision, and balance was off; not recovered from tired, jerking, and dehydration. Outcome of remaining events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899 and expiration date Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 12Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included Asthma, Allergy, and Penicillin allergy. Concomitant medication included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) for allergy at 180 mg, daily, budesonide (PULMICORT) for Asthma at Pulmicort is a inhaler 180, 2 puffs a day, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) for Asthma at 10 mg.  Historical vaccine includes Tetanus and experienced allergic reaction. Past drug includes Sulphur and experienced allergy. It was reported that the patient had the vaccine on 12Jan2021 and patient was working in long term care &#34;administrator&#34;. The patient did get a reaction and the patient hands swelled up about 20 minutes after the vaccine and her tongue swelled up. The patient did take Benadryl. The patient called her primary care doctor and was told to stay on the Benadryl and the patient was okay. The patient stated that the pharmacist that gave her the vaccine gave the Benadryl right away when the patient started swelling up.  The patient spoke to her allergist and stated that she cannot take the second dose vaccine. So, the patient was concerned about her coverage because she work in a long term case. The doctor would not give me the shingle vaccine (unspecified vaccine) because they were afraid the patient would have a reaction to that.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                The patient was referred by her primary care provider&#39;s office to receive COVID-19 vaccination. She received her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 15:07 hrs. Due to her history of allergic reactions to multiple medications (including sulfa antibiotics and ceftriaxone), she was advised to extend her monitoring period to at least 30 minutes post-injection. At around 15:50 hrs I was notified that the patient was feeling a tingling sensation in her throat, itching, and a change in her voice. She was transferred to a stretcher for acute management of suspected anaphylaxis. Airway, breathing, circulation, and mentation were assessed immediately. EMS was called immediately via 911. Her vital signs were obtained, with a BP 168/90 mm/Hg, HR 105/min, RR 24/min. She reported shortness of breath at the time. There was no stridor or wheezing on exam. She appeared in mild respiratory distress. At 15:54 hrs she was given an intramuscular EpiPen injection (0.3 mg autoinjector) in her left thigh. At 15:58 she was given an intramuscular methylprednisolone injection (125 mg) in her right thigh. Immediately after that EMS team arrived and took over her care with plans to administer diphenhydramine intramuscularly, and will transfer to ED for further management. Throughout the event the patient remained awake, alert, and fully oriented.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 20Jan2021 08:15 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing known allergies: Sulfa  and allergy to animal (cats) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 20Jan2021 08:45 AM, the patient stated, &#34;I had no symptoms during the 15 minute observation after the vaccine. After leaving the site, about 30 minutes after the shot I had the sensations of facial tingling, eye swelling and lip swelling (nothing visible on a photograph). My pulse remained stable and I had no throat symptoms or trouble breathing. This all resolved spontaneously within an hour after the shot. I am allergic to cats and sulfa but have never had anaphylaxis. I plan to stay in observation for a little longer after the 2nd shot. Any other recommendations?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered on 20Jan2021.

By the time I got home, at around 5:25 p.m., I was feeling woozy, my neck was red (flushed), I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth, I was very thirsty, and I felt that my throat was somewhat constricted.  I immediately took a Benadryl.  (I knew to do this because I had done this when I had an allergic reaction to penicillin years ago.   By about an hour later I felt alright and the redness on my neck had almost faded away.

It finally went away in January only to return when the vaccine was administered.     It has now dissipated.

She had a headache and decided to go home and forgo grocery shopping.  The next day she came in person to report experiencing tinnitus and mild headache still.  I sat with patient until she felt good enough to walk and then walked with her per her request to help her find her friend.  After about an hour of slowly getting better, but not good enough to follow through with her grocery shopping plans.  She decided to go home with her friend and rest and come back tomorrow to grocery shop and report back with any further symptoms.  She was feeling better enough to grocery shop and she was reminded to please fill out form for reporting purposes.

The tingling continued to spread over the next 10 minutes to both sides of tongue, towards the back. After about 15 minutes, I started to feel some stiffness of my jaw and teeth.  About 45 minutes later, I took 25mg benadryl at home.  The tingling and stiffness lasted a total of about 2 hours.

                                                Within 10 seconds I began to feel that something was wrong.   A full body response of a swirling congestion, extreme weakness. very blurry vision and couldn&#39;t think straight.  I had trouble walking to recovery room, felt nauseous and weak and had a very fast heartrate.  I had to stay in private recovery room for 45 min.  I was still very ill and nervous at this point.   I left with a family member and asked to be driven to the nearby hospital emergency room.  For a precaution .  We parked across from ER entrance for another 1 hour till I slowly regained strength to 50% normalcy.  I went home afterwards and had to go to bed. I was unable to drive my own vehicle home.  Day 2, still feel weak, shaky and not normal.  I consider this a serious adverse reaction that did not receive medical intervention but will prevent me from getting the second Pfizer shot.  After 5 hours post injection I felt 60% normal .  Day 2, 70 per cent normal.   The vaccination facility was not able to do blood pressure monitoring ( which is a problem for anyone experiencing reactions.)  They said their protocol was to call 911/ambulance.   My blood pressure was checked by a certified PA with professional equipment at the 3 hour post injection time and the diastolic pressure was still below 50.  And heart rate above normal.  Still weak and nauseous.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiration date: Unknown, NDC number: Unknown), intramuscularly in left arm on 26Jan2021 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included thyroid issues, back issues, she had done some reading and she has allergies to some antibiotics, one of them being sulfa, allergic to bicillins, she has a whole host of antibiotic allergies which she investigated prior to receiving the vaccine and she was told it wasn&#39;t an issue. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously took azithromycin (ZITHROMAX), levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN), omeprazole (PRILOSEC), levothyroxine and experienced allergy to all drugs. The patient did not receive prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient did not administer additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. It was reported that the caller received her COVID-19 vaccine yesterday at 14:00. She had no problems at all. She was feeling some itching on her face, arms, head on 28Jan2021. She was wanting to know was there any kind of sulfa product in the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller confirms she had no problems at all with the administration of the vaccine. She didn&#39;t feel a thing. It was very organized. The caller states the itching began about an hour ago on 28Jan2021. Caller clarifies she actually received her first vaccine on 26Jan2021 14:00. On her vaccine record card, she sees EL and the third digit was either a 9 or 4. She was able to look at her husband&#39;s vaccine card and it looks like a different person wrote on his and she sees &#34;EL9262&#34; on his card so she assumes that was what was written on hers. Caller explains she has thyroid issues and back issues, but she considers herself to be in pretty decent health. Caller states she received her first Pfizer vaccine dose 2 days ago and today around 5 pm started itching in her scalp, ears, head, face, neck and a little bit in my arms and legs. No rash. Allergic to sulfa, also allergic to &#34;the cillins&#34;, caller states she did her research before she got the vaccine. &#34;Enquired was there any sulfa in the vaccine or not.&#34; No investigation assessment. The patient did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No relevant tests. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Dr. and others are UNDERREPORTING the anaphylactic reactions cases.  Just because I didn&#39;t die or an Eppie  Pen was not given to me. doesn&#39;t mean I should not be included in the statistics.

DOSE #2: AT ABOUT 9:30 AM ON MONDAY, MARCH 22.  THE INJECTION (LEFT ARM, AGAIN) WAS, IN COMPARISON TO THE FIRST &#39;JAB&#39;, CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THIS DID NOT CONCERN ME.  HOWEVER, ON MY DRIVE HOME (ABOUT 20 MINUTES) MY ARM GRADUALLY BECAME VERY SORE, AND CONTINUED TO BE PAINFUL AND GET WORSE OVER THE FOLLOWING HOURS.  I COULD NOT USE OR LIFT MY LEFT ARM WITH SIGNIFICANT PAIN NOT ALEVIATED BY IBUPROFEN (3 TO  4 AT A TIME).  THIS CONTINUED THROUGH WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24 AT WHICH TIME I TOOK ONE (1) TYLENOL AND ONE (1) IBUPROFEN, AND THAT HELPED WITH THE ACHE.  AS OF THURSDAY, MARCH 25 (WHEN I AM RECORDING THIS) IT  IS LESS PAINFUL, AND I AM ABLE TO LIFT THE LEFT ARM WITH LESS DISCOMFORT.   MY SHOULDER SOCKET ALSO SEEMS TO BE LESS PAINFUL.  I AM SENDING THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE I READ THAT TINNITUS HAS BEEN EXPERIENCE BY A SMALL GROUP OF VACCINE RECIPIENTS, AND BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT PERSONS THE EXPERIENCE WAS MORE THE WAY THE VACCINE WAS INJECTED (MAYBE NOT IN THE CORRECT LOCATION).  I HAVE NOT FELT THE NEED TO SEE A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH PROVIDER.  I HAVE CHANGED MY insurance AND AM REVIEWING NEW PROVIDERS.

A 69-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL3302), intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 21Jan2021 13:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at Hospital. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 29Jan2021, The patient experienced sick, minor cold, watery eyes, headache. Patient has already got her first dose of the Covid vaccine on 21Jan2021. She took 600mg Ibuprofen two hours before getting the vaccine. She was reading that taking ibuprofen prior to getting the vaccine could have been a problem as far as the efficacy. on 29Jan2021, she started to get sick, she does not think it is related. She has a little cold. She wondered what she should do. She is scheduled for the second dose. HCP stated She will have the first consult with hcp on Monday. She does not have a hcp right now. no email When querying outcome of her cold, states it is different, on the night of the 29th she had watery eyes and a tiny headache. She sneezed twice maybe the next day. She is slightly nasally and now it has gone to her throat and down to her chest. It is like a typical cold. She does not think she had a fever, but she did not take her temperature. She did not take ibuprofen. She normally would take ibuprofen if she does not feel good. She knows she has a cold, she did not have a sore throat. Normally when she get sick she gets a sore throat and that nose like feeling, but with this cold her symptoms are super slight. Reports she has had some doozy colds in the past. She wanted to mention that Friday night she was in a car with a driver running errands, and she thinks she may have picked up a cold from the driver that was nasally and blew his nose. States when she gets a cold, she really gets a cold and this cold is minor compared to colds she has had prior. When she got the first shingrix shot, she developed a large red, swollen, elliptical circle thing that took up half of her arm from elbow to the top of the arm. She had two doses of the shingrix. When she took Benadryl and ibuprofen before getting the second dose of shingrix, she did not have a reaction. Patient took 1st dose of Covid vaccine and developed a cold about 8 days later. Patient also took 600mg of pain reliever and is now hearing that it can decrease the efficacy of the Covid vaccine. The action taken in response to the event for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was unknown.

When patient arrived ( approximately 835pm), patient sat down on the chair. The redness started to extend to her neck and it was then decided to place the patient to the stretcher. Vitals signs were done in which the BP was 183/104 and 174/101 (845pm). The redness spreaded to her forehead and neck. Benadryl 50mg PO was then given (847pm). Patient BP was taken again which was 182/122 , pulse 80, RR 24 (855pm). Patient then complained about pressure in her throat, eyes (right eyes slightly swollen ) and face. It was then decided that epinephrine (859PM) be used but unfortunately the trainer box was removed so the epinephrine was not actually given. The BP documented was then 193/112 (0859PM). EMS  was then called as the epinephrine was administered per protocol. EMS arrived (0910 PM) and BP at that time was 230/112, pulse 70. Patient was started with heart monitor and IV. EMS then took her to the Emergency across the street with husband.

                                                About two minutes after we left the park (which was 15 min. after the vaccination) I felt needles poking the tip of my tongue.  My daughter turned around and tried to get back to the park but there was a very long line, so I decided to wait and see what happened.  The pain subsided after a few minutes, and then the tip of my tongue just felt numb.  I do not know exactly for how long it was numb because I fell asleep when I got home after an hour drive from the site.  When I woke up it felt better, but the next day and up to today it feels as if the tip of my tongue was burnt with a hot liquid.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

                                                On days 4-7 post injection, I experienced facial nerve pain that felt like herpes or shingles including ear pain, cheek hypersensitivity, swollen gland in neck, and sores along the bottom left gum line in my mouth.  This all occurred on the right side of my face.  I did not treat the pain or eruptions in any way except for regular dental care.  The symptoms healed/subsided after 5 days .  I have a small amount of residual sensation in my jaw near my ear but it is much better.

I left and about 10 minutes after I left, all of sudden I started feeling, I started feeling hives on the roof of my mouth. I could feel with my tongue blister things on the roof in my mouth. Within in a few minutes they began to burst and liquid came out. I did call my doctor and they had someone call me and to make an appointment with an allergist. I do not remember the Allergist&#39;s name but I am scheduled to see her tomorrow 2/11/2021 at 8:30 AM.  I spoke with my doctor and 2 people.  As of today my mouth is still a little sore, my tongue feels funny and swollen.

Trunk itches and belly fat feels like someone is squeezing it, swollen hands and feet.  This time had puffy eyes and lips,with neck and genitals itching.  Over my body an erythema that turns white when stroked.  On my right arm, where I received the shot, very large splotch approximately 3 inches by two inches (red and swollen.) Feeling of malaise and dizzy.  Stiff neck and swollen joints in fingers.  Visited outpatient clinic for check up.  Given Hydroxysine HCL 25mg x 3 per day. When I was  in my early 30s had an anaphylactic reaction to something I ate???  Went to ER for shot of epinephrine.  We never discovered what it was I was allergic to.

                                                Two hours after injection, I began wheezing. Four hours after injection, the wheezing worsened, the inside of my mouth started itching, and I had abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. These symptoms lessened the next day but continued for one week.   I did not report these reactions immediately, as I did not want them to prevent my receiving the second covid vaccine dose. Also, if the second covid vaccine dose started to cause the same type of reaction, I was prepared to use two Epi Pens and call 9-1-1. Fortunately, the second dose caused only a sore arm.

Left ear is fine.  I have been experiencing loud tinnitus in the right ear, also. The Dr is treating me with a large dose of prednisone for 2&#43; weeks.  He has ordered an MRI. The hearing after 2 weeks is starting to come back-now I am at 50% hearing.

I called an ambulance at about 2:00 am on February 18, 2021, with severe pain on the left side of my face and left neck. The pain in my teeth felt like it was being drilled. I was nauseated and the ambulance people thought I was having a heart attack. My blood pressure is normally 110/65, but it was close to 200/104, I think they said. A few days later I went to another ER because the doctor thought I was having a stroke.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 10Feb2021, 12:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s Hypothyroidism from 2000 (had it at least five years before a diagnosis), allergies year-round, depression, pneumonia, wheezing, calcium deficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) taken for Hashimoto&#39;s Hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date and ongoing; bupropion hcl (BUPROPION HCL) taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing; loratadine (LORATADINE) taken for allergies year round from an unspecified start date and ongoing; aspartate calcium, aspartate zinc, calcium ascorbate, glucosamine sulfate, magnesium aspartate, manganese aspartate (BONE STRENGTH) taken for calcium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; carbinoxamine maleate (OMEGA 100), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3), chondroitin sulfate, collagen, glucosamine (COLAGEN) taken for an unspecified indications from an unspecified start dates and ongoing. When she was older the patient was given the high dose Flu Vaccine and had this reaction where her arm was red from shoulder down to elbow. After that she told them not to give her the high dose Flu Vaccine. She gets the regular Flu Vaccine. She assumes it occurred year turned 65, but was not sure. She does not have a lot/exp/NDC to provide. The patient experienced arm started hurting and very tired (around 7:00-7:30), very thirsty (had to drink three tall glasses of water back to back, reported she was never that thirsty), one of legs got weak (for a brief moment one of her legs was very weak and noticed while walking from the living room to the bed room) and achy on 10Feb2021. It was reported that the patient took a bath with Epsom Salt and it id not help. She got in bed by 8PM. Normally she goes to bed around 9:30-10 PM, but she was very tired. She then followed up and stated she went to sleep after the news about 10:20.  Then at 4:45 AM she woke up  because her eyes were very dry. Stated she has a humidifier in the apartment and usually has no trouble with her eyes, but they were very dry. She also noticed her ribs were hurting and it was noticeable on 11Feb2021. She was also more achy, but it the ribs hurting did not last real long. Then she noticed she was wheezing (11Feb2021). She knows she was wheezing because she has had pneumonia in the past and had wheezing then. The wheezing she had after the vaccine was not real bad. It stopped after about 10-15 minutes or so. She had laid down in bed for a while then got up around 5:30 AM. She felt better around then, but it took until like around 8AM before she felt fully okay as her arm was still aching. The outcome of the event arm started hurting and achy  was recovered on 12Feb2021; eyes dry, ribs hurting and wheezing recovered on 11Feb2021; thirst and muscular weakness recovered on 10Feb2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

                                                About five hours after receiving the vaccine my ears started to ring. At the same time I felt a rush of heat through my body and I became short of breath. But I experience shortness of breath quite often with my asthma so this is not unusual. But the tinnitus has not gone away after over two weeks ofter receiving the shot. I am worried it will get worse if I have a second shot.

I felt later agitated, had dry mouth, headache- improved after drinking 8-10 cups of water.  I did not seek help. I stayed in the  shot area in a large tent.

Doctor on site saw that I was having an event  which he thought was either a TIA or Stroke because my smile was crocked, lip was drooping and BP was very high. The doctor ordered an Ambulance who transported me to hospital as the doctor said they were equipped to handle such an event as they are a Trauma 1 hospital.

A 70-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6202) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included a lot of allergies from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included losartan taken for high blood pressure, start and stop date were not reported; formoterol fumarate, mometasone furoate (DULERA) taken for bronchial hyperreactivity, start and stop date were not reported; fluticasone to help her breathe, start and stop date were not reported; fexofenadine a decongestant for allergies, start and stop date were not reported; tolnaftate antifungal solution for toenail, start and stop date were not reported; and fluorometholone taken for plugged up tear duct, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient previously had flu shot once about 15 years ago and it was terrible. With the first dose, the patient started to have loss of appetite, pretty bad headache, body aches, tightness in her chest, ringing in her ears, and stomach cramps. She slept 15 hours the first night. She got up to go the bathroom and then went right back to bed. That happened after first dose and she wasn&#39;t too anxious to get the second dose. These were pretty strong. For 24 hours after onset they were pretty severe. Then she experienced variation of these and lessening of severity over seven days. By the next Wednesday she felt her normal self. She got both shots on Wednesday. She didn&#39;t have fever or any other problems that COVID people get. The patient had an infection on the abdomen. She took Cephalexin for 10 days. The infection on the abdomen started in early Mar2021. It was like a lump in Mar2021. She went to the dermatologist because there is cancer in her family. The dermatologist told her not to worry. Then it erupted like a big pimple in Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information on lot/batch number is available.

                                                Day of shot #2 (3/31/21) I experienced nausea in the first 15 minutes and felt confused while driving.  Nausea passed in 2-3 hours and I felt fine.  The next day I felt tired, foggy brain, and dizzy.  Assumed it was from the shot.  Side effects continued/worsened.  4/6/21 I saw my Dr.  She checked me over, labs. found nothing wrong with me.  Likely side effects from Pfizer.  Unlikely that they would last two weeks.  Rx Meclizine for dizziness, which didn&#39;t really help.  Now it&#39;s Day 15.  Tired and brain fog are gone.  I don&#39;t feel as dizzy.  BUT, when I try to drive, I feel QUITE dizzy with blurred vision.  This side effect persists and clearly effects my quality of life.

This 70-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6200, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Feb2021, 12:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). The patient was not pregnant. Medical history included colon polyps and diverticulosis. Allergies to medications, food, or other products included premarin, ambien and many seasonal allergies. Co-suspect medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) for diverticulitis. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included acebutolol hydrochloride (SECTRAL), allopurinol, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) and amitriptyline. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Jan2021, 13:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18 Mar2021, 4 weeks after second vaccine, the patient took Augmentin for recurring diverticulitis. For the last few years, the patient has taken the Augmentin once or twice a year to treat the problem (alternative to the flagyl/cipro regimine) and she have never had any problems. This time, on the 3rd day of the Augmentin, the patient broke out in large hives, (palm sized) and had swollen earlobes and a swollen palm on her right hand. The next day on 19Mar2021 she had swollen upper and lower lips. The patient took lots of Benadryl and Zyrtec, and by the 5th day her hives and horrendous itching went away. The patient does not know if the vaccine played any role in this at all. She just thought she should report since prior to the vaccine she never had a problem with Augmentin. The patient had absolutely no reaction at all to the Pfizer Covid vaccine itself after either of the doses. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. The outcome of all the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

                                                After receiving the first shot on Monday,  I developed a headache and double vision on Tuesday night. I consulted an ophthalmologist and I am awaiting the scheduling of an MRI. He could find no physical problem with either eye. The double vision persists. I realize this may be purely coincidental and unrelated to the vaccine, but I felt I should report it.

Patient was given TPA in the past she was within window and she was then transferred here for further management.  Patient&#39;s symptoms continue to resolve.  She was admitted in the ICU and managed by neuro critical care and neurology.  Further imaging including CTA head and neck, MRI brain did not reveal any stroke.  An assessment of small vessel disease was made which likely resolved after TPA was given.  Patient was assessed by PMR and PT/OT and deemed safe to go home with family care and no restrictions.  Echo, telemetry and EKG showed no signs of cardiac involvement.  Patient was started Plavix x21 days and chronic baby aspirin.  She was also started on Crestor 20 mg daily.  Patient is to follow-up with neurology in 3 months as she got TPA.  She will also follow-up with her PCP on discharge.

                                                This was my second dose. After the first dose, I only had a sore arm. This time, about 12 hours after receiving the shot, I began to feel aches and pains (like a cold was coming on). During the night I had some chills and the next day I was very achy and very tired. I napped about 4 hours during the day and was asleep by 8p.m. and slept for 12 hours. The next day (second day after the shot), the aches receded but I was still very lethargic for about another 8 hours.  I began to feel &#39;normal&#39; by evening and am felling OK today (third day after the shot). I did drink a lot of water during the whole time as I felt very thirsty (and I am normally a big water drinker!) I also had no appetite until this morning.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL1284, expiration date: 30Apr2021) intramuscular on the right arm on 15Jan2021 at 30 ug, single for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer survivor and allergic to walnuts. Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, herbal nos, levoglutamide, lysine, magnesium, manganese, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, tocopherol, zinc (AIRBORNE) for supplementation therapy, HCTZ for high blood pressure, vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN [VITAMINS NOS]) for supplementation therapy, rosuvastatin for high cholesterol. The patient received 1st dose of vaccine on Friday and on 17Jan2021 evening, experienced the following: &#34;swelling of right side of face, eyes swollen/puffy.&#34; She spoke with HCP office and was told to take Benadryl and Tylenol. She took the medication and the &#34;swelling went down&#34;. She said she woke up this morning and had &#34;puffy underneath eyes&#34;, &#34;like bags&#34;, and &#34;slight facial swelling.&#34; The patient ate at an Indian restaurant on 17Jan2021 at about 6:30-7:00pm and was unsure if her reaction was to the vaccine or food, since the food she ate could have been cooked with nut oil. She said that her eyes were still puffy and her face was still a little swollen. She went to see her doctor today 19Jan2021 and he was trying to figure out what could have caused this on his end. The patient said that the right side of her face was swollen and was itching. The left side did not appear to be swollen at all. Outcome of the event pruritus facial was unknown while recovering for the other events.

If so, how do I treat it? How do I decide if my second dose will be okay to take?

                                                Pt noted after approx 15 minutes a tingling/burning sensation of tongue At 4:45 pm.   No associated SOB, facial swelling.  She does have prior anaphylaxis reaction to pineapples for which she carries and epi Pen but has never needed to use.   Cardiac exam RRR Lungs CTA bilat HEENT, no visible erythema of face or tongue and no noteable facial swelling  She was agreeable to 25 mg dose of diphenhydramine and another 15 minute observation.    During this time, she began to feel anxious and a mild headache.  Vitals at that time were notable for bp 178/81, HR 101 and o2 sat 98%.  Still no SOB, facial swelling or other new complaint.  She felt improvement in anxiety within 5 minutes, and repeat vitals in 10 min with BP 152/83, HR 89 and O2 sats 96%  She still continued with mild sensation change of tongue, but no facial swelling.   She does have benedryl at home but I also sent her home with additional 25 mg dose in case she noted recurrent symptoms on the way home .  She understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable returning home- husband picked her up.    I will call her to check in this evening and in the morning and will provide updated recommendations regarding second dose of vaccination.     I spoke with patient at 8:09 pm - she was at home- feeling much better, however, she did take the second diphenhydramine on the way home, as she began to feel she was having some swelling between her eyes.  No SOB  Or trouble swallowing.  This improved with the second benedryl and has not recurred.    She will take an additional 50 mg benedryl before bed, and then she awakes before 6 am- if she has any residual symptoms she will take another dose.  Again, she understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable with this plan.    We also reviewed current CDC guidelines and she understands at this time we would not recommend she receive the second Vaccination.  She will continue to follow CDC in the event that this recommendation changes.  I will submit a VAERS report after following up with her in the morning.     ADDENDUM 2/3/21:  I spoke with patient again on 2/3/21 at 07:45 am. She is feeling almost completely back to baseline this morning, but planning to take 25 mg diphenhydramine this morning as well. She does note mild headache, which is not abnormal for her.  No residual tongue sensitivity or facial swelling.  She noted that when she got home last night, she felt very sleepy and sedated from the diphenhydramine and went to bed, and did not take an additional dose of diphenhydramine last night.  No SOB, trouble swallowing or any new complaint.  No urticaria or itching.    We reviewed current CDC recommendations to decline second vaccination given her moderate severe allergic symptoms within first 4 hours of first vaccination.  She will follow up with PCP or kidney specialist if she has any continued concern with ongoing symptoms or new issues.  She was very appreciative of the followup and care provided.

After 30 minutes, I was released, though still had those symptoms the rest of that day. The EMT at the site thought I&#39;d had a mild allergic response. 36 hours after the shot, I woke up itching a lot on my head, trunk, and arms. I saw no obvious rash (maybe a little mottling) or hives. I used a small dab of Benadryl cream on the itchiest spot. The symptoms disappeared  pretty soon.

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A 71-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL 9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jan2021 16:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid, allergies: Sulfites in foods and drugs, allergies: Penicillin. Concomitant medications included metformin at 800 mg, twice a day and levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN) at 75mg, once a day. The patient previously took sulfur and experienced allergies: sulfur. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 22Jan2021, at 16:15, the patient reported nose felt tingly front teeth and right side of my tongue felt numb. The patient carries an epi pen for an allergic reaction as the patient have to sulfites in foods and drugs (sulfur and penicillin allergies). The patient did not have to call for help or use epi-pen but was concerned somewhat for the second dose in 19 days. The events was considered as non-serious by the consumer. When the patient went home about 15 minutes later still felt this, hence the therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events included treatment with 2tbl Benadryl and 1/2 Zertex and within 30 minutes the patient was ok. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

I had head pains, inner ear pains, naseau, sore muscles, and extreme fatigue. I slept the whole day, waking up and going back to sleep. I dranka little, but just didn&#39;t feel like it. I ate a piece of toast with butter that evening and then felt naseauated.  I slept through the night and woke up feeling a little better the next day, but still feel tired and have some pains in my head.

                                                48 hours after shot in left arm I started to have a earache on left side, traveled down the left side of face, into jaw area and down left side of my throat like tonsils and into neck area.  Into 72 hours after shot my face, neck and throat area started swelling.  At that time I went to ER for assistance due to the swelling and pain.  The ER after taking  review thought it a infected saliva gland and treated me for that.  As told by ER if no large progress contact my local Dr. and see ENT.  On Tues. (one week from Covid injection) I was in touch with my local  Dr. they had me come to their office for some care and scheduled me with a ENT.  They have been able to get the profuse swelling down out of the left side of my face, neck and throat.  I&#39;m scheduled for a CT scan on March 5, 2021 to see where the original problem started.  I&#39;m contacting  you for two reason&#39;s  1.  I have a March 10th. appointment scheduled I need to cancel and am having issues doing this.  Even in light of all this I want to reschedule for late April for my second shot and am not able to do that as well.   2.  Can you assist with any information if this has happened to other folks and if I should be clear to take my second dose.  This has been quite a nightmare and hard to bring under control.  I believe in the vaccine and this maybe just a quirk in how it happened but any information you can give me would be welcome.  I have looked on the website and it does say that there have been people who have also had symptoms like this from the shots where the side they get the shot on reacts.  Thanking you in advance for your time and assistance.

                                                Friday: Before I left facility I started tingling around my mouth but ignored. When I got home my arthritic places that always hurt started intensifying more than usual but not my injection arm.  Started itching on my head and went down in different spots on my body. Never had hives except from scratching. Took 1  otc Benadryl when continued itching then again at bedtime. They helped but not 100%. Saturday: Woke up in the morning with more itching, headache, fatigue.Eyes burning for three days, Continued Benadryl and Tylenol for headache and joint aches. No fevers. Monday: went to urgent care. They first gave me a Zyrtec, then 30 minutes later gave me a steroid IM. Did urine test. Prescribed: dexamethazone 4mg. 1 in the morn for 5 days, singular 10 mg. Daily, Zyrtec 10 mg. Daily.  Drink lots of water. Each morning after I went to urgent care I?d wake up itching until Friday morning. Itching has improved. Took my last script this morn on Saturday. First day not fatigued and very sleep was Thursday. The other days before I slept a lot.  I?m just concerned if it will be okay to take the second dose. I have it on March 19.

                                                20 minutes after injection, I began feeling progressively warmer as if I had beads of sweat on my forehead.  I began to feel light as if my body was light. The Lead Monitor came over and had my blood pressure and oxygen levels checked over the next 40 minutes before I felt actually fine and able to walk out.  At no point did I have trouble breathing although that question was repeatedly put to me.  Then at home I took it easy but noted anything out of the ordinary. 1.5 hrs after the injection and lasting only 2 minutes, I felt like a band was being tightened around my head to the point of discomfort but not pain. 24 hrs after the injection, for less than one minute, my left temple felt pressure as if I had a head cold. I haven&#39;t had a headache in a decade so this was unusual for me. 10 hrs after the injection, I was awakened to by cramping from lower Achilles to foot in my right leg only. This lasted painfully for 12 minutes.  My right foot  itself felt numb. I would stand to stretch the muscle/ tendon but then immediately felt nauseous. I hate feeling nauseous so I would lay back down only to have to stand again due to the pain of the persistent  cramping. This was 12 minutes of excruciating leg cramps. When usually I might have only one or two very brief leg cramps per year. 14.5 hours after injection, I awoke very thirsty adn my skin felt very dry. I drank water and applied hand lotion. Thereafter the vaccine site felt sore but the injection site would have been invisible but for the bandaid outline that narrowed down where the injection had to have been located. The vaccine site was never red or pink or raised at all. Just a pin prick if you really looked for it.  As a follow-up, the second Pfizer dose was Lot  EM9809 on Feb. 26, 2021, and I had no reaction at all. No visible injection site in right arm, no warmness, no light-headedness, no cramps, nothing at all happened.

                                                This patient developed a severe, multisystem inflammatory syndrome after covid vaccination that necessitated hospitalization for 6 days. It involved skin (rash), liver (elevated bilirubin and asT/alt), bone marrow (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), cns (hallucinations, visual disturbance), and musculoskeletal system (synovitis). Inflammatory markers were markedly elevated with ferritin over 1000 and CRP over 100. COVID infection was definitively excluded.

Suddenly, I also felt very tired and achy with chills but no fever.  That continued until I went to sleep that night.  The next morning my eye was partially closed but much better then the former afternoon and evening.  Also, there was no more headache, aches or chills.  My right eye seemed to close a little more as the day went on.  Better every day and completely open in about a week.

Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

The patient experienced joint pain and &#39;having difficulty walking&#39; (both serious, disabling) and dry skin (medically significant) on 19Feb2021; itching, difficulty chewing, and small bruises (all serious, medically significant) on Mar2021; eye floaters on an unspecified date; and &#39;did the CRP and it was elevated/C reactive protein- elevated&#39; (non-serious) on 08Mar2021. Patient&#39;s clinical course is as follows: a physician reporting on behalf of his wife (patient). It was reported that patient received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Reporter stated that they have side effects to report and wanted to find out how common these side effects are and how long they are going to last. Patient received first dose on 17Jan2021 and second on 05Feb2021. It was reported that the patient has been having joint pain starting from 19Feb2021 and it fluctuates from one joint to another so if the patient&#39;s shoulder is affected, the joint pain goes to the other side and then to a different joint such as her knee joint. The pain was continuous, and it doesn&#39;t disappear. Reporter mentioned that it gets better with medication but it&#39;s still not going away. Regarding patient&#39;s treatment, it was reported that in the beginning, patient was taking ibuprofen but now the doctor switched it to naproxen (ALEVE) and also added hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (NORCO). Reporter mentioned that sometimes not only the patient&#39;s joints gets affected, patient also experienced difficulty chewing, but it goes away and then comes back.

Initially, reporter mentioned that patient doesn&#39;t have eye floaters before but now she does, then clarified she has seen it before the vaccine, but now she sees it more and it is pretty much every day.

Seriousness criteria for joint was reported that this is disabling as the patient was having difficulty walking, getting up from the bed from the chair, patient has to use a walker to walk and needs help going to bathroom and taking a shower. It was reported that joint pain has definitely affected patient&#39;s normal walking. Reporter also mentioned that he was not exactly sure when the dry skin started but it was around the time the joint pain started. Seriousness criteria for dry skin and itching was reported as medically significant because it does bother the patient. Patient was scratching even in her sleep, even though they use the moisturizer and cream. Reporter clarified it was not debilitating but it does bother the patient. Reporter mentioned that difficulty chewing started over the last few days, on Friday or Saturday. It comes and goes, one day patient might have it in the afternoon, but it goes away in the evening. Reporter added that the eye floaters started more in the last one week. They do not know why this is happening, if it was vaccine related or not. The medicines the patient takes shouldn&#39;t be causing these, but they don&#39;t know if it was the medicine causing it or if it&#39;s the vaccine. Causality for was reported as &#39;didn&#39;t have these issues before, thinks it&#39;s related, this is for all the events&#39;. It was further reported that the doctor did the CRP and it was elevated also reported as C reactive protein- elevated on Monday 08Mar2021.

When I was drinking the water I was having problems swallowing. Then I started having problems breathing. I then broke down on a rash my skin was so red it looked like I was sun burned. My skin also peeled. Then I was taken into the emergency room by ambulance. They put an IV on me when I got to the hospital. They put a steroid &amp; pepcid famotidine. They told me if I was not better by the next day to go back. My voice also goes occasionally &amp; I still don&#39;t have energy.

                                                allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction; heart started pounding and racing; high blood pressure 220/118; throat felt funny; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable Nurse (Patient).  A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 23Mar2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: Jul2021) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included low magnesium, low vitamin D, allergy to Band-Aids, skin adhesives, and allergy to polyurethane spray tan (She&#39;s had a reaction to polyurethane on wood floors at her dad&#39;s house. Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

                                                diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL); tinnitus; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration, in right arm, on 02Mar2021 (at the age of 71 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia, blood pressure (abnormal), blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medications included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) for fibromyalgia, metoprolol for blood pressure; atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) for cholesterol; vitamin d3 for vitamin; ubidecarenone (COQ10) for vitamin; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]; and calcium carbonate (CALTRATE). The patient had no history of previous immunizations and no additional vaccines administered on the same date. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient developed an adverse event from the vaccine, in which her doctor prescribed her to receive steroid injections in her ear drum to help with tinnitus and hearing loss experienced from the vaccine on 22Mar2021. The patient is two weeks post second vaccine administration and asked if she can take a steroid orally rather than having to get it injected into her ear drum. The patient stated that she can&#39;t be absolutely sure that this adverse event was from the vaccine. She further reported that she had the first dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021. On 22Mar2021, she woke up completely deaf in one ear and it was diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL). Stated that along with that, she had had severe ringing in the ear, like tinnitus type of condition. Stated that she went to the doctor on 22Mar2021 to the ear, nose, throat (ENT) doctor and stated that he was not absolutely sure. Stated that in the ENT industry is looking at the fact that they are having many patients coming in with this condition. They don&#39;t know if this is because of the vaccine or the fact that so many people are getting the vaccine. They are seeing an up rise in this condition and are dealing with it.  Stated that the doctor didn&#39;t want to give oral steroids, which is the recommendation because, she was having the second dose of vaccine on 23Mar2021. Decided to inject steroid into ear drum instead of doing it orally because he didn&#39;t want to kind of cancel out the vaccine. States that she still does not know if the ringing, tinnitus is from the vaccine or not. Stated that she has now had 3 injections of this steroid directly into her ear. Further, ringing in ear started as mild ringing and she woke up completely deaf in that ear. The patient got the third injection on 02Apr2021. After the first injection, started getting some hearing back, not much, but is a little improved. Stated that it is slightly improved. She does not know the name of the injected steroid. States that currently, as recommended by her doctor, is undergoing HBOT therapy, which is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Stated that it is known to be helpful in this SSHL condition. Stated that she has had 5 treatments and is going to continue until 20 treatments. The event required a visit at physician office. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on unspecified date to make sure, there are two things in the brain that could cause loss of hearing; 1 is a tumor and one is something else and the patient don&#39;t have either. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event. Outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching/itching a little again in the palm of her hands; some face soreness; her BP was 152/85 that was high; she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching; having an allergic reaction; a little puffiness on her lip; the cellulitis part of her skin; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL3249), intramuscular on the right arm, at the age of 72 years, on 13Jan2021 09:45 at a SINGLE  DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason&#39;s she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn&#39;t feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria). The outcome of the event onset of burning and itching and skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over was recovered on an unspecified date while other events were unknown.

                                                Four hours post injection I became flushed and broke out in hives and a red itchy rash on my body and legs.  My heart rate jumped at the same time.  I took Benadryl immediately, and for the next 24 hours.  The itchy rash has persisted on and off ever since ( 6.5 weeks).  In addition I have had many other symptoms.  Excessive hair loss, a severe metallic taste in my mouth that is getting worse over time.  At the suggestion I was scratch tested for PEG (negative), but I have since learned that test is not reliable.  I tried to go on a sustained course of antihistamines but got allergic reactions to both 24 hour Allegra and 24 hour Claritin.  My primary care doc has me on a course f very high dose vitamin C and I am getting some relief, but if i don&#39;t take the vitamin the itching returns.

                                                Immediately upon leaving the COVID shot parking lot at Hospital, I began to feel pain shooting down my arm all the way to my fingertips. Then I started to feel disoriented. Then, as I was driving myself home, I felt constriction in my chest, like I was barely holding onto consciousness, then pain shooting up my shoulder into the left side of my neck, the left side of my face, my left eye and into the left side of my head. My heart was pounding, my head was hurting intensely and I wondered whether I was having a stroke while trapped in stop and go traffic. The intense pain continued while I drove, for about 30 minutes. Then it subsided somewhat -- but continued through the evening. I could not get to The pain continued in my arm, up the left side of my body and into my head all night. I could not sleep. My heart was pounding. Somehow I dozed off around 2 or 3am. The next day I felt groggy and tired, with the more moderate pain continuing in my arm and all the way to my hand. Finally, on Monday morning, I was able to reach my doctor&#39;s office. I was told to go the ER, which I did. They could find nothing &#34;emergent.&#34; The pain, tiredness and headaches continued through Thursday. Friday I started to feel better -- a week after the shot on Saturday, 2/27.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine shot in my arm, I felt a feeling of a nerve sensation shooting across my lower face. My lower face, both sides, turned numb. I also instantly got a headache, not severe, the pain was about a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst. After waiting 15 minutes, I asked to talk to a medical person and was directed to an EMT. I explained my facial numbness and he knew nothing about it and just said to see a doctor if it moved to any other part of my body.  Over the following days, my jaw, lips and gums have been feeling a numb tingling feeling, exactly as if I have had Novocain at the dentist and it is wearing off. After one week, the symptoms  were continuing and I was worried, so I called the advice nurse. After explaining my symptoms to her she advised me to immediately have someone drive me to the nearest emergency room. I went to the ER where I was seen by the dr. He did some research and said there have been a couple of other reports of people having these symptoms. He thought they would go away and wasn?t  concerned. It has been 11 days now and my jaw, gums and lips still feel numb and tingly. The feeling comes and goes.

Hydrocortisone Ointment (2.5%) was applied, but afforded little relief. The rash and itching continued for about three weeks, only lessening the last  several days.  Also on day 12 after the first dose, my lower lip began to feel as if it were sunburned (which it was not) and swelled slightly. Lip balm was applied. The strong burning feeling lasted burning lasted for about three weeks, only lessening the last  several days.  On the day following the second dose, a smaller red circle appeared around the injection site which itched moderately. It did not continue to itch or appear red after 3 days post injection.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

Over the next 2 days the rash spread up my back, and to the top of my thighs.  The second day it spread down my legs to my feet (but not as severe) and on my arms down to my hands.  My head also began itching. This lasted for about 10 days and has now cleared up. I experienced extreme exhaustion and dry mouth. I still feel tired and have a dry mouth when arising.

Called doctor on day 4 but was not treated.  On day 7 was started on an antibiotic which did help the pressure but did not help the ear pain and noise in ear.  Better now but still has &#34;noise in head&#34;  but states it is improving.

Then driving home she started feeling itchy, and could feel little hives in each ear.  She was then very lethargic that night and all the next day Sunday, and then first thing Monday morning was covered with a large hives and a rash.  She was covered from one end of her body to the other and into her joints where she was not able to bend her joints.  She tried to use cortisone, but that made it worse.  Also tried Benadryl lotion and Calamine lotion, which also did not help.  She then went to the doctor and he prescribed steroids.  She has had pain as if somebody was sticking needles in her.  In the past 2 days her lips are numb and swelled, and on the right cheek plus her two eyes there is a big swollen area and her eyes are burning.  Now her entire body is peeling as if she had a bad sunburn.   Now her blood sugar due to the steroids is from 250-475.  The site of the vaccine itself was ok.

I was fine so I walked out to my truck.  I became flushed in the face and my mouth had a metallic taste so I walked back into the clinic to tell them.  They took my Blood pressure which was 200/125.  I felt very off so they wheeled me into Urgent Care where they gave me one benadryl and monitored my blood pressure.  They then called for ambulance for ER . I was released when my blood pressure was lower.  I will not get the second injection of Pfizer!

                                                About five days after vaccination ,I felt like I was having anxiety and apprehension. I don&#39;t normally have anxiety. I was hearing weird sounds like crackling in my head. My concentration was not normal.  Those symptoms lasted for several weeks. I went to see my doctor and he advised as long as it seemed to be improving, he would wait to consider treatment.  It slowly got better, I had some good parts of some days. I finally felt normal six weeks out from the second dose of the vaccine.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN5318, Expiration Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm at the dose of 30mcg/0.3mL on 29Jan2021 (at the age of 72-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient did not receive concomitant medications. The patient previously took second shingles shot (two weeks and 7 hours prior to COVID-19 vaccine). The patient did not underwent lab investigations. Caller said she had gotten the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine on 29Jan2021, which was on a Friday. She had no symptoms at all from it. The following Thursday on 04Feb2021 she was in her kitchen and went to get something on the fridge, and she felt the sensation as if someone sprayed something up her nose, like a foul smell up her nose/ an odd smell to it. It lasted 30 seconds or something. It was quick and not debilitating. It was a very unusual sensation. She wanted to see if anything like this has been reported? Some people are sensitive to smells, but she was not sensitive to smells. She does not tend to notice odor or smells. She was not sure if it was connected to the vaccine, but if it was not she does not know what it would be connected to. Her cousin was a nurse and she told her to search it. She did find it in the internet it was not connected with the vaccine, but connected with people who have had COVID. She had never done research on this before. Caller clarifies that she has not had COVID before. She was tested and did it that way. She has been tested for COVID and antibodies. She has not tested positive for either. She also has no symptoms or anything of COVID. She has never tested positive. The day she got the shot on 29Jan2021, two weeks and 7 hours prior to that, she had gotten her second shingles shot. She had asked 3 different pharmacists about this, and they had all said to wait 2 weeks to get the COVID vaccine after any other vaccinations. The event was assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Outcome of the event was recovered on 04Feb2021.

A 72-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 13:53 (at 72-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Spinal leak (Diagnosed with a spinal leak about 1-1/2 years ago. She said she has had spinal leaks, on and off, since that time.), ongoing Oral lichen planus (Stated she was diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus between 10-15 years ago), ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (Stated she was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at least 3 years before she was diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus. She said she had been tested for food allergies &amp; as long as she stayed away from gluten, chicken, tomatoes &amp; some other things, she did not have a problem with her rheumatoid arthritis. She said gluten, in particular,  triggered her rheumatoid arthritis.), Gluten (triggered her rheumatoid arthritis), fractured her L4 vertebrae in last summer 2020, sciatica from Feb2020 (pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020), Bone density issue. Stated her family has a history of autoimmune diseases, like Lupus. Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine, paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL PM, NDC Number: 50580-937-19, Lot Number: SLA006, Expiration Date: Aug2024); ibuprofen (ADVIL, UPC Number: 305730154604, Lot Number: EG1007, Expiration Date: Jul2023); gabapentin (&#34;ACI Health&#34;, Expiration Date of 05Mar2022). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EN6198) on 02Mar2021 (at 72-years-old) Intramuscular on left arm for covid-19 immunization but experience Left arm was sore, left arm soreness went away after 2-3 days. The patient previously took Flu vaccine but experienced Mouth sores. Reported she had both COVID-19 Vaccine doses. She said she got the typical side effects of a headache, chills, not feeling well, and her body was aching. She clarified those side effects started late the night of her second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (24Mar2021). She said those side effects were mild, and resolved in about 2 days. She said she didn&#39;t think much of those side effects, until the next day (25Mar2021), when the other side effects started (blacked out, lightheaded, equilibrium was off). She said her left arm was sore after her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t treat her left arm soreness, and the left arm soreness went away after 2-3 days. Reported on 25Mar2021 at about 11:30AM, she blacked out. She said she just sat down in a chair, and everything went black for a second. She said she then got really lightheaded, and her equilibrium was off. Reported she had spinal leaks, on and off, for the past 1-1/2 years. She clarified that her doctors didn&#39;t think the spinal cord leaks would be contraindicated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said all her doctors said it was up to her if she wanted to get the COVID-19 Vaccine because she previously had problems with the flu vaccine. She clarified she had a flu vaccine about 15 years ago, and the day after the flu vaccine, she got mouth sores, and the mouth sores got worse. She said her local doctors didn&#39;t know how to treat her mouth sores, so she went to the clinic. She said the clinic doctors told her she had Oral Lichen Planus, and the Oral Lichen Planus was caused by the flu vaccine she had received. She stated she did not have any information (NDC, Lot, &amp; Expiration Date) for the flu vaccine she received back then. She stated she has not had a flu vaccine since that time. Reported her spinal cord leaks caused equilibrium, and lightheadedness. She said she thought her second COVID-19 Vaccine exasperated her spinal cord leak symptoms because her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off, started on 25Mar2021 11:30. She said her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off was still going on. Reported she hurt more, too, in her L4 &amp; L5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body. She clarified she fractured her back (specifically her L4 vertebrae) last summer (2020), and her L4 vertebrae had since healed. She said she had a pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020. She clarified her L4 and L5 vertebrae move because she had 3 blood patches to treat her spinal cord leaks. She said when the blood patches were done a lot of force was used to stop the spinal leaks. She said the first blood patch caused her buttocks to really hurt. She said she had 2 more blood patches. She said she was not too sure about second blood patch, but with the 3rd blood patch, she was miserable. She said she had physical therapy weekly, and she may have to have her back fused. She said she had a bone density issue that apparently was mentioned in her medical records when she was in her 50s. She said she was never treated for her bone density issue until after she fractured her L4 vertebrae in 2020. No further details provided. Reported her last blood work was 3-4 months ago. No further details provided. Reported her Oral Lichen Planus was more pronounced since her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose (Mar2021). She clarified she started to get Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores a couple days after she received her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she can go months without having any issues, and then get the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores. She said she took medication to manage her Oral Lichen Planus. She said with the medication, the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores are gone within 24-48 hours. She said with her latest Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores, she put her medication on the mouth sores, and the mouth sores seemed to settle down, but the mouth sores didn&#39;t go away completely. She said the day before yesterday (03Apr2021), her Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores got worse again, and are staying that way, even with using the medication. Oral Lichen Planus Treatment: Stated she was applying Clobetasol Propionate Ointment UPS 0.05% to her mouth sores after she eats, or about 3-4 times a day. NDC Number: 51672-1259-6, Lot Number: 332450, Expiration Date: Aug2021. For other treatment she had medication she takes every day, and she continued to take the medication to help her symptoms. She said she had physical therapy twice a week for about 1-1/2 hours, as well as, doing physical therapy on her own. She clarified she does the physical therapy for her sciatica and vestibular issues, saying she was not steady on your feet. She said she does physical therapy about 4 hours a week. Reported her doctors told her she would not survive the Corona Virus if she were to get it because of her underlying health issues. No further details provided. Reported her doctors said there was no information reporting that the COVID-19 Vaccine was contraindicated in people with spinal cord leaks, and how the COVID-19 Vaccine would affect people with spinal cord leaks. She said she thought she may have been fighting things because the COVID-19 Vaccine was acting like the flu vaccine (when she first developed Oral Lichen Planus). She said she thought her symptoms after her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose  may have had something to do with her spinal cord leak because she had similar symptoms (lightheadedness &amp; equilibrium issues) with her spinal cord leak. She said with her spinal cord leak, she also had pain and loses her voice. No further details provided. The outcome of the events she just sat down in a chair, and everything went black for a second was recovered on 25Mar2021; headache was recovered in Mar2021; chills was recovered in Mar2021; not feeling well was recovered in Mar2021; body was aching/she hurt more, too, in her l4 &amp; l5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body was recovered in Mar2021; loses her voice was unknown; while for other events was not recovered.

A 73-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 around 13:00-14:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient got the vaccine this week on 06Jan2021 right after lunch/early afternoon. She had no issues. In the afternoon of 07Jan2021, she started getting a little dizzy and had a hard time focusing her sight. The patient also had neck and toe stiffness on 07Jan2021. She did not think about the vaccine until last evening of 07Jan2021. The hospital called to see how she was doing, and then it dawned on her. After, she took her blood pressure which was 126/68 with 81 pulse. She slept well last night of 07Jan2021. This morning on 08Jan2021 she had breakfast but still felt a little off kilter. It is like dizziness, not really dizzy, but more like her balance does not feel right. She was focusing better on 08Jan2021, but not like normal. The dizziness hit her on 07Jan2021 about 15:00. It had improved. She felt more at the time of the report, not really dizzy, but more like her balance did not feel right. It was earlier on 07Jan2021 around 14:00 she was on the ladder taking down her Christmas bows. She had no dizziness whatsoever. For neck and toes stiffness, she had one big toe that was arthritic and it did not seem to want to bend. She had been doing neck exercises which had helped. The outcome of dizziness, hard time focusing her sight, neck and toe stiffness were resolving, outcome of rest events were unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient reported an anaphylactic reaction  (throat swelling, trouble breathing) to ibuprofen. She also indicated she developed a rash all over her body to a flu vaccine in 1970s, attributed to her egg allergy. Due to her extensive allergies and the fact that she has not gotten a vaccine since 1970s, I would need to monitor her for 30 minutes. (Even though none of her allergies cross react with ingredients in covid Pfizer vaccine. I gave patient vaccine and had her sit in waiting  room to be monitored. After 5 or so minutes I noticed her head down, I asked if she was feeling okay she said yes just very tired. I asked if any trouble breathing she said no but her mouth feels dry. Another five minutes go by and patients head is down again, I again ask if she is okay she says yes just very tired and she wasn&#39;t before vaccine. I ask if any trouble breathing/swallowing, she said it&#39;s a little hard to swallow but she thinks its because her mouth is dry. I get patient a water and ask if she is okay if I give her a Benadryl. She says yes so I give her 50mg Benadryl by mouth. Another 5 minutes go by and again I have to ask patient how she was feeling, she said fine. I ask how her throat is, she says it just feels kind of tight. Due to this progression of allergic reaction (although slow, clearly progressing)  I told patient I will have to call for an ambulance. Paramedics showed up after 5-10 minutes and took care of patient. I relayed all this info to them as well as the dispatcher on the phone. Paramedics took patient to hospital conscious and breathing on her own.

Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine she developed new numbness and swelling in her tongue, along with numbness in her extremities. She was given 0.3 mg epinephrine per protocol and was then advised to be seen in the emergency department. Her symptoms resolved once she arrived at the emergency department. She was observed for a period of two hours without worsening symptoms and was then discharged. presented to the ED following pfizer vaccine ingestion. received epinephrine IM prehospital for report of tongue swelling and and numbness at the time. She was improved at the time of presentation to the ED. Observed for several hours and discharged home without recrudescent sx. Although cannot find objective evidence of tongue swelling, administration of epi prehospital with report of improvement of symptoms is suggestive that this was a true anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283, expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:02 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Seasonal Allergies (probably started in the last 4-5 years; reoccurs every year from about Oct through Mar), ongoing high blood pressure since like 2006 or 2004, ongoing Iliac artery stent placed started couple of years ago, anxiety from 2010 and ongoing (her cardiologist put her on Xanax around 2010-ongoing). Concomitant medication included ongoing alprazolam (XANAX) since 2010 for anxiety. She gets the flu shot every year and has never had a problem with the flu shot. She got her last flu shot in Oct2020, no adverse events with that or other flu shots historically. On the second dose of Pneumococcal vaccine, it swelled her arm up from the injection site all the way down to her wrist; she went to the urgent care for that. They gave her some medicine and eventually the adverse event went away. She experienced some side effects following that injection. The patient reported that in the morning of the 20Jan2021, she was weak and just kind of rested. She did not have any other side effects until 21Jan2021. At 5am on 21Jan2021, for the whole day she had a fast heart rate, 125bpm, she woke up with her heart rate up, fast heartbeat, then down to 110 and then just toggled a little bit, she had blurry eyes so she could not really focus her eyes, weakness and dizziness. These events continued all throughout 21Jan2021 but her heart rate came down, it was running in the 90s and she was weak all day. Her blood pressure was also up on 21Jan2021. She thinks the blurry eyes, with her eyes being squirrely was related to her heart rate being up and blood pressure being up. She feels like she recovered completely from these events by this morning 22Jan2021. She feels good, strong and her eyes are clear today, felt better than yesterday but not 100%. She has probably shrunk in height, her last known height was 5&#39; 9. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose as scheduled for 12Feb2021 in response to the side effects. Outcome of the event &#39;she has probably shrunk in height&#39; was unknown while the rest of the events was recovered on 22Jan2021.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

This 73-year-old female consumer reported that she received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number FL1284) on 10Jan2021 1:00pm at left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergic to latex. Concomitant drugs included Atenolol for Blood pressure high from 2011, Furosemide from 2011 as Diuretic, Alprazolam from 2011 for Sleeping and anxiety, Simvastatin from 2011, all were ongoing. The patient experienced a reaction after the first dose on 10Jan2021 that she became dizzy and felt tingling of her tongue. Every 15 minutes they checked her blood pressure for an hour. Her blood pressure was going up slightly. She was monitored by fire rescue and her blood pressure was rising but not dangerously high.  The fire rescue also checked her blood sugar (normal result) and other lab values and decided she did not need emergency room care and instructed her to take Benadryl when she got home. They felt she had a mild reaction.  The patient stated the dizziness came in waves and she felt as if she was going to faint. The dizziness went in waves where she felt like she was passing out. The tingling on her tongue felt similar to the allergic reactions she has had in the past to latex but without swelling. She did not have tongue swelling. She had tongue itching. It was like having a reaction to the latex gloves when you go to the dentist. Her symptoms only lasted for two hours. After a total of 2.5 hours she had no symptoms. Dizziness, tingling, and elevated blood pressure initially that went away after taking Benadryl. She was scheduled to receive second dose on 31Jan2021. The events was resolved on 10Jan2021.

                                                I woke around 4:45 this morning and I noticed my arm was sore so I got out of bed and had the chills. I wrapped up and made some hot coffee, and then made some hot tea. I was also drinking water in between as I felt thirsty but you still could not warm. I was shaking and shivering from the chills. I took two extra strength Tylenol,  and with  40 minutes I stopped shaking but I stayed wrapped up as I did not want to get cold again. I went and took my temperature and it was almost 102.  I also have a headache, it was like shooting pains in my head and now it feels like a achy fever. I also feel tired.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 06Feb2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Medical history included High blood pressure. Concomitant medications included losartan, atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) and vitamins. Patient was not pregnant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient woke up 1:30 am 07Feb2021very dry mouth, used restroom, felt very lightheaded, went back to room, next thing she heard was glass breaking. She had passed out hitting a table bumped head and back. Her boyfriend was with she helped she up. Said her legs went out from under her.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in Feb2021.

                                                About 20 minutes after vaccine, the right side of my face (including nose, some of my tongue) felt numb or tingly.   Very mild.   Symptoms disappeared within, say, a half hour and did not return.  The following morning I had fleeting head aches on right side - each lasting a&#39; second or so only, and several hours apart.   By the afternoon they disappeared.  I am having no other symptoms.   My arm never hurt at the injection site.   I&#39;m not even  concerned but feel I should mention this reaction because I will be getting a second shot on March 16.  Is it safe?  Again, I have no symptoms any longer and feel great.

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Patient presented today for second dose of COVID vaccine. She tolerated her first dose well. She has h/o elevated BP and &#34;flushed&#34; feeling with various meds including once when she was doing a bowel prep for a colonoscopy. We decided to monitor her for 30 minutes and she felt fine throughout. As she was walking to her car she felt &#34;flushed&#34; and a bit light headed so she returned to the monitoring area. Initial BP was 189/77, pulse 110, O2 sat 100%. We brought her to the back room so she could sit in a recliner and remove her mask. Subsequent BP 186/77, pulse 86 then 184/69, pulse 80 about 20 minutes later. O2 sat remained upper 90s to 100%.  She continued to report feeling &#34;flushed&#34; and noted pressure/pain behind her left eye so we elected to call EMS (and this was also patient request to go to the ED) so she could be evaluated. She drove herself to appointment. Her plan was to call her son to have him meet her at the ED. She left via ambulance in stable condition.

Morning after 1 PM second shot, my left eye was almost completely covered in blood.  My arm pit also very sore and found a bruise on the side of my left breast and also on my left hip.   I slept a lot and by the next day everything eased up.   After another day my eye was clear and bruises fading.  The last thing to go away was the soreness in my left arm pit.

A few hours following the vaccination, my eyes burned like crazy.  The day after my second dose of the vaccine, I became excessively fatigued.  My arm hurt, I had a very slight fever (99.2 and my normal temp in 97.6) and felt a general malaise.  I went to bed and after 10 hours of sleep felt much better the following day, although still fatigued.  However, the next day, my arm hurt to move it and I discovered swelling under my arm and my lymph node was enlarged.  The swelling went down after a couple of days and all of my symptoms were gone in about five days.

                                                Very next MORNING!  My blood sugar readings every morning had been running @ 100 .   HOWEVER, next morning after Covid shot, my blood sugar was 350.   It continued that way for days.  I started using more insulin the night before (when I usually take it).   So I HAD been taking only 45 units at night.  I was cautious and increased to 65 units on the 3rd night.  That reduced my morning blood sugar readings to 220.   Per my doctor&#39;s instructions, I have been taking that amount every night, but my blood sugar has only gone down to 175.   This was my MAIN concern.  But here are the other physical effects that have occurred since 2-25:  great thirst, Joints hurt, teeth hurt, confusion, headache, fatigue, sleeping almost all day - all of these days since the shot.  Something new started just last night (3-7-2021).   Both of my  legs hurt so much I could not fall asleep.  They still hurt this morning.  My joints ache in my hips, knees - Much worse than they normally do.

                                                1st Pfizer vaccine given Feb 4th;  2nd Vaccine received 9:30 a.m. March 25;   Side effect 1:  Never having had nose bleeds I had 8 minor nosebleeds after the 1st vaccine. (chalked it up to &#34;ND dry air).  March 24 at 1;30a.m. I awoke to a nose bleed my husband and I could not stop; went to ER and a catheter was placed in my nose  after an hour after they could not get it stopped. Catheter was removed next day.  Blood pressure 184/96 unusual for me range 120/80.  Side effect 2:  10 days after the 2nd vaccine I noticed loss of hearing in my right ear.  That has persisted but I have not taken any action on it.  My head is tender and I feel more &#34;off balance than normal&#34;.  Not sure if this coincidence or side effect.

She was asymptomatic for 15 minutes afterwards, but while driving home she developed tingling of her lips and the feeling of heat in her throat. She went back to the outpatient center where she had the vaccination, where they assessed her.  She was not hypoxemic, tachypneic, or hypotensive.  There was no visible angioedema. She had no rash or shortness of breath.  The vaccinations center administered Claritin and Pepcid and referred the patient here to the emergency department for evaluation. The vaccination occurred 1 hour ago now.  The patient says that she feels better, but continues to have the sensation of &#34;heat&#34; in her throat.  She has no history of prior allergic reactions.  She has no chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, rash, or itching.

                                                Got the vaccine and within 30-an hour she was seated, waiting and she developed a tingling/numbness on her bottom lip to the center of her lip.  It spread throughout the entire bottom lip.  Then it moved to the left hand corner of her mouth as well, and then moved up to the left side of her face to her eye, and then to the corner of the left hand of her head.  This is a tingly pressure, and it then developed into a hard headache concentrated in one spot.  She went into heavy sweating.  The pharmacist was watching her and came over to her, she was there for about an hour and a half.  She had a bottle of water trying to cool off, and her tongue was getting a bad taste in her mouth, and numbness in the back of her tongue.  The pharmacist gave her Benadryl to take and she sat there for a while and was starting to feel really shaky, and she thought she would go back to her apartment to get out of being around other people.  She was feeling weak to walk, and overwhelmingly tired.  Once she did get into her apartment she her taste buds felt dry.   After several days of this reaction, little by little it subsided, but the sweating and chills continue even up until today, 3/26/21.  She goes to bed dry and wakes up soaked from sweat due to profuse sweating.  She has been yawing a lot lately and if she does yawn she immediately has chills.  It&#39;s been back and forth with the chills/fever.  She can be perspiring on one end and the other end cold.  She tried to talk to her doctor but told her to seek out UC for her symptoms as he is too busy.    There is eye strain that is bothering her which leads her into wanting to sleep and sleeps for extended periods of time and really exhausted.  Has also had runny nose, hands and feet swelling.  Her right hand is kind of like a tingling/weakness sensation.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 18Jan2021 at 09:15, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. Yesterday morning (18Jan2021) at 9:15, the patient got her vaccine, and around 04:00 PM (also reported as 04:30 PM), yesterday afternoon, the patient started to rub the area around her mouth. And when she looked it in the mirror, it was a little red and it felt itchy. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) which helped a little, just one. And the patient put some diphenhydramine hydrochloride topical cream on it also. The patient was able to sleep last night and woke up this morning and the redness is gone. It&#39;s not itchy. The patient seemed to be fine, but she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the vaccine or not. It&#39;s not one of the typical side effects. The patient asked if it is safe for her to get the vaccine (second dose) or if she needs to ask them. The patient&#39;s second dose of vaccine is scheduled on 08Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events on 19Jan2021.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                I was fine the first day. The 2nd day I wasn&#39;t feeling well, my stomach was bothering me. At 8:30 PM I went to bed because I didn&#39;t feel good, I laid in bed for a few minutes and then jumped up because I began to violently vomit. After I vomited I felt weak, I was sitting with my back against the wall my husband came to check on me.  He walked away and when he came back I was unresponsive, laying on the floor and he said my eyes rolled in the back in of head. He called 911. I was unresponsive for about a 1-2 minutes. EMS arrived, by the time they had arrived I had crawled into bed, and they took my vitals and they were fine, they asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital but I declined as I was afraid to go. I went to sleep. The next day I felt weak and tired, I had a burning feeling in my stomach, I took some TUMS, I didn&#39;t much that day. I rested most of the next day. Yesterday I felt a little better and today I am fine. I have a doctor&#39;s appointment 2/26/2021 at 2PM to see the ARNP at my doctor&#39;s office.

I then began having peripheral flashing lights of all colors going every which way around my vision.  I rested for a few minutes and then checked it by attempting to read but could not keep the letters and words in order,.  This continued for 45 minutes. When I called my dr. They told me to go to the ED and get checked out.  ED Dr. checked for signs of stroke, which there were none. He felt it was related to vaccine.

                                                pain in chest through back; tongue swelled up; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; lot number EL9764/EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 01Feb2021 09:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing three stents in her artery, heart issue where they took test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, penicillin allergy, IV iodine allergy, allergy to pollens, inhalants, dust and animals. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin (DILANTIN), bacitracin;neomycin sulfate;polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and cefalexin (KEFLEX); all of which patient experienced allergies/ drug hypersensitivity. On 01Feb2021 09:45, immediately after receiving the vaccine, her tongue swelled up, she had difficulty swallowing, and she has a pain in her chest that went through to her back. The patient was sent and admitted to the ER and got an IV shot injection of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) that got tongue back down. She didn&#39;t need an Epi pen, it wasn&#39;t that bad. They took the test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative. The patient was advised by the head of ER that she shouldn&#39;t get the second shot because of the reaction. It could be more severe with the second dose he said. The outcome of the events was recovered on 01Feb2021.

Patient went to ENT doctor today, was advised to call CDC per ENT doctor. Spoke to pt&#39;s daughter because mom has lost 80% of her hearing and she is taking all of her calls. They went to audiologist for hearing test, then to ENT who prescribed Prednisone for 10days but was unsure about her situation and told her to call the CDC. Their main concern is does she take her 2nd shot and risk loosing more or all of her hearing if it was a result of the vaccine. The daughter said that they received new hearing aids a week before the vaccine. I told her that we will follow up with her in about a week to see if the steroids are helping and to find out the results from her ENT follow up appt.

The consumer reported two reports for two separate vaccine doses for the same patient. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot/batch number and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included advanced stages of Multiple Sclerosis, Diabetes, depressant, covid prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included diabetic meds (pills), anti-depressants, etc. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Dec2020 at age of 74 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced neurological setback and it wasn&#39;t terribly obvious at that time. Facility type vaccine was Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient (mother of the reporter) suffered a neurological setback following the first injection, although it wasn&#39;t terribly obvious at that time, in comparison to what occurred after she received the second vaccine. The patient suffered major neurological damage after the second vaccine; unable to speak, followed by an inability to move, chew, eat, etc. The reporter also noticed optical neuritis or changes in her eyes. Her right eye was bulging. Neither eye looked in the same direction, or able to track objects. The patient was currently in a long term acute hospital (pending clarification) with a tracheostomy and a food peg. She had advanced stages of Multiple Sclerosis. Reporter had since learned she had been advised by her MS doctors NOT to receive flu shots. The reporter had known this and would not have listened to the doctors at the nursing home, who recommended she receive the Covid Vaccine. This was serious. The reporter was awaiting medical records, which would provide exact dates, times, etc of the administration of the vaccines. Adverse events resulted in Disability or permanent damage. Known allergies: Apparently the Covid Vaccine by Pfizer. If treatment adverse events: unknown. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included unknown covid test: negative in Jan2021 (post vaccination). The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I had a fierce itching and burning of my face. I asked my husband if he would take me to the emergency room. He then suggested that he remembered having prednisone tablets. Without them I know I would have gotten much worse. I couldn&#39;t get in to see my dermatologist until another day later. They gave me a 40ml steroid shot. It called everything down but took another week to subside. I&#39;ve had a similar reaction to the Fluzone shot back in Sept, 2020.

                                                Chills; Irritation in throat; Swelling of tongue; Unable to swallow solids; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6202), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 25Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported; She takes other unspecified medications, though declined to provide details. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (Lot EM9809) on 04Feb2021 as first single dose for covid-19 immunization and hydrochlorothiazide and experienced anaphylactic reaction on an unspecified date (reported as years ago).   The patient experienced the following medically significant events:  irritation in throat on 27Feb2021 with outcome of recovered; swelling of tongue on 27Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered; unable to swallow solids on 27Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered; chills on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the reporting nurse received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. She received the first dose on 04Feb2021. She received the second dose on 25Feb2021. 48 hours after the second dose she developed a really sore throat way down in the back of her throat. Her tongue also started swelling. She took diphenhydramine (ASSURED) 50mg. Her tongue was swollen the next day and she was unable to swallow solids.  She went to a Covid clinic and was prescribed a diphenhydramine mouthwash. She was still unable to swallow. She has been taking diphenhydramine and Ibuprofen. It waxes and wanes.  She had to take diphenhydramine to go to sleep. She thinks it is a reaction to the vaccine. She read about the ingredients and is not allergic to anything in the vaccine. She clarified that she did not have a sore throat. Her throat was irritated. It felt like pop rocks in the back of her throat. She saw a provider on 01Mar2021. She thinks her histamine level is too high. She also had chills last night, date unspecified. She had them once since 27Feb2021 and again last night. She was unable to confirm if they are ongoing or resolved. She had to turn up her electric blanket to 8. She was not shaking but just had chills.  Years ago she had an anaphylactic reaction to hydrochlorothiazide. This felt similar to that. She was walking around fine and then started having swelling. She did not have difficulty breathing. She hoped it was not anaphylaxis. The diphenhydramine mouthwash was a compound of lidocaine, diphenhydramine and Maalox. The ratio was 1:1:1. The diphenhydramine 50 mg was a liquid children&#39;s allergy relief medication. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as aforementioned. Relatedness of drug to reaction for irritation in throat, swelling of tongue, unable to swallow solids and chills per primary source reporter  of assessment was reported as related. The outcome of irritation in throat was recovered on 28Feb2021; the outcome of swelling of tongue  and unable to swallow solids was not recovered; the outcome of chills was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of  irritation in throat, swelling of tongue, unable to swallow solids  due to temporal relationship and the known product safety profile.  The clinical presentation is suggestive of a severe allergic reaction, involving the tongue and throat.  There is limited information provided in this report.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Eye swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.   A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 08Mar2021 (at age of 74-year-old)(Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included detached retina, cataract, eye surgery on 12Feb2021, and hit the head on the freezer door. Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; potassium chloride taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamins NOS (MULTIVITAMINS) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. There was no History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect or additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  The patient experienced eye swelling on 08Mar2021. The reported seriousness criteria was medically significant. The events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit.  Time the Vaccination Was Given: 2:15-3:00 pm. The patient had the vaccine then she went to her retina specialist right after, she had a detached retina prior to receiving the vaccine. At the retina appointment before the vaccine she didn&#39;t have edema within her eye, at this appointment she had new onset edema inside of her eye. The edema was on the right, the vaccine was on the left. The patient knows there are lymph nodes around the eye and she has a weird body. The patient wants to know if other people have experienced this. There is edema inside the eye. The patient wonders if the vaccine interacted with the oil given during the retina exam. The patient had cataract surgery done and then had a hole in her retina following the surgery. The hole got worse and she had to go for surgery on 12Feb2021, then she had 3 month appointments.  The patient didn&#39;t not know if she still has the eye swelling, she went back to her retina doctor on 19Apr2021. The retina doctor put her on eye drops after they found the eye swelling. The patient mentioned that she stopped the eye drops that she was taking after her surgery a week before she received the vaccine. The patient hit her head on the freezer door right before her retina detached, the doctors said that it did not cause the retina to detach but she thought it was related because she hit her head really hard.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of eye swelling (eye swelling). The outcome of event was unknown. The patient thought this eye swelling may be related to the vaccine but she is unsure.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between eye swelling and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

                                                I had two symptoms that are normal, they were on the list of side effects, I had soreness on my left arm, I couldn&#39;t sleep on my left arm due to this soreness. This started the day the soreness started. The following day and up till now I felt very tired and like I needed to take a nap. Due to work I have not been able to nap. On Sunday I noticed I had a fever blister on the right side of face, under my lip by my chin. It looked like a herpes blister. I rarely get them unless there is a serious stressor to my body or if my body is emotionally stressed. Valacyclozir I took 4 of those in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening after noticing them. I put a cream on the blister. On Tuesday or Wednesday 3 or 4 days after the vaccine I felt a pain in my gum by back two teeth, the gums were very painful when I brushed my teeth or put my tongue on it.  I went to the dentist Friday the 22nd, however the dentist said it was intraoral herpes that he believes it is looked to the vaccine. Dr. believes the COVID vaccine activated the dormant herpes in my system . He said says it is located over the Greater Palatine Foramen.  The herpes on my chin went away. I still feel light sensitivity and fatigued. Dr recommended to see my dermatologist. Either the 22nd or 23rd I had a virutal appointment with my dermatologist. She recommended I take 4 Valacyclozir in the AM and PM. And then 1 day for 10 days. Both doctors recommended not getting the 2nd dose until the herpes vaccine goes away. Once it goes away they suggested taking the Valacyclozir before taking the 2nd dose. I am still not feeling normal. My dentist said he was going to consult a group of dentists to see if any other dentists have seen the correlation between the COVID vaccine and activating the herpes virus.  I plan to consult my PCP about if I should delay the 2nd dose.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 13:45 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension and atrial fibrillation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL), diltiazem (DILTIAZEM), rivaroxaban (XARELTO) and estrogen/methyl te. The patient previously had the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020. The patient stated, &#34;I woke from sleep about 12 hours later (10Jan2021) with rigors, muscle aches, head ache and pain in my inner ears as well as photophobia and feeling of exhaustion. The rigors had resolved by 8am but other symptoms persisted. I was too weak to walk further than the bathroom. I was able to consume only warm liquids, although I had no nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Note that since onset post infectious irritable bowel symptoms in February after visiting a city, weeks before the pandemic was recognized, I have had very abnormal but not absent sense of taste and smell, making me wonder whether I was infected in February without the usual symptoms.&#34; The patient recovered from rigors on 10Jan2021, outcome of the event weakness was unknown while other events were not recovered.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

                                                About 11 am I was masked in church and developed a tickle in my throat.  I cleared my throat to no relief.  I took 2 cough drops. About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

Lose of appetite, constipation and nausea.. It lasted for 4 days and on Wednesday I called my medical care giver and she said that I probably had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and to not take the next dose, as this had been my first. I am still, periodically week and dizzy, and still have little appetite.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

I drank fluids thinking that might help.  The symptoms got stronger in a few hours when my heart beat was irregular and only 51-57bpm. I laid down and took my blood pressure which was normal and heart beat became normal. Later I could tell my lips and tongue were swollen. I live alone and had no way to get to the hospital so  late at night . I called my primary doctor to see if I could be a walk-in and the nurse said to go to the ER immediately.  my neighbor brought me. There I was given steroids and Benadryl and monitored for a couple of hours. I am on prednisone for 5 days total and was told to take two Benadryl if symptoms return. I will take it now, because my throat still feels funny.

PLEASE NOTE: I am allergic to Cipro and I found that there is a common ingredient in Cipro and the Covid vaccines: Polyethylene Glycol Maybe there&#39;s a correlation?

                                                When I was outside leaving the facility, I noticed a tight knot in my chest.Less than a half an hour later,I had pulled over in the park and was trying to fix myself. Soon I realized breathing was not helping. It didn&#39;t seem to work. Exercise did not help. I started getting worse. I had difficulty getting back to my car I was fatigued my vision was getting blurry.My thinking was not sure. I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get my seat down in my car. Finally I got it down enough so I could recline. Then I decided to try to use my I watch pull up my Hart app.I measured over 155 bpm. I noticed that I was feeling better as my heart rate decreased to 141 bpm. I decided to drive home and left my car seat reclined. When I got h I stayed laying down in my bed for two hours because when I tried to get up I was way too dizzy. I&#39;ve been unable to reach my primary care doctor when I got home.  I left a voice messages. I called my sisters to tell them what was wrong and while on the phone St. Luke&#39;s was trying to call me and then my sister said she had to hang up because St. Luke&#39;s was trying to call her.  I got up when I heard a knock on the door. It was the police. St. Luke&#39;s had called the police.  My heart rate was normal before I got up Almost 3 hours after my shot.  I spent the rest of the day and the next morning trying to find out what happened to me. I have spent days trying to get warnings about what to look out for.  Finally I found this on your website as well as the handout I should&#39;ve had before the vaccine because I would&#39;ve known what was happening to me and what to do.

I haven&#39;t had a cold sore in many, many years and have only gotten one if I have been in the sun too long or have a high fever.  I called the doctor on call the following morning  and asked for a prescription of acyclovir. Starting it that late resulted in not stopping the progression of the cold sore. Also had runny nose (haven&#39;t had a cold since masking started last year), and a red swollen arm..still red and swollen two days later and a terrible headache (started the day after injection and still bad today which is two days after).

                                                6 hours after 2nd dose of vaccine I could feel my body starting to react.  Aches and pains increased as the time went on.  I went to bed and around 12 hours after the injection I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt like someone was hitting my head with an ax. The pain was  excruciating.  I went through the night with the pain feeling like my head would explode.  In the morning I was totally exhausted and my body hurt all over.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  Put warm cloths on my head and face.  My sinus hurt, my teeth hurt. my throat hurt. my eyes hurt.  Awful!!! Spent the entire day in bed.  I continued taking Tylenol every 6 hours.  It did help a little.  By Friday I was seeming to feel a little better.  Still have mild headache and body aches and stomach upsets; but better than the first 24-36 hours.  Hoping to continue to improve each day.  Never expected any side effects as severe.  Most people said sore arm and feeling tired.  I do hope the worse is over.

I took a rescue inhaler to see if it would help. I stayed in bed all day wednesday. I coughed all night, I am on O2 all night. I seem to be parched, mouth is dry, drinking a lot of water. Thursday was just as bad, I wasnt feeling well. the breathing gets better a little every day but I am coughing up green mucus so I called my pulmonologist and he called in an antibiotic.

It made me wonder if the vaccine was having some effect on my brain.  I also woke up at least 8 times during the same night with my mouth so dry it almost had no feeling in it.   Neither of these events has ever happened to me before.  I don&#39;t dream about strangers and I don&#39;t wake up so frequently needing water.  So I don&#39;t know what to attribute it to except the vaccine since it was the only thing different.  I had a sore arm with the first dose but that was all that happened.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot number: EN6198, expiration date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. There were no problems, no symptoms, no pain or nothing on the day of vaccination. On 13Mar2021, the patient started experiencing swelling of the lip at around 08:30 or 09:00 and itching and swelling on the throat. She didn&#39;t wake up then, she went to sleep and she slept until about 05:45 and she thought it would just go away but there was much more swelling. She took Benadryl but she is concerned about the swelling, it was still there. She took another Benadryl at 04:00 on Sunday and she took one the previous night at 12 o&#39;clock and the swelling has diminished a lot but it was not gone away all together. She was concerned because of 2 reasons, one she was due for another shot in a couple weeks and another reason was she wanted to know if it came from the vaccine. She clarified that the swelling was on her lips, mainly the left side pretty much of her lips. It started with the bottom lip and it was kind of so now that it was the top and bottom, it was both lips on the left side. She gave a lot of thought to this and that night she did have some frozen blueberries and bananas. She never ate blueberries on their own she usually puts them in oatmeal or something like that, so she thought maybe it could be the results of the blueberries since she has never had that. The patient asked whether lip swelling was an expected side effect and whether there was any issue with receiving one dose instead of the two doses.  Limited information was available over the call.
