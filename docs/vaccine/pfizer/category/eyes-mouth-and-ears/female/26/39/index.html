                                                By evening, arm around the injection site grew increasingly painful, to the point where it hurt to move or touch (not unbearable but more soreness than any other injection I&#39;ve ever received). Over night contracted a fever, by the time I was able to get up to measure it (around 3:45 AM) it was 99.5 degrees, and broke by 5 AM. Had fever dreams prior to waking around 3 AM, and had chills for the remainder of the night. Felt  achy and a little unsteady for the rest of the day but was fully recovered by 12/31

Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction. I have an exercise bike at home, and tried to work out but had to stop after only half an hour of very low effort biking because I couldn&#39;t get a deep breathe. usually I can bike for an hour at high intensity no problem and have never had to stop because I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

This 28-year-old female nurse (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3246) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation on 11Jan2021 at 4:30 pm. Relevant history included contraception. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. Concomitant drug included ongoing ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING) for contraception for years. The patient experienced a headache, back ache, nausea and was almost passing out. She had the first dose of the vaccine on the 11Jan2021 at 4:30 PM and was in bed around 10:00 that night.  She woke up at 5:00 AM on 12Jan2021 and didn&#39;t feel great, her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine and she was nauseated at 5:30, which was not that horrible. She took some Tylenol. Then she got to work and around 9:00 she felt like she was going to get sick. She had horrendous nausea, chills, weakness, eye pain, headache/ head pain, and back pain. Her clothes hurt because the body aches were so bad. She felt like she was going to pass out, like a vasovagal. She went to urgent care because her manager didn&#39;t think it was side effect. She went and got swabbed (result unknown), whatever. She had a fever then. They told her it was a reaction to the vaccine. Her temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit when she went to Urgent care. She would say the fever started at 12:30PM on 12Jan2021. She did not know if fever would be ongoing because she was taking fever reducer and it was working. The events weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain were reported as serious since medically significant. The nausea was better around 2:00PM. The outcome of event nausea, Chills was and Weakness was resolved on 12Jan2021.  The outcome of events eye pain, head pain, and back pain was resolving. The outcome of event &#39;her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine&#39; was recovering. The outcome of fever was unknown. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events, weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain, and the administration the suspect vaccine, BNT162B2.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Estimated due date: 03/17/2021 On the day of the vaccine during observation I had tingling in my mouth, numbness in tongue and I just used my Benadryl and it eased the symptoms. But at night I started wheezing, had sweats and chills, did not check my temperature but I had pretty severe chills that night. In the morning I checked no fever, but still chills, severe cough and sore throat.. Headache and fatigue.  All got worse more severe on Saturday and then I decided to go get tested for Covid on the Care Clinic. I had a known exposure to COVID before I got the vaccine around  01/04/21 - my husband who tested positive on the 6th) I tested positive. All symptoms continued (except the tingling on the mouth it stopped on the 8th) and I saw my OB-GYN on the 11th due to a low amniotic fluid - I had an ultrasound at the facility and was referred to MD and saw him on the 11th as well.  Now I lost my sense of taste and smell. The chills have subsided a little bit and so the headache, but fatigue, congestion and cough are still there. I had increased intermittent shortness of breathe but could be the baby&#39;s position.

                                                I received the COVID Vaccine yesterday (1/24/21) around 12:10pm. I experienced no effects while waiting the allotted 30 minutes. The next morning, January 25th 2021, I started to experience arm soreness and blurry vision. The blurry vision is worse in my left eye. My vision has not improved after waking up, taking a shower and putting saline drops in both eyes. The best way to describe the sensation is hazy, blurry and sometimes double vision.

A 29-year-old female non-pregnant patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) intramuscular at the left arm on 30Dec2020 10:00 (lot number and expiry date unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a workplace clinic. Medical history included hidradenitis suppurativa. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included unspecified other medication. The patient received first dose of hepatitis vaccine in the left arm on 15Dec2020 (29 years old) for immunization which was within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 07Jan2021 07:15, the patient experienced hemifacial spasms on the right side of face. The right side of face tightens to the point her eye closes, mouth pulls up and cheeks pulls up as well along with a weird sound in the ear and pulsating in the neck. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: unknown results in Jan2021. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient received treatment of muscle relaxer, medrol dose pack. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Follow-up activities are possible, information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the hemifacial spasms and other reported events  due to temporal relationship  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including results of Head CT scan, EMG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

                                                Dizziness, Lightheaded, Chills, the first time I had to stop because couldn&#39;t drive, I had spasm&#39;s around the injection site, Generalized Numbing, the symptoms of the fisrt dose lasted one week. I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

                                                periorbital edema, lip swelling Narrative: ED note: This is a 29 year old employee who got her COVID vaccine yesterday. This morning she noticed facial puffiness, mostly around her eyes. No swelling of lips, toungue, no trouble swallowing or speaking, no swelling of throat, no SOB, no n/v or dizziness. Here she had some mild periorbital puffiness that I would not be aware of if she did not point it out to me. There is no swelling of her lips, airway and no SOB or problems with her voice. Her symptoms are improving in the ER. I think it is unlikely that this delayed symptom is related to the vaccine, however, she also states she had some swelling of the right side of her lip yesterday (none today), so I&#39;m going to prescribe her an epi-pen.

                                                About 12 hours of receiving my second dose I started to get really bad chills. Nothing could keep me warm and I had a fever of 102.  I had muscle aches  as if I just went through a rigorous workout. I had zero appetite but I?m not sure if that was due to side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. When I did finally eat something that evening I could barely taste it, I ate it but my taste buds were faintly picking up the flavors. Again I don?t know if it was because of the side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. The following day, Saturday 01/09/21 I only had chills which would come and go. I did not have fever and my appetite was back. Now today, 01/10/21 I feel my usual self.

Was wheeled to ED where they left me in the waiting room for two hours, not seen by a provider, before being told I was &#34;fine&#34; and sent home.  On 1/9/2020 I began experiencing widespread bodily itch, no hives or swelling that included in and around my mouth. Took cirtirizine and symptoms were alleviated.

                                                Within seconds of vaccine administration, I felt flushing of my upper and lower extremities as well as muffling in my right ear. My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

Around 2100 the same night, rapidly progressing paresthesia of complete left face without obvious facial palsy yet (numbness happened over the course of about 30min to the point where I had no perception of touch in the left face).  At this point I took 60mg of prednisone and went to bed. When I woke up, the paresthesia/stiffness was less and progressively so since finishing a course of prednisone.   Concerned that this could have been a bells palsy reaction to the vaccine.

A 30-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number Ej1685) at a single dose at 09:45 AM 07Jan2021 at left arm for Covid-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had her first dose of Pifzer Covid-19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 at 12:00 PM at left arm, and experienced very mild reactions which included mild pain at injection site and runny nose/sneezing day after vaccine. The paitent had a medical hisotry of rash to penicillin as a child. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to her first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the evening of second vaccine (around 17:00), pain and stiffness radiated from injection site all the way down arm, into breast, and middle of back. She started having chills. Around 10 hours after dose chills became somewhat violent despite being under 4 blankets. Severe headache also started. In the middle of the night to go to bathroom, she collapsed on the way back and was unable to get up for about 20 minutes. She also suffered from tachycardia overnight. her baseline heart rate runs in 60s- 70s, but was in 110s-120s (based on Apple Watch monitoring). Day after vaccine, she was extremely fatigue entire day and spent all but a few hours in bed. Arm pain mostly gone. Headache was very strong and persistent through the day. On second night chills not as bad but still occurred overnight. HR still elevated in 80s overnight. Morning of day 2 still had headache and fatigue. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcome of collapse and unable to get up for 20minutes, pain and stiffness radiating from injection site all the way down arm,into breast, and middle of back was resolved, chills and tachycardia was resolving, headache, fatigue was not resolved. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The reporter considered that the events was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile, causality between events fainting, violent chills and severe headache and BNT162B2 ((Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

She clarified she has never had a reaction to a vaccination before. The patient received the vaccine last 20Dec2020 and has reported to have blurriness on the right eye with consistent optic neuritis since 24Dec2020. She has already consulted with an ophthalmologist who said her case was interesting and referred her to Pfizer. She is scheduled to have her second dose on 10Jan2021 and is asking if she should still take it. She also mentioned that she read up on transverse myelitis that may be related to her condition and is asking for any information we may have on this. Doctor reporting she is having a possible adverse event to the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient clarified she received the COVID-19 Vaccine on Sunday, 20Dec2020 at approximately 1:00PM. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered at her employer. Doctor reported she is experiencing blurry vision in her right eye only, consistent with optic neuritis in Dec2020 (Medically significant). She said her right eye blurry vision gets worse after working out or showering. She said she has read some medical information that states some kind of autoimmune reaction, like transfer myelitis, may occur after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient asked if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine, clarifying she is scheduled to receive her second dose on 10Jan2021. Clarified she started experiencing the right eye blurry vision on either 24Dec2020 or 25Dec2020.

She said the ophthalmologist referred her to see a neurologist, and to get a MRI of her head. She clarified her MRI appointment is on 19Jan2021. She clarified her ophthalmologist called her back 2 hours after she left her appointment. She said the ophthalmologist told her he found what she was experiencing to be interesting, as to when she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, and the start of her right eye blurry vision, and that he wanted her to get further evaluation. She said the ophthalmologist performed visual field testing, and took a fancy picture of her retina. No further details provided. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. No Vaccine Administered at Military Facility. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none.

                                                I felt flushed and light headed after receiving the vaccine but as the day went on I felt worse. By 2030 I had severe full body chills and could not stop shaking. I had a severe headache/migraine. Every muscle in my body hurt. This continued on for the entire night. Got tested for COVID the next morning with the rapid results and the symptoms continued with the muscle aches and severe headache. Vision became blurry and I became very dizzy. Slept for 8 hours during the day on 1/7/2021 and then slept another 12 hours that night. The body aches and headaches continued until 1/8/2021 at which the symptoms finally subsided

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

                                                Jan 4, 2021 received shot at work in morning around 11:00 am- felt fine at work all day. Around 7:00 that night began to have back pain, fever reached up to 102 around 2:00 am and took Tylenol. Felt very weak, headache, difficulty walking and decreased balance. On Jan 5, 2021 still had back ache and headache. On Jan 6, 2021 I felt better and began to have abdominal pain after eating dinner. I assumed it may be because of eating more then I had in past few days and did not attribute to much but the pain gradually increased to a strange burning/pressure across my upper abdomen that night. Very nauseous and ran low grade fever (99.45). Next morning I had less diffuse pain and could localize it to right lower quadrant.

I decided to go to the ER to get a covid test because I was scheduled to work that day and I did want to make sure I was not positive due to the loss of taste but if I was not working that day I would not have got medical care. I did have loss of taste for some more days but after that it was resolved (around 3 days).

Notified nurse that gave me vaccine, several other nurses came over and helped me into recliner and laid me back and took vitals. Vitals are stable. I quickly began to feel better (within 5 minutes of being reclined). Still had the numbness and tingling. I laid in recliner for 30 minutes, then sat up for 10 minutes before leaving. I drank water and ate 2 rice krispies while in recliner. Numbness and tingling improved, but lingered throughout the day and was gone next morning.

At approximately four hours post-vaccination my right eye had mild blurriness to my vision. The vision resolved within a few hours but the altered right-sided sensations continued for 6 days, gradually improving.  The lightheadedness and dizziness that required cool clothes and elevated feet resolved enough to stand after 30 minutes.

                                                Patient reports that she did not have any issues after the first Covid19 Pfizer vaccine but 5 minute after her second dose she felt like it was hard to swallow. She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

She really didn?t think anything of it and did not report it to anyone or take any medication for it.  On 1/12/2021 she received the 2nd dose.  On day 7 of her vaccine she developed hives on her lower extremities. She took Benadryl that day and they improved, but did not got away.  On day 8 the hives reapproved and she took a dose of Claritin and that got her through working.  On day 9 (yesterday) the hives have migrated from just her lower extremities to her arms and shoulders.  She took both Zyrtec and Benadryl yesterday, but she is not getting any relief.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

                                                Within the first 12 hours I developed a fever of 102 - 103 degrees farenheit and chills with headache and substantial fatigue. The chills went away after the first day. The 2nd day I still had a fever. Day 3 I had significant nausea in conjunction with headache. These symptoms have continued from days 4 - today, day 11 post vaccine. While they are improving, after the initial fever/ chills my symptoms translated to into seemingly hormonal with nausea, strong food aversions, headaches (that felt hormonal) and 4&#43; days with substantial constipation and fatigue. It has mirrored the sickness I experienced with both pregnancies however I am not pregnant. I am still experiencing a mixture of fatigue,  headaches, nausea and food aversions (food still does not taste normal).

                                                With in 10 mins of receiving  1st dose, I started to feel hot and light headed, my body became very hot, I started to sweat and then my throat started to dry up and close. I notified the provider on watch that was monitoring me during my 15 mins after injection and as the walked me to the room I became more and more dizzy, my throat continued to swell and close, my mask was removed where my face was covered with a rash and hives . The dr. Gave me 50 mg benedryl, and a shot of epinephrine.  After wards 911 was called, my heart rate was eventually brought down with the epinephrine as my symptoms began to be controlled. An inhaler was administered because I was short of breath. 3 hours later I was stabilized. I then was recommended to go to urgent care rather the emergency room since the wait was 13 hours to be monitored at the local hospital MLK. I went to urgent care near my home at Hoag hospital and they monitored me and gave me a steroid injection IM. I was discharged with an epi pen just in case abs to take benedryl every 6 hours . The following morning 1/8/21, at 8 am the swelling of my throat retuned I became light headed abs my tongue became numb. I was taken to fountain valley hospital where an IV was started, 500 mg of iv benedryl, another epinephrine injection was given abs I remained under surveillance for another 6 hours. They stated that a lot of people are coming with reoccurring episodes of anaphylaxis after the phizer injection.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

A 33-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number EK9231), on 06Jan2021 14:30 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK5730) on 19Dec2020 09:45 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. On 06Jan2021 at 23:00, started at night of day one, the patient experienced severe headache. The patient experienced also heaviness in the head when she woke up next day (07Jan2021) and had some hot/spicy sensation around eyes area (07Jan2021). The patient needed to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) to get some relieve and she did not even have good appetite during lunch time on day 2 (07Jan2021). On unspecified date the patient had no fever and her body was cold; occasionally some nauseous sensation but didn&#39;t throw up. Eyes feel so tired and hard to concentrate. Hopefully those symptoms go away soon as days pass since it bothered patient sleep. The patient had a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient took also guaifenesin (MUCINEX). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264 and Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 17:45 at 33-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; with no other vaccines administered within four weeks of the bnt162b2 administration.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to 16Feb2021.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, vision has been off/ vision is blurry (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, numbness and tingly/burning sensation in right leg (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, brain fog (medically significant) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which required a physician office visit. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, she began having symptoms on the following Saturday and was seen by her doctor and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated she has reported this via VSafe and the Pfizer website. The patient also reported other symptoms that have not been reported as follows: had tingling in both legs, brain fog, and vision has been off. The patient was not sure if it was related to the vaccine or steroids. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The patient had been on a steroid, so she did not know if she should wait to get the second dose. The patient just stopped the steroid on 16Feb2021, and the second dose was scheduled for 23Feb2021.  The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

                                                Since the vaccine I have been having right sided hearing loss. Two days after my first dose I felt like I was underwater when talking to people, as their speech was distorted. I also felt pressure in my ear, as if it was filled with fluid, and was unable to &#34;pop&#34; my ears. I was evaluated by an ENT and there was no infection or fluid in my ear. It started to get better a little.  After my second dose, the symptoms worsen. My hearing loss was back worse than the original time and this time I had tinnitus constantly. I also had chills, fevers, myalgia, back pain, and headaches.

                                                I had dizziness/lightheaded 10 minutes after dose. Dizziness went away 40 minutes later. 24 hours after dose had body aches. 2 days after dose I had blurred vision in Rt eye and then noticed that Rt eye was fully dilated and Lt eye was normal. Rt eye not responding to light. Went to ED and had 2 CT scans that were normal. They sent me where I had a third CT scan which was normal. I saw ophthalmology and my optic nerve was normal and eyes looked good, but Rt eye still didn&#39;t react to light. they ruled out pharmacological and said that it is something neurological. They still don&#39;t know exactly what is going on. While at the hospital, I started having urinary retention and now have a foley placed. I have follow ups with neurology, urology and ophthalmology and have orders for MRI of brain and neck.

This 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 at 08:00AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was received on 16Dec2020 at 7:40 AM at single dose. Vaccine location was in the left arm. The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 34-years-old. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ongoing fluticasone proprionate (FLONASE) for seasonal allergy taking for two years. On 17Dec2020, COVID-19 PCR test was negative.  On 04Jan2021 at night, she experienced myalgia, fever, chills, back pain and started with a constant ringing in her right ear and the hearing loss that worsened from before (started on 18Dec2020 after first dose, see AER # 2021012126). Start date of constant ringing in right ear was 05Jan2021. The events resulted in Physician Office visit. Hearing loss in right ear worsened and constant ringing in right ear were reported serious as medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious. She went to see an ENT doctor and get a hearing test. The hearing test showed moderate hearing loss and speech clarity of 96% in her left ear compared to 52% in the right ear. They don&#39;t know if it is permanent. She is currently being treated with 80mg of Prednisone daily by mouth and getting dexamethasone injections to her middle eardrum. All of these effects have resolved except the hearing loss and ringing in her ear.   All the events were considered related to the vaccine per reporter.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 35-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose via an unknown route on the right side on 21Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included intermittent hives. Concomitant drug included ongoing cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) 5 mg for intermittent hives. The reporting nurse practitioner saw a patient on 31Dec2020 who was vaccinated on 21Dec2020 and had a Bell&#39;s Palsy reaction (reported as not serious). She did some research and saw no more incidents in the general population but she wanted to report this. She also wanted to get more information on if the patient should proceed with dose number 2 of the vaccine. The patient developed the Bell&#39;s Palsy within 5 minutes after getting the vaccine. She thought it was because she was anxious to get the vaccine, so she brushed it off. The Bell&#39;s Palsy was still occurring but per the patient it had improved. On exam she did not have any weakness, facial droop or dumbness with sharp or dull testing. The patient perceived it along the face still and the arm. The reporting nurse practitioner said that the arm was probably not Bell&#39;s Palsy, but more related to getting the vaccine in the arm and it hits a nerve. Patient stated that her smile was also unequal and it was difficult for her to close her right eye, although now (as of 31Dec2020) she can. Her right eye was irritated a little dry. Regarding treatment, the patient was started on steroids on 31Dec2020. She did not start her on an anti-viral as she did not want it to impact her immunity to the vaccine. The patient also complained of right sided ear pain. She was unsure if that was related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy, but it was also on the right side. There was fluid in the ear but no infection. The pain was still ongoing.  The patient also mentioned numbness in a small area of her tongue when she first got the vaccine. This was still ongoing. Outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy was resolving. Outcome of the event numbness in a small area of her tongue, right sided ear pain was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.     The reporting nurse practitioner stated that this was not serious as this was a mild case and was thankfully resolving. The reporting nurse practitioner comment that nothing of history was relevant besides for the last several months (as of 31Dec2020) the patient had been taking 5mg of cetirizine hydrochloride for intermittent hives. She wondered if she had not been taking it how she would have reacted or if the reaction would have been more severe.    Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                After vaccination I felt diaphoretic and dizzy. After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

I took tylenol and motrin to help with the pain.

A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 25Dec2020, the patient felt extremely tired (fatigue). On 28Dec2020, the patient had headache and minor cough noticed. On 29Dec2020, the patient experienced back pain and she said that it felt like sunburn soreness more than anything else. She said that she literally slept 3 days in a row (29Dec2020, 30Dec2020, and 31Dec2020).  On 31Dec2020, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed dizziness. On 01Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea and lost her sense of taste. COVID-19 virus test was found positive on 01Jan2021.The patient recovered from back pain, sunburn and sleepy on 31Dec2020, recovered from tiredness on 01Jan2021, recovered from nausea and dizziness on 06Jan2021. Clinical outcome of the events, smell loss, cough, headache, and loss of taste was recovering. Final clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test with symptoms was unknown at time of this report. The case was assessed as serious (medically significant). She is scheduled to get 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) on 13Jan2021 and is wanting to know if she is supposed to get it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                started having a lot of left eye pain/he diagnosed her with Scleritis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) a Nurse Practitioner, who reported for herself.  A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EJ1685 also reported as ES1685), intramuscular in left deltoid on 24Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety diagnosed years ago, maybe when she was 23. Concomitant medication included ongoing celecoxib (CELEXA) for anxiety started about a year, or year and a half ago. She did not take other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. She had no recent labs. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced scleritis. Event was described as follows: patient got her first COVID vaccine on 24Dec2020 and on 02Jan2021 she started having a lot of left eye pain. She went to her Ophthalmologist and he diagnosed her with Scleritis. She had no history of anything with her eyes or any vascular or autoimmune issues; no eye disorder history or rheumatology history. Patient is due to get her second dose of the vaccine on 14Jan2021, and she spoke with her primary care doctor and her ophthalmologist, and neither of them have any answer on if she should get the second dose or not, they did not have much guidance for her as this was such a new product. Patient reported that scleritis was persisting, but it has improved and she was on Prednisone eye drops. Event scleritis was considered serious as Medically significant because of what it is and what it can do, but this was not a severe case (as reported). Final outcome of scleritis was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported scleritis was more likely an intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Shortly after getting out of the shower I became weak, ears started blocking, and started to have tunnel vision. Progressively got worse and was able to sit with head between legs. Took about 1 minute before I didn&#39;t feel like I was going to pass out. Shaky and weak after. Pulse 78 and oxygen level ok. Completed virtual visit and no further medical treatment advised unless symptoms got worse, but advised it was likely a vaccine reaction.  Shortly after a bad headache and body aches developed (expected side effects).

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On 1/6 at approximately 9am hour, I noticed joint pain in my fingers while typing, muscle soreness in my upper back, a headache, and a slightly sore throat. It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

The patient got the covid 19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 24Dec2020. The patient wanted guidance on receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The reporter considered event was non-serious. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and after that on 24Dec2020, she tested positive for COVID . She was supposed to be revaccinated on 07Jan2021. She would like to know if she should she get this or does she need to be revaccinated. There is no prescriber. She received it through her work. She received the first dose on 21Dec2020, and assumed she was positive when she got it. She just had cough and muscle aches and a headache. Her dad was hospitalized. Hers was not that serious. She had not completely recovered yet. Her smell had not come back yet and she was just tired still. She said the headache was prior to getting vaccine.

However, as the reporter claimed &#34;she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine&#34;, this may provide  an alternative explanation.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded.

As such per the guidance I remained in the waiting room for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I had a light rash on both forearms and near the injection site on my left upper arm. I felt fine otherwise. I went up to the nurse in the monitoring room and showed her the rash. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. At the time I was not. She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated. It proceeded to get worse and when I looked at my throat in the mirror it was very red and starting to be visibly swollen. I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in to the emergency room.

She said she did to morphine. Her bp was 119/74 with a pulse of 94. She said her nose was starting to get itchy, her ears and scalp were itchy, and her eyes were blurry. She had red blotches all over her neck and chest. She said her throat was tight. She was able to swallow the water she requested. I gave her 50mg of benadryl.  She had no visible signs of being unable to breathe. I explained to her we could call 911. She reported she had no insurance. She said she was on her lunch break at the hospital and wanted to get back. She did walk back across the street unassisted. Clinical observer, followed her over just to verify she made it in the building. She ended up checking herself into the ER instead of returning to her shift.

                                                Within 2 minutes post vaccination i started feeling loss of sense of myself. I could not pinpoint if i felt dizzy or vertiginous. Felt like i was off balance and i was super vernous to walk. Vertiginous episodes come and go with peaks for at least 10 times. The whole episode lasted 4 hours until i felt going back to myself.   I was provided water, 1 L and orange juice, there was epi available. No anaphylactic symptoms, no shortness of breath.   I drank 1,5 L of fluids and then my BP was checked 120/80, HR 80s.  I note that i never felt syncopal,  no diaphoresis, nausea, nor darkened vision and i was fully interactive with the bystanders.  Note, i am a critical care intensivist so i had full grasp of the issue but i could now quite describe the sensation of this acute loss of instability. The best way to describe this was vertigo. Similar episode occured at the first vaccine with COVID, occured after 10 minutes and lasted no more than 30 seconds. I didnt report that then because i thought it was just dehydration.

                                                stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast; stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast; coffee (which is what has been tasting weird), tasted so gross; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient herself). A 37-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL3302, Expiry date: unknown), at 37 years of age via an unspecified route of administration on Left arm on 01Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication included multivitamin (unspecified) and estradiol (ESTROGEN) as a supplement within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1685, Expiry date: unknown) on 07Jan2021 at 09:30 AM on left arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Exactly two weeks after the first vaccine I started smelling cigarette smoke and a sweet garlicky smell. Things tasted a little funny, but I mostly noticed it with coffee. Patient also had known allergies to clindamycin and Sulfa. The patient stated that, things tasted a little funny, but I mostly noticed it with coffee. I didn&#39;t think about the COVID shot, I just thought maybe I had a cold. Then exactly two weeks after the second, my coffee (which is what has been tasting weird), tasted so gross I had to throw it out in Feb2021. That&#39;s when I put it all together that it is probably from the vaccine. Then the more I research that sweet garlic is actually yeast I am smelling. Then I realized since all this has started by in Feb2021 stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast and sure enough I googled it and it looks similar. My co-worker is having a yeast infection also, but it is only in her mouth. The patient received treatment for the events with diflucan 150mg a 20-week cycle. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. The outcome of the events was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal relationship, the causality between the suspect &#39;BNT162B2&#39; and the reported &#39;stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast&#39; cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 15 minutes after the injection I felt a warm sensation throughout my body and it went away immediately. About 10  minutes after that, my throat started feeling scratchy/itchy/tingling, then my tongue and lips. After about 10 minutes it went away. I felt ok so I left the vaccination area and went back to my department I work in. For several hours the same symptoms came and went in waves, lessening over time. At 8:30pm the same day, I took 25 mg PO Benadryl to feel safe while sleeping. I felt fine the next day and reported it to the pharmacist in the vaccination clinic. I never felt like my airway was compromised.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

Every time she ate, she vomited and lost taste, lost the sense of taste. The patient was still nauseated (Hence, ongoing checked for nausea) and she hadn&#39;t tasted anything. She hadn&#39;t drink or ate anything yet this morning but last night her taste was starting to come back. But she still couldn&#39;t identify something. No treatment received. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the event nausea was not resolved, outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded.

She said she treated that with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL, 25mg LOT: P120108. EXP May2022, UPC: 193968051518) because her face started itching and her throat was getting dry, so she took BENADRYL 25mg this morning about 06:40AM.

She says she got to work and started working, and her face was starting too itch and be red, and her throat was super dry, this was at 07:20AM, so she took prednisone (NDC: 20603-5338-31, LOT 8675217, EXP Dec2020) 60mg by mouth.

The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

I discovered in the morning that i could not hear out of that ear.    My husband, a physician, examined ears and did not see any effusion.  Consulted with a friend who is an ENT specialist, and he recommend initiating high dose steroids immediately.  2 days later, had audiology test in ENT office, and it revealed severe Sensiorneural hearing loss in right ear.  The steroids were continued, and valtrex was added.  I had MRI of head on  1/7/20 which did not reveal any abnormality.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Hearing loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse Anesthetist (patient).  A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0140) on 18Dec2020 at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.Medical history included ongoing anaemia. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021 at 16:00 the patient experienced hearing loss, serious as medically significant. Patient had no problems with her ears before hand. On 06Jan2021 around 4 PM, she was just walking in the store, with no loud music or anything, and all of a sudden her hearing in her left ear went lost and muffled. On 07Jan2021 she went to the Otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) to get her ears checked. They said no it looked perfectly fine. They did an audiogram and hearing test on 07Jan2021 and there was a 20% hearing loss. She had no idea what it was from. She took no other medications. She had anemia but that was it. She was wondering if hearing loss has been reported with the vaccine either in the studies or recently. She researched it, and with the COVID virus itself, back in Jul2020 and Oct2020, people reported hearing loss. So she went and had a COVID test in Jan2021 and it was negative. Patient stated it was very scary and weird. Event treatment included high dose oral steroids to see if it can be treated and the ENT doctor was also giving her steroid shots in the ear. She was due to see him again in Jan2021. The outcome of the event Hearing loss was not recovered.  Patient also clarified that she did continue with her second dose of the vaccine on 08Jan2021. She had asked the ENT doctor his opinions on still getting the second dose, and he recommended it. The second dose of the vaccine was given on 08Jan2021 (lot EL3302, EXP: May2021) at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported hearing loss cannot be excluded.

                                                Ringing in ears; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Dec2020 16:00 (first dose, lot number: EJ1685, expire: unknown) at single dose, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 08Jan2021 09:00 (second dose, lot number: EL3246, expire: Apr2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included very frequent yeast infections that started about eight years ago, hypothyroidism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she has been on medication her whole life). Concomitant medication included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) at 90 mg daily for hyperthyroidism (she has been on this particular medication about a year, but she has been on thyroid medication her whole life). The patient experienced ringing in ears on an unspecified date. She got two doses of Pfizer vaccine. It may be a coincidence. She started having intermittent ringing in ears and now it had been constant for 3 or 4 days in a row. She had continuous ringing in her ear and has never had problems with her ears before. It wasn&#39;t going away. She was at the point to go to the doctor. She honestly didn&#39;t know the date. She noticed it intermittently about the time she got the COVID vaccine. She didn&#39;t really pay much attention. She got the second shot about the time it started constantly. She couldn&#39;t say 100%, maybe it was coincidental. Caller clarified that she noticed intermittent ringing in the ears about the same time of the first dose. She noticed constant ringing about the same time as the second dose. She would rate seriousness criteria at a five, in the middle. It is not requiring hospitalization, but she would seek medical treatment if it didn&#39;t go away. The outcome of event was not resolved. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events were not required a visit to emergency room nor physician office at this time, but she was considering seeing her doctor or an ENT. No AE following prior vaccinations. No relevant tests.

Day 1: Spoke to OB office nurse- offered steroids which I declined &amp; spoke to PCP recommended go to ED, which I declined, I&#39;m a family physician and had otherwise normal Cranial nerve testing and no other neurological changes- seems fully consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy.  Day 3 had co-worker physician use otoscope - normal exam bilaterally.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.
