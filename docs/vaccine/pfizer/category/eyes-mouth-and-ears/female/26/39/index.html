                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

I went to talk to the doctor and while I was conversing with her my tongue started to get tingly and started to swell. I took 50mg of benedryl and kept an eye on my symptoms and the tongue swelling started going down but the rash is still there.

                                                Received the Covid-19 vaccine. She reports symptoms of throat tightness externally and tingling tongue.  Patient denied sudden warm feeling, hives, itching, swollen lips/tongue, dyspnea, wheezing, dizziness, tachycardia, crampy, abdominal pain and vomiting.   I have observed only what was reported by the patient.   Treatment/intervention: patient was given water and a hard candy to suck on. After sucking on the hard candy she stated that helped with her symptoms.  Pt was monitored for 30 minutes and stated she felt better with no symptoms before leaving.  Informed what to do in case of a severe allergic reaction.   Pt was asked if she would like to go to the ED and pt denied.

                                                Probably 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I started noticing that my right side of my face was numb. Over time the numbness faded into tingly ness (like after getting a numbing shot at the dentist). It was only the right side of my face and focused around my corner of my mouth and along my jawbone. Over time the feeling subsided probably an hour. While being observed at the clinic they did not notice signs of Bells palsy( facial muscles were still responding symmetrically). Had not sign of allergic reaction at the injection site.

                                                After receiving the second dose of the covid 19 vaccine, as I was walking to the elevator, my vision started to become blurred and I began to see stars. I walked over to a nearby chair and as I sat down it felt as if my throat was closing. I began sweating profusely and my whole body was flushed. My heart rate was tachycardic and my blood pressure was hypertensive when checked in the ED. When I got to the ED, my vitals were obtained like I described but my heart rate had slowed down by time I got there. A nurse passing by explained that my heart was tachycardia when he assessed me in the chair. The ED did an EKG of my heart that determined my heart rate was normal sinus rhythm in the 70s. They observed me for roughly an hour and let me go home. My discharge papers explain I had a vagal response.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Uncontrollable chills, severe body aches, upper/middle back pain, neck pain/stiffness, extreme fatigue, ear aches, raging frontal and occipital headache, and hives (white in color on both legs - inner knee area), itchy neck and chest. Benadryl taken for hives. Ibuprofen taken for other side effects. No treatment/OTC medication provided real relief until late evening of day 3 after vaccine. Hives and side effects resolved entirely after 4-5 days post-vaccine. White hives turned into red healing rash-like bumps and eventually disappeared entirely.

I had high blood pressure 180/120, facial puffiness and mild bottom lip swelling. I developed an onset of increased mucus in my throat causing me to clear my throat frequently. RN on site reported no throat swelling, but increased thickness due to mucus. I received a Benadryl injection on site within 30 minutes and almost immediately symptoms began to lessen. The next day I had mild bottom lip swelling, body itchiness, chest rash, headache and fatigue. Today (24 hours after vaccine) I have a headache, fatigue and body itchiness.

Have gone to the ER, urgent care, and neurology. Have tried various medication with no luck - todarol, Advil, acetominophen, methylpresidone. Notably,  at the 6 week mark on 3/18/21 I received a semi quantitative antibody test specific to the spike protein which came back negative. I have previously reported to VAERS but symptoms have continued so I am filling out another form.

                                                Stayed 30 minutes after vaccine at vaccination clinic to be safe in case of a reaction. About 5 minutes after leaving 11:30 I could taste the vaccine in my mouth. I immediately felt intense sharp tingling in my lower lip, it felt hot and swollen (upper lip never had a reaction). I instantly felt a lump in my throat and had a hard time swallowing. I started with chest pain that resolved itself in a minute or two. A few minutes later a family member noticed my face was red and flushed and said I looked like I had a sun burn. Swelling in throat resolved within an hour. Lip never visually looked swollen but I could feel the tightness, burning and tingling that resolved within the hour. Redness on face resolved within a couple hours. Had tiny blisters about 3 show up above upper lip I still have them the next day with a couple more but they aren&#39;t causing problems. My airway was never blocked I never had a hard time breathing. I did have a sore throat this morning March 25 day after vaccine. All other symptoms seem normal.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction. I have an exercise bike at home, and tried to work out but had to stop after only half an hour of very low effort biking because I couldn&#39;t get a deep breathe. usually I can bike for an hour at high intensity no problem and have never had to stop because I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

                                                When I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID shot I had no issues. When I received the second dose I had the vaccine injected and then I got up and walked to the monitoring room where we sit for 15 minutes. Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

Patient was monitored by staff from thereafter.  At 11:52am a second dose of 25mg diphenhydramine was given to patient due to possibly lip swelling reported by nurse. Patient denied shortness of breath or chest pain.  By 12:12pm marked lip and face swelling reported by nurse monitoring patient. Again patient denied shortness of breath/wheeze/chest pain. However, we advised patient that lip/face swelling is considered anaphylaxis and because symptoms were  progressing and not mitigated by diphenhydramine epinephrine would be advised. Epinephrine 0.3mg via auto injector pen was administered to patient on left outer thigh and 911 was called.  EMS arrived at 12:22pm and took patient to  local emergency department.

                                                The night of my second covid 19 Pfizer shot, I began experiencing a strange sensation on the right side of my face near my mouth, cheek, under my eye and on my forehead. It started as a burning sensation and then turned into a dull tingling. It was consistent for 3 days and then began to become intermittent and I still have it today 1 week post vaccine. On day 4 it progressed to tinnitus right more than left ear. Day 4 evening to day 5 was all the above plus ear pain and fullness in my right ear and just pain in the left. I contacted my PCP at this point twice ( once about the initial face symptoms day 1 and to tell her about the ears day 6) and she prescribed me amoxicillin. That night I began having sinus pressure and pain, headache, and malaise. I followed up with an ENT this morning who said everything looked structurally well and could not find a reason for the tingling. She also covid tested me which was negative. Advised me to submit this form at this time due to ongoing symptoms. I will be following up with them within the next few days for further examination.

After some time sitting on the toilet I stood up to wash my hands and reach for a hair tie to put my hair up because I was sweating profusely. I felt my vision darkening again and fell to the ground. I never lost consciousness and laid on the ground for a few seconds. I felt my stomach begin to churn again so I got up and sat on the toilet and began having diarrhea again. I texted my sister to come upstairs and bring me a Tylenol and some peppermint oil for my stomach. I took 1000mg of Tylenol, rolled peppermint oil on my stomach and stayed sitting with a cold towel on my head. I was then able to stand up and go back to bed at around 3am (shortly after taking the Tylenol). The next morning I woke up at around 8:30am, still feeling fatigued and mild chills. The diarrea and nausea are gone.

I waited 20 minutes in observation and spoke to nurse and PA who assured me I should be fine if I had no history of anaphylactic shock. 20 minutes later I still felt tightness in my throat, metallic taste in mouth, headache, and now slight difficulty swallowing, at which time I used my Albuterol rescue inhaler. Tightening in throat resolved within an hour. Metallic taste and headache is still present &#43;2 hours after injection.

Then patient reports tingling and itchiness on lips and in an around her mouth. At this point the patient took benadyl (diphenhydramine) OTC 25mg tablets. Hives resolved post-benadyl within 60 minutes and continued itchiness on skin until next morning. All symptoms/hives/itchiness resolved by next morning.

Patient after 10 minutes advised the pharmacist that she was having a bit of difficulty breathing, short of breath, and her throat was feeling funny. Patient remained conscious, breathing, and alert during this period, while sitting down. Pharmacist called 911. Pharmacist proceeded to draw up Benadryl for injection. However, as dose was being drawn up, EMS arrived.  Within 5 minutes, EMS arrived to assist patient. EMS took patient to provide additional care. Patient was conscious, breathing, and alert as EMS took her for further care.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

My partner thought I was dying as it was much more intense and extreme then normal. I am still having increased seizures in both pain and severity daily. Typically my seizures last 20 minutes and are from 4-5 in discomfort in pain out of ten. Now they are around 7, even a week later. The first severe seizure was a 10 level pain and diabling.   I also got severe swelling in my arm of the site, extreme pain in the my arm lasting four days, and two large cold sores. Typically my cold sores small and last for two days. Mine are still active and gave me a fat lip. I also have extreme fatigue but could be caused by the increased seizures and pain of them.   I been unable to perform my normal duties and responsibilities, which my seizures typically do not interfere with.

                                                27 year old female comes in 3/27/21 at 4:15pm to get Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has no family doctor. On her VAR form she states no seizure or history of seizure but does have reaction to HPV vaccine where her throat swelled up and her MD had to give her oxygen year ago. I asked about any other reactions to any other vaccinations and she said no and was willing to get this vaccine.  I told her to wait 30 minutes after vaccination to make sure no reaction. At 4:25pm her sister and mom tell us that patient is feeling week and dizzy and ask for water, I go out and check and she is pale and is ready to faint. Mother asks for orange juice which she takes a sip. I ask her if she has any health conditions like diabetes, seizures and they say no, then patient has what looks like a petit mal (absence) seizure. While sitting in the chair her eyes flutter, roll back she tenses up and her body freezes for about 20-30 seconds. I tell staff to call 911 and her sister says she&#39;s having &#34;another&#34; seizure. We don&#39;t move her but make sure she doesn&#39;t fall, once the seizure passes we move her to the ground to lie down. She regains consciousness and is coherent but confused. I do not give EpiPen because I witnessed a seizure. The fire and ambulance arrive to assist her and then her family mentions she did have seizures years ago. After 20 minutes or around 4:50pm she feels better and does not want to go to the hospital and walks out assisted by fire/ambulance staff. The next day I call her and she says she feels better and just has a sore arm and will find new doctor check her out.

This 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 10Mar2021 10:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;one number on there is EN and then she does not know if it is a G or 6 and then 204&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

On 10Mar2021, patient had eye puffiness in her left eye. Patient asked if it is safe to take the second dose. Her eyelid got puffy which began 30 minutes after having the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and it is not ongoing but resolved completely after a few minutes. She did not require treatment for the eye puffiness and the puffiness was mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye. Patient stated that she does not know in terms of causality if the Pfizer COVID vaccine is related to the reported events and was worried because a week after she got the vaccine, she had other symptoms and was not sure if they are connected with the vaccine. She also reported that she does not think the eye puffiness itself is that serious but it is medically significant and the other symptoms she had were chest pain, chest heaviness, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are not ongoing anymore and began around Friday, 19Mar2021 and resolved after a couple of hours of when they began. For the chest pain, chest heaviness and abdominal pain, she just took an antacid Prilosec for treatment. She thought about going to the emergency room but also thought she was having an anxiety attack and was close to having to go to the emergency room that night. She did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office.

Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the contributory role of the suspect bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to reported events is possible.

                                                I hear ringing in my ears that won?t stop. Sometimes it gets dimmer if i sit up, but it?s really bad when I lay down and when I?ve been trying to go to sleep. It?s like a whirring sound, the kind you?d hear from a machine whirring (like when you stand next to an ice cream machine?) There?s also this, like, chugging noise in the background.

THE PATIENT ALSO RELAYED TO THE PHARMACIST THAT SHE DID NOT EAT ANYTHING SINCE THE MORNING AND ALL SHE HAD TO EAT IN THE MORNING WAS A BANANA. WE GAVE HER WATER AND MOVED HER TO A ROOM IN WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO REMOVE HER MASK AND BREATHE EASIER. SHE THEN REPORTED OF TINGLING IN HER UPPER LIP. SHE WAS GIVEN A SNACK TO ASSIST WITH SYMPTOMS OF POSSIBLY HYPOGLYCEMIA. WE MONITORED HER FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES CONTINUOUSLY CHECKING ON HER AND HER SYMPTOMS ALL STARTED IMPROVING AND RESIDING. AFTER 30 MINUTES OF CLOSE MONITORING THE PATIENT FELT WELL ENOUGH TO GO HOME.

                                                Woke with up chest, arm and jaw pain on 03/21/2021. Presented to the ED. Her initial EKG was negative for any acute changes but her troponin was elevated. Cardiology was consulted. Her echo was negative for cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. But after her troponin continued to rise she was taken to the cath lab to look for ischemia. Her cardiac angiography was negative for obstructive disease, and coronary arteries were completely normal. Had low magnesium and potassium- so started on oral supplementation. Discharged on 03/22/2021 with nitroglycerin (which was not helpful and made her feel worse/nauseated) and to follow up with outpatient cardiac MRI and cardiology. This imaging revealed significant myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis.   04/01/2021 Per Cardiology: -Given that the patient had covid 19 back in November 2019 I believe she may have had a low yield subacute myocardial infection at that time that was somehow exacerbated by her 1st covid vaccine. Therefore, after some consideration and careful discussion I am advising against the 2nd vaccine at this time.  -No physical exercise for 6 months given her current myocarditis and family hx of sudden cardiac death -May trial PRN NSAIDS for pain relief -Recommend birth control and no pregnancy until at least after her follow up cMRI  -Follow up in 6 months with cMRI prior

I started to sweat out of no where but I didn&#39;t have a fever, towards the end of the night I lost my taste for the next two days.  I still had chills and was sweaty, I believe the second day I had a sore throat.  My boss sent me to get a Covid test and that came back negative.

A 28-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID Vaccine and the day after, was exposed to the virus, got sick right away and tested positive for the virus. The patient stated that she got vaccinated around 4pm, 17Dec2020. She was exposed to the virus by the same coworker twice on 18Dec2020 and then the next week, she believed, on 22Dec2020, the coworker tested positive for COVID. Patient stated that her symptoms started 24Dec2020. She did not think she had a fever as she did not feel feverish. She had flu like symptoms from an unspecified date with muscle and body aches from 25Dec2020. She lost her sense of taste and smell from 25Dec2020. She had cold-like symptoms from an unspecified date with congestion nasal and sore throat from 25Dec2020, sinus pressure and headaches from 24Dec2020. She had general fatigue from 24Dec2020 for a while. Patient had not had another COVID test since the one she had 28Dec2020, when she tested positive for COVID. She became symptoms-free on 03Jan2021. Patient was asking should she still get the 2nd dose of the COVID Vaccine. She was also concerned about the reaction her body was going to have to the vaccine after being sick. The patient had recovered from Flu-like symptoms and Cold symptoms on an unspecified date, recovered from muscle and body aches on 29Dec2020, recovered from loss sense of taste and loss of smell on 31Dec2020, recovered from congestion nasal, sinus pressure and headache on 03Jan2021, recovered from Sore throat on 01Jan2021, recovered from general fatigue on 02Jan2021. And outcome of &#34;tested positive for COVID after receiving the COVID Vaccine&#34; was unknown.

                                                Developed a rash around my neck and swollen eyes (thought to be poison ivy) on 1/3/2021. Since that time, the rash has spread to my back, abdomen, chest, neck, ears. It appears to be urticaria and is extremely itchy. I completed a steroid taper early on and the rash is no loner affecting my face. I am taking daily antihistamines and using hydrocortisone cream for the itching. The rash continues to spread and is made worse with scratching.  I am unsure if this is related to the vaccine, but this has never happened before and I have no known allergies. I got the second vaccine on 1/8/2021 (at the time the rash was improving and I thought it to be poison ivy).

                                                I received the dose at 12:00pm Saturday and by midnight I was awoken with severe 9/10 pain to my left arm radiating up my left side of my kneck to my ear and down to the middle of my back. This follows Sunday morning with muscle aches, joint pain, headache and nausea. Continuous nausea occurs until vomiting starts sunday mid afternoon. This all continues until Tuesday morning when a Phenergan shot IM is able to be administered at urgent care where I return home and sleep for 24 hours. Tiredness and weakness continue until the morning of Saturday 16th where I wake up feeling &#34;normal&#34; in a sense.

She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

No medications, new body washes soups etc. no new laundry detergent. Thought it was random until my lip once again started swelling on  2/1 in the morning while brushing my teeth (nothing new about routine) it then once again started to swell at work on 2/4 once again no food or drink or change in anything, and lastly began again last night 2/5 while laying in bed. Each time has been different locations of the lips has not spread further and has be variant in symptom intensity. One case only lasting minutes and 2 lasting up to 24 hours. Might not be related to vaccine but I?ve never had any allergies before and this began after, so for the sake of research decided to report.

                                                Initial side effects were minimal/expected. After about 48 hours I started experiencing jaw pain in the left mandible extending up to the left temporomandibular joint. I have a relatively high pain tolerance so I wouldn&#39;t say the pain was severe or life-altering, but since the frameworks reported occurrences of reactogenicity at 3 or greater and I am taking OTC pain medication to manage my jaw pain, I figured it was a data point worth reporting. The pain is certainly tolerable, but makes opening my jaw fully or chewing on the left side unpleasant enough to make it worth taking painkillers.

                                                Pain began as a &#34;crick&#34; in the left side of the neck two days after receipt of second covid vaccine. It has now been three weeks and pain has been continuous in the left shoulder and left neck. Pain radiates down the arm and up into the ear, making the ear hurt and making it painful to swallow. The skin is also tender/painful to touch in the same areas, as if nerve damage has occurred. Swelling is visible in the upper back and neck.

When smiling one side trip the far far left the other side stay still. My job had me go to a doctors up where they diagnosed me with Bell?s palsy it and the doctor advised me to report this. My treatment plan is antiviral medication and steroids, Valacyclovir 1gm tid, methylprednisolone 4grams qid. I am very upset and heartbroken every time I look in the mirror I cry because I cannot recognize my face I did read online that Pfizer did have side effects of bells palsy but I never thought I would get it given my age and good medical history. I would love for someone to reach out to me I need to know what happens from here.   As a result I have been off of work for a couple days.

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Feb2021 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, migraines, asthma, hay fever, acid reflux, hives when exercising outdoors in the cold, and allergies: latex, cats, dustmites, gluten and dairy intolerance; all from unknown dates.

A few minutes after taking the vaccine, the patient experienced a tingling feeling in lips, which then spread to mouth, throat and tongue. The patient told a nurse and she said that she looked fine. The patient asked if lips were swollen but they weren&#39;t. Then a few minutes later she felt very lightheaded and had an elevated heart rate. Then around this time, she saw her tongue was swollen to about double the size. The nurse said she looked fine, and monitored her for 30 minutes then let her go. This swollen tongue lasted for about 2.5 - 3 hours. After the swelling subsided, tongue felt like it was numb/burnt by drinking a hot liquid. 12 hours later, she woke up in the middle of the night with an elevated heart rate and had trouble sleeping. The patient spoke to her doctor and it sounds like she had an allergic reaction, even though she have no history of allergies for any of the vaccine ingredients.

                                                Seeing black, spotty eyesight, almost passing out but was able to make it back to bed to lay down twice. Cannot stand or walk for longer than a couple of minutes unassisted (holding onto something) without breathing becoming shallow and dizziness setting in. Intermittent dizziness and inability to focus eyesight occurred throughout the day even if sitting down. Issues have been consistent throughout entire day. Not sure if this is adverse but also started having circulation issues in toes/fingers turning white &amp; numb when either standing, walking or lying down. Experienced chills but only until ceiling fan was turned off. Circulation slightly improved except in feet.

A 28-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left deltoid on 05Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8733) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had no health issues and was &#34;perfectly healthy.&#34; The patient didn&#39;t want to get the vaccine but her mother said she needed to get it, so the patient got the shot. On 09Apr2021, four days after receiving the vaccine, the patient had ringing in her ears, then it was hard to hear, and had pain out of nowhere. She started having ringing and pressure in her ears, then lost hearing in one year. She went to the doctor and had a hearing test. She had 50% hearing loss in her left ear. The doctor ordered an MRI with contrast and without contrast and came out negative. Patient&#39;s mother thought the patient had allergies, although the patient never has allergies, so the patient took some Afrin nose spray and saline spray. They waited. Then it was the other ear. Patient started having trouble hearing/ can&#39;t hear out of ear. The patient&#39;s ears got worse then the patient started losing her hearing. Today, the patient felt that something was not right so she went to see and Ear, Nose and Throat doctor diagnosed the patient with severe hearing loss. The doctor kept asking the patient when she received the COVID vaccine because he had seen this in other patients who have received the vaccine. The doctor believes that the hearing loss was because of the vaccine because it started right after the patient received the vaccine. The doctor prescribed the patient a high dose of cortisone for 12 days and now he wants an MRI of the patient&#39;s brain with and without contrast. There was not a question that loss of hearing is a side effect of the vaccine. The doctor had seen this before and mother just wanted to know if she has to spend thousands of dollars, what happens? Does she need to go to the news? She wants to know what to do. Is the hearing loss temporary? What percentage had the reaction recovered from it? The patient&#39;s insurance was going to run out at the end of April and she will not be able to afford the treatment of this. What is going on? The event was so bad that the patient said she will not live like this- its a ringing and pressure in the patient&#39;s head and its driving the patient crazy, now its gone but she can&#39;t hear. The doctor had seen this before and patient&#39;s mother just wanted to know if the patient has to spend thousands of dollars, what happens? Does the caller need to go to the news? The caller wants to know what to do. She stated &#34;I did my own research. Every time I googled hearing loss, it&#39;s everywhere about ringing in the ears. My daughter left her job and now we have medical bills and she has no insurance. Pfizer has not been very good with getting back to me. I need help for my daughter. I need financial help. They&#39;re thinking about killing themselves because of the noise in their head. This should really be out there to say that there&#39;s a good chance that you may lose your hearing and have sounds in your head that drive you crazy. People need to be educated to make the right decision for them.

Patient had a MRI of the brain with and without contrast and it was negative. She used steroids and was not better. Outcome of hearing loss was not recovered, of ringing and pressure in her ears recovered on an unspecified date, of remaining events was unknown. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

But at night I started wheezing, had sweats and chills, did not check my temperature but I had pretty severe chills that night. In the morning I checked no fever, but still chills, severe cough and sore throat.. Headache and fatigue.  All got worse more severe on Saturday and then I decided to go get tested for Covid on the Care Clinic. I had a known exposure to COVID before I got the vaccine around  01/04/21 - my husband who tested positive on the 6th) I tested positive. All symptoms continued (except the tingling on the mouth it stopped on the 8th) and I saw my OB-GYN on the 11th due to a low amniotic fluid - I had an ultrasound at the facility and was referred to MD and saw him on the 11th as well.  Now I lost my sense of taste and smell. The chills have subsided a little bit and so the headache, but fatigue, congestion and cough are still there. I had increased intermittent shortness of breathe but could be the baby&#39;s position.

                                                I received the COVID Vaccine yesterday (1/24/21) around 12:10pm. I experienced no effects while waiting the allotted 30 minutes. The next morning, January 25th 2021, I started to experience arm soreness and blurry vision. The blurry vision is worse in my left eye. My vision has not improved after waking up, taking a shower and putting saline drops in both eyes. The best way to describe the sensation is hazy, blurry and sometimes double vision.

A 29-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 14Jan2021 at 05:15, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and uses an inhaler, glaucoma, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which she takes no medication. When she was a baby she had a reaction to the pertussis vaccine, she thought it was just a rash. Concomitant medications included topiramate (TOPAMAX) and bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN). On 14Jan2021, the patient had a reaction after getting the vaccine. She reported that she had lip and tongue swelling. On the day of the report she still has the lip swelling. On 15Jan2021, the patient also had a raspy throat, red ears, a temperature, and headache. The center where she got the vaccine gave her diphenhydramine hcl (BENADRYL) through injection and the swelling went down. She noted she can breath, that has been complete fine. She explained that the lip and tongue swelling had gone completely down last night after the diphenhydramine hcl, but the lip swelling has come back as she has not taken any diphenhydramine hcl yet at the time of the report. She plans on taking some soon. The outcome of the event of tongue swelling was recovered on 14Jan2021 and outcome of other events was not recovered.

On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after receiving my vaccine I felt warmth down injected arm. Approximately 20 minutes post injection, I experienced a drop in my blood pressure, heaviness in my legs (like walking through cement), and ringing in my ears. At approximately 12:30-12:45pm I experienced mental fog (I couldn&#39;t remember how to turn off my windshield wipers), increased heart rate, rapid onset of feelings of panic, minor shortness of breath, neck/clavicle tightness on side of injection, and sweating. Between approximately 1:30pm and 2:30pm I continued to have extreme sweating, as well as: increased pulse, fatigue, dry throat, muscle weakness/shakiness, brain fog, and headache. At approximately 3:30 I hit my knee on the bed frame and felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and immediately had a severe drop in blood pressure that felt similar to a vasovagal event. I called the vaccine clinic and my symptoms were noted and I was told to seek help if my symptoms worsened or I felt like I was going to pass out. My symptoms have not worsened but I am still experiencing extreme sweating along with shivering, shakiness, blood pressure changes with movement (orthostatic hypotension), and fatigue - time is currently 5:50pm

It still hasn?t gone away I can?t feel my lip and my teeth hurt to chew anything and are sensitive to cold and hot and throbbing. I went to the dentist and they said it was fine.

I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

                                                Taste and smell became disgusting; on day 1 of symptoms (2/27) everything that I tasted was a range between stale and vomit-flavored. Bread and cheese were altered but &#39;okay&#39; until day 5 of symptoms. Currently on day 7 of symptom and cannot tolerate smell or taste of anything, including water. Every single food item, anything with scent (like soap), water, even the heat from the stove smells/tastes like vomit. Went to clinic on 3/5/21 and tested negative for COVID-19 (Previously tested positive on Dec 10, 2020 so ensuring had not contracted again) and full blood count came back normal. Expect follow up call on Monday for MRI/CT scan. I have a terrible headache but I imagine it is from lack of food and water since there was no sign of illness at doctor appointment. Doctor indicated he wants to see results of brain scan before saying for sure related to vaccine, but since I have absolutely no other symptoms, he was puzzled.

                                                Patient presented for her first covid vaccine today. She received the immunization in her right deltoid at 1703, was seated in the 15 minute observation area.  After about 10 minutes, she reported feeling dizzy.  RN alerted EMS who brought her for closer evaluation.  While in EMS care, patient developed rash and hives on her neck and arms, swelling in her lips and tongue, shortness of breath with oxygen saturations in the 80&#39;s.  EMS started a 20g Left antecubital IV, administered 50 mg benadryl IM, 125 mg solumedrol IV, placed patient on supplemental oxygen at 2L nasal canula.  After medication administration, patient&#39;s rash and hives began to resolve and she was able to speak clearly after medication.   Patient was transported to hospital via ambulance for further evaluation. VAERS documented.

It has almost 3 weeks now and my tongue still feels this way. I&#39;ve gone to the doctor for blood tests, mris and they said everything is normal and to try to contact the CDC about my tongue as it seems like it is a reaction to the vaccine. I am supposed to get my 2nd dose on Thursday 3/9/2021 and I&#39;m not sure if I should. I also want to know if this is a reaction that other people have had.

She was alert and oriented when I placed her in the sitting position on an exam table in the observation area. approximately 20 minutes later, she reported feeling itchiness in nose and lips. There was no swelling, redness noted. There was no rash, SOB, difficulty swallowing.  She has taken Benadryl for similar symptoms in the past and requested she be given some. She was given Benadryl 50mg PO. VSS through out. Symptoms resolved over next 20 minutes. She was asymptomatic at 1210 and was discharged with sister to drive home.

The left side of my face was not affected and there was no respiratory involvement. In the following few hours, my right eye had transient pain and my cheek felt swollen. The next day, I had chills, arm soreness, mild headache at times, and while my facial symptoms were still present, they had improved. The second day I only had mild numbness and tingling on my face with some lip tingling. Day three, four, and five I had slight numbness of the right side of my face and tingling lips, no further symptoms. As of day 6, I have slight eye pressure around my right eye and mild lip tingling.

I can still move my lips and eyes, but it just feels very weird and tight, and almost like I have to work hard to make them move.

                                                Everything started on January 24th at about 7pm exactly 20 days post first Pfizer vaccine. No other changes or vaccines given since October (flu vaccine) was scheduled for 1/25/21 for second Pfizer dose. It all started when I was working at ER when I started to feel cold like it was in an ice bath and numbness in both feet. I went to discharge my patients when I realized ascending numbness and coldness from the feet was traveling upward. Within 5 hours (around midnight) I went to hospital due to having severe weakness to where I couldn?t walk and loss of bladder control. I was rushed to MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I also had blood work done and a lumbar puncture. I was admitted for a couple days to watching the ascending weakness and loss of feeling. My MRIs came back clear from any diseases such as transverse myelitis, MS, etc. My LP showed mild elevated protein at 54 (normal range 15-45), one tube elevated lymphocytes 100% (range 40-80%) and one tube elevated monocytes 50% (range 15-45%). Also CK-MB w/reflex was 352 (range 26-140). I was discharged on 2/26 at 5:30pm with a diagnosis of bilateral leg weakness and numbness. From this point on I was wheelchair bound at home and being cared for 24/7. After discharge some additional random symptoms started such as chills with no fever to where I slept in sweat pants and sweat shirts, leg spasms/ twitches, leg heaviness, severe lower back and hip pain, a loss of sensation while going pee or poo but not incontinent, and things like drop foot with the severe weakness and numbness . On 2/3/22 I started with double vision, blurry vision and pain behind my right eye. I went to ER and had repeat MRIs of brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar with and without contrast and basic blood work and was sent home to follow up with Dr. on 2/9 and was discharged home. By 2/8 my strength started to get worse to where I couldn?t lift my kids. Finally saw Dr. neurology and MS specialist 2/9, he ran detailed neuro exams from head to toe, looked at both scans from both hospitals, all the blood work and LP results. He reported that I had severe hyper reflexes in both legs and Hoffman?s sign in both hands. My feet were completely numb and cold to where I couldn?t feel them or walk. Literally felt like everyday I was standing in a ice cold bath with no feeling of touch hot or cold sensation or pin pricks. He realized my loss of sensation was from my bra line down and included tingling in my hands and weakness in my arms. I was able to get up for the first time with a walker and take a few steps with assistance at this time. He then sent me to ER to be admitted and see their neuromuscular team to get further treatment. Upon arrival via wheelchair I was brought back to see the ER Doctor and re-did a neuro exam, some blood work and contacted the neurology team to come see me. I was then admitted to the hospital step down ICU under Dr with strict monitoring. On 2/10/21 The neuro team ordered another set of MRI of brain, cervical and thoracic with and without contrast due to a change in condition again since my last visit to hospital. They reviewed and compared studies with no changes. They scheduled me for MRI lumbar on 2/11/21 with and without contrast which came back no changes from previous MRI as well as another LP which everything that was off before was now normal. Everyday I would work with PT, OT and speech. I had no changes in speech and slowly got some strength back, and was able walk using a walker. I was then discharged home on 2/13 mid afternoon and was told I would do home health and follow up with their neurologist and Neuromusclar team once everything was resulted back. On 2/19/21 I saw my primary doctors office (nurse practitioner) where she checked up on the status of me, took me officially off work and on state disability, filled out paperwork for work and a handicapped pass. On 2/25/21 followed up with neurology, and discussed all my imaging and blood work. All CSF fluid came back normal, all labs were fine and wanted me to get an EMG to look for nerve damage. She also wanted a follow up with cardiology as my resting heart rate was 110-120 and would spike to 160s. On 3/1/21 Home health was started for physical therapy for strengthening and working on sensation for both legs. At this point I had almost full strength in my arms, still tingling in my hands and constant numbness and cold feeling in both feet and knees with severe sensitivity to cold, wind or touch on my legs. I had Home health twice a week every week for 2-3 weeks then started outpatient physical therapy which has been twice a week for 1.5 hours. On 3/5 I saw cardiology and was placed on a holt monitor for 48 hour monitoring. On 3/9 I had my EMG with Dr. and had a follow up with Dr. for 35 tubes of blood he had drawn for multiple diseases which both blood work and EMG came back negative. On 3/16 symptoms started to change from numbness to severe hypersensitivity to touch, severe shooting nerve pains, burning sensations, non stop tingling in hands, issues with temperatures either hot or cold, and swelling of both legs. On 3/17 I saw rheumatology that looked into everything said it was not lupus related as none of my inflammatory markers or lupus DNA strands were elevated and no lupus symptoms like rashes, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, hair loss or joint pain. He ordered more blood work and confirmed it was not a lupus flare up. He suggested doing a small nerve fiber biopsies. On 3/19/21 saw spinal orthopedics who reassured it has nothing to do with my spine, prescribed gabapentin for all the nerve pain and told me that neurology is who should be following me. On 3/26 I had an echocardiogram done due to the leg swelling and heart rates which came back negative for any heart problems and was told since the tachycardia is getting better to just continue watching it and was prescribed trazodone 25mg to help with sleep due to severe nerve pains, spasms and severe back and hip pains at night. On 4/1/21 was followed up again with neurology. Ordered small nerve fiber biopsy for may 18th, increased the gabapentin to 300 mg- 3 times a day and had me wean off cymbalta. I am still dealing with tingling, burning hot and cold sensitivities in both legs, still tingling in hands all day but strength is back to full. I am scheduled to hopefully return to work 5/30/2021 after being off since 1/24/2021.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I took the vaccine on Sunday and Monday morning my arm was sore and in the afternoon my arm was itching but not at the injection site, lower. then my eye started itching a little later. I got scared and went to the UC and they told me to take Benadryl.  It was just for a day after I took the Benadryl the next day all was back to normal.

                                                periorbital edema, lip swelling Narrative: ED note: This is a 29 year old employee who got her COVID vaccine yesterday. This morning she noticed facial puffiness, mostly around her eyes. No swelling of lips, toungue, no trouble swallowing or speaking, no swelling of throat, no SOB, no n/v or dizziness. Here she had some mild periorbital puffiness that I would not be aware of if she did not point it out to me. There is no swelling of her lips, airway and no SOB or problems with her voice. Her symptoms are improving in the ER. I think it is unlikely that this delayed symptom is related to the vaccine, however, she also states she had some swelling of the right side of her lip yesterday (none today), so I&#39;m going to prescribe her an epi-pen.

                                                About 12 hours of receiving my second dose I started to get really bad chills. Nothing could keep me warm and I had a fever of 102.  I had muscle aches  as if I just went through a rigorous workout. I had zero appetite but I?m not sure if that was due to side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. When I did finally eat something that evening I could barely taste it, I ate it but my taste buds were faintly picking up the flavors. Again I don?t know if it was because of the side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. The following day, Saturday 01/09/21 I only had chills which would come and go. I did not have fever and my appetite was back. Now today, 01/10/21 I feel my usual self.

On 1/9/2020 I began experiencing widespread bodily itch, no hives or swelling that included in and around my mouth. Took cirtirizine and symptoms were alleviated.

                                                Within seconds of vaccine administration, I felt flushing of my upper and lower extremities as well as muffling in my right ear. My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

                                                Neck stiffness/left jaw pain and stiffness within 1 hour of administion, lasting all day. Around 2100 the same night, rapidly progressing paresthesia of complete left face without obvious facial palsy yet (numbness happened over the course of about 30min to the point where I had no perception of touch in the left face).  At this point I took 60mg of prednisone and went to bed. When I woke up, the paresthesia/stiffness was less and progressively so since finishing a course of prednisone.   Concerned that this could have been a bells palsy reaction to the vaccine.

I tried to sleep under my usual schedule and routine. I kept waking up for no apparent reason. I felt like my body would rest but my brain never actually fell into sleep. I was not able to achieve REM sleep until around 7am. I woke up late around 11am feeling like I passed out from sleep deprivation. I woke feeling like I had a strange &#34;hang over&#34;. I felt dizzy and light headed. I had a general feeling of being unwell. I had a pressure in my head above my temples that circled my head to the back of my crown area.

                                                Started feeling poorly around 9:30 PM on 1/30. By 10 PM I had fever, chills, anxiety, dry mouth, headache, body aches, and I had a hard time staying asleep. I rarely wake during the night to pee but I woke 4 times for water and to use the bathroom.  I woke more than that, but 4 times specifically for that reason. My fever broke the next morning (1/31) around 6 or 7 AM. I still had a mild headache and felt tired and not like myself. I took ibuprofen and the headache subsided. Around 2 the headache came back as did the anxiety. I am not a typically anxious person. I took another dose of ibuprofen. Around 10 that evening (1/31) I felt back to normal.

The symptoms were severe from 7:30 pm on Monday, the day of the dose (vaccine received at 9:30AM), until 5:30 PM Tuesday (approximately 22 hours). The symptoms were relieved by taking extra strength tylenol every 4 hours. The symptoms were lessened, but still present until 9:30 AM on Wednesday.  I was still suffering from a minor headache all day Thursday. I also had soreness in the injection site, there was no swelling or redness that I noticed; the soreness was mostly gone by Thursday. I have had a left eyelid twitch in the past (randomly), it returned after the vaccine and was very bothersome. Today is Thursday and the eyelid twitch is still bothering me.

                                                Incredible arm/shoulder/lymph node pain starting 10 hours post-vaccination lasting about 60 hours. About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two &#34;attacks&#34;.  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of &#34;foggy&#34; 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these &#34;attacks&#34;, not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours. It is currently about 70 hours post-vaccination and most symptoms except moderate arm soreness are gone. During both attacks, BP and temperature were normal, heart rate slightly elevated (80-85 bpm).  Other non-severe effects included fatigue,  slight chills/flush.

My throat and jaw hurt as well. My neck is stiff and I can?t look to the left unless I turn my body. The back my head is also starting to hurt. My arm is sore where the shot was given but what hurts most is my neck, throat and head. I have body chills but no fever. I took Tylenol and called the dr on demand who told me to take Benedryl and if the symptoms got worse to go to the hospital.

I also felt like my hearing was less. Next day 2/13 I only felt ear fullness on my left ear. 2/15 I woke up feeling fine. A week later 2/19 I woke up with the injection site hurting along with my leg ear clogged again. Again I felt out of balanced and light headed. I went to see an audiologist on the third day 2/21 while my ear was still clogged. They didn&#39;t see any wax or ear infection. They did a hearing test which showed normal hearing but worse on the left ear than the right. They told me I should see an ENT. 2/22 I woke up feeling fine. 2/24 I was asymptomatic when I went to see the ENT and my hearing test was normal but when they did a videonystagmography it showed significant positional nystagmus.

A 30-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (Vaccine location: right arm) on 29Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included insomnia, anxiety, sebbhoreic dermatitis, and Covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included retinol, dandelion, melatonin, and unspecified multivitamin. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 29Jan2021 11:00 PM, the patient experienced dry mouth/excessive thirst (this is a side effect she has not yet seen listed). Every other symptom was pretty par for the course. No treatment received for the events. No Covid test post vaccination. The patient recovered from both events on an unspecified date.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Sudden lightheadedness, seeing stars; tunnel hearing, then tinnitus; leaned forward and lightheadedness continued to worsen, so I laid the car seat back; suddenly felt hot and started sweating profusely; slight nausea; bradycardia (which I never have - I am on a prescription stimulant, and usually run &gt;80 when seated). Called roommate to pick me up and take me back to the vaccine site to check with paramedics there before continuing home.

My arm was extremely sore for more than a week. I could barely fully extend my entire arm and I developed a lump in the pit of my arm pit. Both my tricep and  bicep mussels were tender. I also experienced headaches and tinnitus. The soreness of my arm and lump have gone away however I still have headaches and tinnitus to this day.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I had a flush reaction (felt like I had an IV and they had just flushed the IV). I felt dizzy. It went away quickly. 5 mins later I had diarrhea. I was also feeling post nasal drip, itchy throat, my chest had a burning sensation from the inject arm towards the middle of my chest. Throat was closing and tongue and lips were swelling. Entire body was itchy.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 22Mar2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (patient). A 30-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot EN6201) via intramuscular at left deltoid on 19Feb2021 at 14:30 (30-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar disorder, ADHD, depression, and low Vit D. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. There were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) from 2016 and ongoing for bipolar, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) from 2020 and ongoing for Bipolar, amfetamine/dexamfetamine (reported as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salt extended) from 2015 and ongoing for ADHD and depression, Vitamin D3 from 2020 and ongoing for low Vit D, and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12). The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Facility type was school or student health clinic; vaccine was administered at military facility. On 20Feb2021 at 21:00, patient had the normal headache, chills, &#34;hangover feeling&#34; in addition to an incredibly loud ringing in her left ear after her first dose. The ringing was intermittent throughout the day, lasting for several hours at some points. The intensity of it has subsided but there seems to be a constant dull ringing in her left ear now. She also had some weird effects with her medications the two days following her first dose. Not entirely sure if they&#39;re related but her medication seemed to be ineffective on Saturday and have little effect on Sunday. Severe tinnitus began around 10:00 (as reported) following her first vaccination, resulting in complete hearing loss in her left ear for about four hours. After that the severe ringing was intermittent for about five more hours. She now has ringing in both ears since, with noticed but undocumented hearing loss. There were no further complications after the second dose. The second dose (batch/lot number EN6205) was received via Intramuscular at left deltoid on 12Mar2021 at 14:00. The adverse events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit. The patient did not test COVID post vaccination. No therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of tinnitus was not recovered; outcome of other events was recovered with sequel.

A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Apr2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0150) as 1st dose, single, at the age of 30-years-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical/family history and concomitant medications. The patient went to go get her second shot of Pfizer covid vaccine but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her based on her reactions to the first dose. They said there was a chance of anaphylaxis reaction to the second shot. The patient reported blacking out, diarrhea, sweating and unable to talk. She consulted with her healthcare professional regarding whether to get the second shot and they didn&#39;t know. She asked if her reactions were normal. She doesn&#39;t know what to do whether to get a second shot given her reaction. It was mentioned that the patient was hard to hear at times. She got the vaccine on 06Apr2021 around noon and she was fine until around 3:30 am. She woke up in horrible pain from head to toe, she thought maybe she just needed to pee, she didn&#39;t know what was going on. She stood up and she blacked out like she was about to faint. She couldn&#39;t see anything, like it was completely black. She got to bathroom and she couldn&#39;t breathe at all, she couldn&#39;t talk. She thought she needs to go to the hospital, but she couldn&#39;t talk. Her face turned green, she had diarrhea, she was like dripping wet. At this point, she could sort of breathe. She felt like she was being held under water, still dripping sweat. She has recovered completely from these symptoms. The severity of symptoms was so severe she doesn&#39;t know if she had a fever at the same time, it was hard to tell. With the breathing part, she was so freaked out by that, so it&#39;s hard to know for sure, maybe yes. She may have had a low fever. She had a fever that night to the point where she was dripping on the floor. She has aching in her legs. She went to the doctor thinking she had Lyme disease, which she doesn&#39;t. Since that vaccine, she&#39;s had very, somewhat severe leg aches and extreme exhaustion like all the time. she can hardly go to work sometimes. Everybody has days they are tired, but this was different. She had to come home at 2pm and lay down for like five hours. She stated it was persisting. She had a blood test recently and everything came back perfect on 26Apr2021. She thought she had Lyme disease because of all the symptoms she was having, and it all came back negative. She didn&#39;t exactly get turned away. They said they didn&#39;t feel comfortable giving her the second dose of vaccine. The patient stated if a nurse tells her they don&#39;t feel comfortable, she wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable until she speaks to Pfizer. The nurse told her she had to go to an allergist and rheumatologist. The nurse said the same thing, the nurse told her that she should have gone to the hospital, but she wasn&#39;t thinking at that moment. She was just at a loss of what to do. That day at the hospital, they were scared with the second vaccine that she could go into anaphylaxis and she&#39;s not sure what to do. The patient had no other vaccines administered on the same date of Pfizer suspect and no other vaccinations within 4 weeks. The event hard to hear at times started on an unknown date while other events started on 07Apr2021 and ended the same day. The outcome of the events aching in her legs and exhaustion was not recovered, hard to hear at times was unknown while for other events was recovered. The events &#34;she blacked out, like she was about to faint&#34; was assessed as serious medically significant.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021.

Pt complained of a numb throat, and said, &#34;I cant seem to swallow my saliva well.&#34;   This writer did an immediate assessment of patient&#39;s throat with  flashlight, and no swelling, abnormal discharge, or discoloration noted.   Pulse-ox that was available on hand was used on pt, and sats were 96% and HR 78.    MA on site was asked to grab a complete VS machine for somewhere stat, for there was none on site.   This writer reassured pt was going to be okay and to breathe normally, for assessed pt was breathing fast.    This writer called every doctor listed on the &#34;Contact List for COVID Vaccine Clinic,&#34; but there was no response.   This writer then called Urgent Care and Minor Injury Clinic, but the doctors were busy with patients. Asked MAs from those areas to have a doctor call immediately for a patient here was symptomatic.   Once VS got here, VS were taken, and pt was assessed again.    Pt said there was no more numbness in her throat, but tongue was feeling itchy, and her body temp went from hot to cold.    Intitial VS: Temp: 98.3 BP: 122/80 HR: 77 O2: 99% RR: 18   Dr from Urgent Care finally called. Background story given, and she ordered Diphenhydramine Cap 25mg (Benadryl) which this writer had on hand in the emergency kit.   Order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Benadryl given at 1025.   Dr also suggested that ID doctor be called.    At 1030, I got a hold of Dr., gave her a background story, and she advised that the pt stay for another 30 mins to be observed and she would come see the pt.    Dr. arrived at 1100, assessed the patient, and ordered Cetrizine Tab 10mg (Zyrtec) to give to pt, which Dr. had to get from another department. There was no Zyrtec available in emergency kit.   Again, order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Zyrtec given at 1128. An additional Zrytec Tab 10mg was given at same time at 1128 &#34;for home use&#34; per Dr and per her order.    VS set #2 taken at 1133 Temp: 98.1 BP: 133/94 HR: 63 O2: 100% RR: 16   Dr suggested that she schedule an appt to see an allergist and to get an allergy test done prior to the next dose of the COVID vaccine.    Patient was feeling a lot better and more at ease.   Pt left comfortably with no symptoms at 1200.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

The roof of my mouth, and tongue became numb.  I needed to think really hard how to swallow.  It was like I could not figure out how to work that muscle.  I took benadryl, to ease symptoms.  It helped but did not take it away.  Next day, mouth and tongue still numb, and my ears, eyes, nose and throat were itchy.  My external skin was also itchy.  My doctor put me on a steroid pack. 4 days later, I am doing much better still not 100% percent myself, but very close to being back to normal. Still have slight sensation in tongue.

                                                Approximately 2am of 01/29/2021 I became very over heated for about one hour. Around 3am I then became incredibly cold and shaking. Around 4am I got out of bed and stood for a few moments, then walked slowly around my room making my way to our bathroom. I noticed my vision was not right, almost like a fisheye affect and I felt dizzy. I made it to our master bathroom and sat down on a chair for a few moments before I completely passed out. I fell forward, face first on to the bathroom floor hitting the left side of my head. When I regained my conscious I was weak and shaking and was unable to call out to my husband. I slowly pulled myself up to the toilet trying to make some noise and my husband then came to my aide.  As he talked I noticed his voice sounded much farther away than it really was. I also had a difficult time cognitively answering his questions about how I felt. I was pale, clammy, still shaking. This episode from the time I left my bed from the time my husband walked me back to the bed was about 45 minutes. My husband took my temp and I did not have a fever. The next five hours I alternated between feeling very cold and very hot.  I spent the next 24 hours feeling completely depleted. I rested as much as I could and had a greater than normal appetite.

                                                Received #2 dose of Pfizer Covid19 Vaccine on 1/08/21 at 10 AM. Approximately 12 hours later she woke up with right eye pruritus with sensitivity, maculopapular erythematous rash and itching over left cheek to temple. She was rubbing at her eyes and did develop local swelling around the right eye. She treated herself with benadryl and advil. Her swelling and eye sensitivity decreased later that day but she developed a fixed itchy maculopapular rash on btl forearms (pictures in chart). She works in the ED as a technician and was seen during her shift 36 hours post shot. Diagnosed with a possible delayed reaction to the vaccine and discharged with prednisone, allegra, hydroxyzine. Symptoms have resolved except for residual hyperpigmentation over areas on forearms where the rash was and still feels itchy, though this increased after stopping antihistamines for her visit.  She reports no episodes of lightheadedness/syncope, increased nasal congestion, difficulty breathing post vaccine. She has no history of anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to prior vaccines.

                                                Sore left arm with tenderness both series for 2 days . Two weeks after first vaccine, right-sided eachaches with mild headaches on right began. Prescribed ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution for a week. However, after this and my 2nd vaccine it progressively worsened with pain radiating to right jaw, more persistent and sharp right-sided headaches, blockage of hearing out of my right ear, hearing a pulsatile artery near my right ear mainly at night, and worsening earaches. Self-removed ear wax with an Asian ear pick, and the sharp headaches became intermittent mild headaches and earaches more mild. I was able to hear better but after a few hours my hearing was blocked again. I removed more wax again, but hearing was blocked again after a few hours, but this time, jaw pain went away. Went to see an ENT MD.  He removed more right earwax and prescribed me &#34;Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone 1%  Otic suspension&#34; for 10 days and sulfameth/trimethoprim 800/160MG TB (10 tablets) over 5 days.  After a few days, I was completely relieved of all my symptoms. He then prescribed me another ear solution for the yeast in my ears, which I haven&#39;t started yet.  Additionally, after my second vaccine, I had a cramp in my upper mid back for a day and weakness/fatigue for 2 days.

No issues were noted with tongue or throat swelling associated with anaphylaxis. Additionally I noted an odd taste in my mouth, potentially metallic. I also experienced some abdominal pain at that time that passed in approximately 10 minutes. Discomfort and swelling feeling of the lips has persisted for the past 2 hours. Still no difficulty breathing, raving heart or other signed of anaphylaxis. Lips are only slightly swollen on outside appearance if at all but the feeling of swelling is noticeable

                                                About two hours after receiving the vaccination, I had severe dull pain in my entire  leftarm which received the vaccination.  About 7 hours after the vaccination, I had extreme fatigue and slept for about 2 hours.  I then got up to go to my neighbor&#39;s house (please note, it was about 4 degrees, -6 wind chill, outside at the time).   When I got to the house, I stayed outside and smoked a cigarette for about 5 minutes.  Upon going inside, I got extremely light headed, fatigued,  my hearing went to &#34;white noise&#34; and a high pitched ringing, and my vision got blurry.  I then left the house with assistance to head back home.  While outside, despite the intense cold, I was dripping sweat in a matter of seconds.  I continued sweating and experiencing effects akin to what is felt prior to passing out, for about 7-10 minutes.   I then laid down and went to sleep.  Third day, still some soreness in the arm, but only at the injection site.  No more adverse experiences since.

                                                Light cough; Shortness of breath; Anaphylaxis; lost voice entirely; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 31-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Feb2021 at 13:15, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Patient did not have known allergies and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included piroxicam (PAXIL) and lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE). Patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient experienced light cough on 11Feb2021 at 14:45 with outcome of recovering, shortness of breath on 11Feb2021  with outcome of recovering, anaphylaxis on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, lost voice entirely on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. The events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. The patient was hospitalized due to the events in Feb2021 for 1 day. Events were considered life threatening. Clinical course: light cough after half an hour from vaccination. Within 2 to 3 hours had lost voice entirely and was suffering from shortness of breath. Her primary physician told her to go to the emergency room or he was calling an ambulance because he said it sounded like anaphylaxis and that her life was in danger. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with intravenous (IV) Decadron Pepcid and epinephrine. She received the 2nd dose on 21Feb2021 at 01:15 PM. Patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.   The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I started getting body aches and then I started getting severe pain in my lower jaw and upper teeth and side of my nose of my left side. It came on very comfortably. Rest of my body aches went away with Tylenol but this pain wasn&#39;t going away at all. I went  to my dentist. He said everything was normal. I went to Immediate care on Tuesday to see if I had a nerve issue. They diagnosed me with a facial nerve  pain - in the trigeminal nerve - the lower two branches - gave me steroids and Gabapentin. TMJ joint it would radiate to midline of mouth - when it wasn&#39;t the stabbing pain it felt like my mouth was being burned. It was a Medrol dose pack and took 6 days. By the next week the pain was completed gone.

Took pt into the vaccination room, took her blood pressure ( 125/82). There was no rash or hives. Pt was alert, oriented but complained that her throat still felt tight and there was a knot. Pt was asked to remove the mask so we could check for edema. Her lower lip appeared very swollen. We told her that it could be an allergic reaction and needed to administer the EpiPen and call 911- pt received 1 dose of epi pen 0.3mg into the left thigh through clothing at aroung 12:30 pm .We called 911 and continued to monitor patient while waiting for EMs to arrive. Her second BP was  122/75 after the EpiPen and she said the knot was still in her throat. EMS arrived very shortly after and took over. They told her that they would take her to a hospital to monitor her.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine on Sunday, I had significant fatigue and sensitivity to light with watery eyes and a headache and was in bed all day. The next morning on Monday I woke with a pressure headache that was kept at bay with Advil. The headache stayed the same on Tuesday and Wednesday. By Thursday the headache was so uncomfortable I was having trouble working. It stopped responding to Advil and the pressure continued to increase on both sides of my head with sharp, shooting pains throughout that would come and go with the constant pressure. By Friday, I couldn?t co to use work and ended up calling into my PCP and advising them that I had a migraine that was very different from my normal migraines that I get (pain on left side behind eye, very nauseous, sensitive to light, always responds to OTC meds) and it wouldn?t respond to Advil and asked them to call in something. They called in generic version of Imitrex that evening; but since this migraine was so different than my normal pattern, I went to the ER on Saturday. They did a CT scan to make sure there were no  brain bleeds and gave me IV magnesium and steroids. I declined the torodol and Benadryl. The headache was still there, but bearable finally when I left. It got worse again that evening and I ended up taking the imitrex at 3am and falling asleep, only to wake up at 7am with a skull splitting feeling. That feeling stayed for the next 4 days, slowly getting less intense. I was unable to workout any of these days (I workout for about an hour daily for the past 3 years) because it was extremely exacerbated by activity. I was not hungry. Finally on Thursday I felt more like my normal self but the headache remained slightly and now on Sunday all that is left is the sharp, shooting pains that come every so often and light sensitivity.

                                                Since the vaccine, I have experienced extreme paraesthesia throughout my left head  and face.  It is chronic and lasts from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed. I am also experiencing a watering, itchy left eye and tingling behind the eyeball. Extreme neuropathy in brain, it feels like electric shocks coursing through my head and crabs pinching at the brain tissue. I have also deal with temporarily facial paralysis on the left side of my face, though those symptoms have since abated. I am on Lyrica, prednisone, indomethacin, and xanax in an attempt to get some relief but there are very few doctors who seem to understand what is causing this debilitating adverse reaction.

                                                I had a mild headache for about 6 days. On day 7, I had a temporary vision cut for 43 min and then it returned in full, but I had a severe migraine and nausea. They did CT imaging and labs. Everything was clear. I was medicated with IV pain meds and anti-nausea meds. I continued to have a mild headache for a few days, but it eventually resolved.

A 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 04Apr2021 10:45 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypoglycaemia (she ate before the injection) and fainting. Concomitant medication(s) included Birth control and prednisolone acetate ophthalmic sus. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 5 minutes after the injection, the patient began having an odd taste in mouth, shortness of breath, and she fainted. She had a history of fainting, but it took longer for her to recover than usual (50 minutes instead of 15). When she regained consciousness a few minutes after, she had a headache, felt overheated, and could quite literally only see stars. Her breathing took 40 minutes to return to normal, and her body temperature took 2 hours to feel normal. She assumed this was mostly a vasovagal syncope response, but she wasn&#39;t anxious or in pain beforehand. After 6 hours, she still have the odd taste, a headache, and the expected sore injection site. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Paramedic took vitals and monitored for an hour. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I received the first Pfizer vaccine on 3/16/21 in the afternoon. I am a young, healthy woman with no pre-existing health conditions: I don&#39;t smoke, am under 120 lbs., no allergies, etc. Two days after the vaccine, I started to experience an eye twitch, which progressed into Bells Palsy by the following week: by 3/23/2021.   I went to an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed as such, and they contributed to the vaccine and told me not to get the second shot. They also advised I get a CT scan to rule out a stroke, which I did,  on 3/24/21. I expect that they also reported this. I have facial paralysis on the left side of my face, and developed an ear infection a week after this...I don&#39;t have allergy issues, and have not had an ear infection since I was a small child. This has been traumatic, uncomfortable and very scary because I thought I was having a stroke.

I decided to go to the ER to get a covid test because I was scheduled to work that day and I did want to make sure I was not positive due to the loss of taste but if I was not working that day I would not have got medical care. I did have loss of taste for some more days but after that it was resolved (around 3 days).

At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

Notified nurse that gave me vaccine, several other nurses came over and helped me into recliner and laid me back and took vitals. Vitals are stable. I quickly began to feel better (within 5 minutes of being reclined). Still had the numbness and tingling. I laid in recliner for 30 minutes, then sat up for 10 minutes before leaving. I drank water and ate 2 rice krispies while in recliner. Numbness and tingling improved, but lingered throughout the day and was gone next morning.

                                                At approximately 5 minutes into the 15-minute monitoring window, I became severely dizzy, flush, and light-headed while simultaneously experiencing right-sided tingling, the altered sensation from my forehead to collarbone (right side only). At approximately four hours post-vaccination my right eye had mild blurriness to my vision. The vision resolved within a few hours but the altered right-sided sensations continued for 6 days, gradually improving.  The lightheadedness and dizziness that required cool clothes and elevated feet resolved enough to stand after 30 minutes.

She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

                                                I received the first dose of vaccine on 12/17/20 with no symptoms initially other than soreness at injection site.  4-5 days post vaccine I began to have mild sinus drainage, headaches,  and backaches that I attributed to allergies, stress, and sinus issues.  On the evening of 12/23/20, I had lost my sense of smell completely and had diminished taste.  I was tested for COVID-19 around 0830 the next morning on 12/24/20 and was positive for the virus.  That day and the 7-8 days that followed I was extremely fatigued with muscle aches.  I continued to participate in the V-safe surveys and made note that I was having these symptoms likely because I was positive for COVID-19 (as of 12/24/20).  The CDC called and I relayed this information to them and it was decided that a report was not necessary.  After my second dose of vaccine on 01/07/21, I received another call from the CDC and it was recommended that I do file a report so data could be collected on those who have tested positive for COVID-19 after the initial vaccine.  I had no significant symptoms after my second vaccine and have presumably fully recovered from the virus to date.

She really didn?t think anything of it and did not report it to anyone or take any medication for it.  On 1/12/2021 she received the 2nd dose.  On day 7 of her vaccine she developed hives on her lower extremities. She took Benadryl that day and they improved, but did not got away.  On day 8 the hives reapproved and she took a dose of Claritin and that got her through working.  On day 9 (yesterday) the hives have migrated from just her lower extremities to her arms and shoulders.  She took both Zyrtec and Benadryl yesterday, but she is not getting any relief.

                                                I had the first vaccine with no adverse side effects and had no adverse side effects right after the second dose but approximately 2 or 3 days after I had facial swelling about my eye lids. Then, the evening of 1/20, I developed hives all over both legs. They were still there the next morning and I took Benadryl and later loratadine and they eventually went down. Later in the evening on 1/21 they came back so I took a Zyrtec and the next morning they were worse and were on my legs and arms and shoulders. I called employee health and the doctor directed me to take Zyrtec twice daily and also to take a Pepcid daily. At this point in the afternoon on 1/22, I still have the hives but they seem to be slightly improving as the day goes on.

My left hand still tingled but I lost feeling in my ring and pinky finger on the same hand. All symptoms resolved on their own by 3 hours post vaccine without the need for medical intervention.

                                                Patient came in for COVID vaccine she was in good spirits. After her vaccine, she started off with a small cough that started to increase. She started to cough more at which time I requested my RN to come and evaluate her and Monitor her while I reached out to our ER which is attached. We moved the patient to the sleep lab while waiting for the ER to come up. Patient started complaining she felt that her throat was closing. Her O2 was stable at 98/99. Her HR was over 100 bpm. When the ER team came up and put her in a wheel chair her upper lip was swelling and her arm was blotchy.   Patient did come up a few hours later to schedule her 2nd dose vaccine after she received a high dose IV Benadryl and Pepcid. She is going to speak to her PCP about this reaction and let me us know if she can take the 2nd dose.

After around 5 days, I thought it was stress related, but I started to have itchiness on the roof of my mouth at the back. There is a kind of rashy area in the back of my mouth, mostly on the roof. It itches a lot and it makes my throat hurt when I attempt to scratch it. I have had to use chloraseptic spray and numbing cough drops to ease the itch and pain. Also, I have been experiencing shortness of breath. I attributed it to Chronic Bronchitis, but it feels different and is not constant. I didn&#39;t make the connection of mild allergic reaction until I received my second dose. I received my second dose on 01/29/2021. I was experiencing flu-like symptoms on 1/30, and am not experiencing the same symptoms as of 1/31. I am, however, still experiencing the mouth rash and itching, and mild shortness of breath.

The left side if where I received my injection.  The numbness and tingling resolved after the first day to my arm and leg, but has continues around the left side if my upper lip. The sensation is only intermittent and can last a few hours. No treatments have been tried.

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine, I noticed a strong metallic taste in my mouth. The metallic taste lasted for approximately 5 days, decreasing in strength over time. Within 10-15 minutes of getting the vaccine, parts of my face went partially numb (primarily under my lips and along my right cheek). The numbness was largely improved after 1.5 weeks, but I continue to experience it intermittently 3&#43; weeks later. I also had severe jaw pain that lasted for about 2 weeks, on and off. Within about an hour of receiving the vaccine, I noticed a small amount of rectal bleeding as well; this resolved within the same day. Beyond that, my symptoms were &#34;normal&#34; -- pain at the injection site, mild nausea and chills on the day of the vaccine. I spoke with 5 different doctors about the facial numbness, and none of them were able to advise me on why that might have happened. My primary care physician recommended against getting the second shot until we have more information about what would cause these side effects.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

I went to use my bathroom, and began to feel week. I was still very lightheaded, and weak. I felt as though I was going to faint. My ears started to feel really warm, and I then vomited. I started feeling lightheaded and weak once again, and then suddenly had diarrhea. I was so dizzy, but managed to head to my bed to sleep. Every single day since, I have been dizzy and losing my balance. I wake up, walk around, and sleep dizzy. Then on Friday, March 5th, 2021 I developed a large lump directly under my armpit. I could not take the dizziness any longer and I went to the ER on Monday, March 8th. I was then diagnosed with vertigo and told that I most likely had lymphodenopathy.  Till this day, I am still having dizziness and will be seeing an ENT doctor. I also still have the lump under my armpit. My next dose is, March 19th, 2021.

                                                The day after the second dose I felt sweaty hot and nauseous. I was still really sleepy on the third day. My eye started hurting and I could hear a buzzing sound in both ears. It got worse and worse by day six and I was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. It was really painful underneath my eye on the inside corner with swelling on the top lid. The Steroids seemed to help the problem with my eye. The doctor suspected Bells Palsy. On week two I was prescribed steroids from Lymphadenopathy. I still have the ringing in my ears which is increasing after it had subsided for a little time. I also felt pressure in my ears which is very uncomfortable. Whenever I stop taking the Steroids the ringing in my ears returns like Tinnitus. I plan to reach out to a doctor again because the ringing in my ears has returned after it had improved but was still present after 10 weeks. I did not have any of the same symptoms after the same dose. I have seen a lot of professionals.

                                                Patient was wheeled in on a rolling chair(no wheelchair available at time) from nurse that administered vaccine because of anxiety and a needle phobia that put the patient into a kind of shocked state. Patient was sweating profusely, white to the face, and not speaking very much but would answer questions correctly. EMT was speaking with the PT before walking away to continue other monitor duties when he turned back to see patient limp in chair, head back, eyes rolled back, and some twitching movements of the body. EMT called for rapid response  because first thought of seizure and seizure like activity with the twitching movements. EMT got to patient, supported head up straight, and opened jaw to ensure airway was clear. Patient had no response to EMT trying to communicate. Sternum rub was performed where patient came back conscious nearly instantly. PT was unresponsive for roughly 10-15 seconds. Patient was told of what happened and vitals were taken on her, response team was cancelled with most them already on scene. PT was feeling better, sweating stopped, color to the face returned, and PT was speaking and understanding more clearly than before. PT was given a snack and water and was monitored by EMT for an additional 15mins before patient and staff were confident with her leaving.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

                                                Within the first 12 hours I developed a fever of 102 - 103 degrees farenheit and chills with headache and substantial fatigue. The chills went away after the first day. The 2nd day I still had a fever. Day 3 I had significant nausea in conjunction with headache. These symptoms have continued from days 4 - today, day 11 post vaccine. While they are improving, after the initial fever/ chills my symptoms translated to into seemingly hormonal with nausea, strong food aversions, headaches (that felt hormonal) and 4&#43; days with substantial constipation and fatigue. It has mirrored the sickness I experienced with both pregnancies however I am not pregnant. I am still experiencing a mixture of fatigue,  headaches, nausea and food aversions (food still does not taste normal).

                                                With in 10 mins of receiving  1st dose, I started to feel hot and light headed, my body became very hot, I started to sweat and then my throat started to dry up and close. I notified the provider on watch that was monitoring me during my 15 mins after injection and as the walked me to the room I became more and more dizzy, my throat continued to swell and close, my mask was removed where my face was covered with a rash and hives . The dr. Gave me 50 mg benedryl, and a shot of epinephrine.  After wards 911 was called, my heart rate was eventually brought down with the epinephrine as my symptoms began to be controlled. An inhaler was administered because I was short of breath. 3 hours later I was stabilized. I then was recommended to go to urgent care rather the emergency room since the wait was 13 hours to be monitored at the local hospital MLK. I went to urgent care near my home at Hoag hospital and they monitored me and gave me a steroid injection IM. I was discharged with an epi pen just in case abs to take benedryl every 6 hours . The following morning 1/8/21, at 8 am the swelling of my throat retuned I became light headed abs my tongue became numb. I was taken to fountain valley hospital where an IV was started, 500 mg of iv benedryl, another epinephrine injection was given abs I remained under surveillance for another 6 hours. They stated that a lot of people are coming with reoccurring episodes of anaphylaxis after the phizer injection.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

                                                Arm soreness at vaccine site that night; moderate pain. Was exposed to COVID 20 hours after 1st vaccine. Developed symptoms of COVID that Monday - five days after vaccine. Tested COVID positive that same day. Started with headache, then I had a fever over 101. Chills - bad chills. Lost my taste and smell a couple days after that and that lasted a long  time (about three days to get smell back and 10 days for taste). Just took Tylenol for the fever and headache. Also got leg pain - muscle type aches - painful - started on the 29th of December. Leg pain lingered and the pain went away by about the 7th of January. Took Tylenol as needed for that pain.

                                                It started out as general body aches. Then twelve hours post vaccine I got a fever of 103.4. My fever was consistent for almost 36 hours. After it broke I would be fine and then have hot flashes and then become cold.  I had a horrible pain between my shoulder blades that radiated into my left chest. I had a headache that lasted for 4 days. No matter the pain reliever used nothing touched the pain. My head hurt so bad it made me nauseous and dizzy. I had excruciating left sided jaw pain. It hurt to open my mouth. It shot up through my jaw into my teeth. I was unable to chew anything on that side due to pain, but I ate very little.

I was laid down and administered water until I felt better.  I went back to my worksite while having to use the hand rails because my vision was blurred and I finally made it to my desk.  I was then transported to the ER and my BS was taken which was 85.  I was given IV fluids, a chest xray was performed, a UA and pregnancy test was done, EKG and a CBC done which all was negative and normal.  From my knees down felt shaky the remainder of the week.

                                                Sudden never hearing loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 20Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

It was reported that the event resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Disability or permanent damage. The patient received an oral steroid as treatment. The outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and in absence of strong confounding factors, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of sudden never hearing loss cannot be excluded.

The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

After approx. 30 minutes of receiving my shot my left side of my face felt numb including the left side of my tounge as well as muscle pain and soreness on the left side on the back of my neck. Today is 3/5/2021, my face is slowly becoming less numb over time and rest. I also experienced fatigue and injection site soreness. I am particularly concerned about my face becoming numb shortly after receiving my vaccine and I am wondering if I should get a second dose when I need to?

                                                Pain and swelling of the right eyelid. Started about 48 hours after the first dose was administered and had been getting progressively worse over the next 48 hours. Talked to my PCP and a nurse over the phone and through one chart. Treating the symptoms as a stye seem to be helping. Ibuprofen, eye drops, and a product called stye have been helping reduce the symptoms, especially the pain. A hot, wet washcloth is even more helpful. Used it for almost an hour this evening and the swelling is way down.   My eyes themselves are actually starting to itch and look red tonight. This is the first time this has happened lately. I have seasonal allergies, but this whole thing experience has felt entirely different from that kind of swelling.   I&#39;ve never had swelling of this nature before. Or any adverse reactions to vaccines (aside from minimal soreness near the injection site).

I began experiencing brain fog and memory loss. Then i began experiencing vertigo that impaired my spacial reasoning. On Tuesday 3/9 I lost the ability to see objects far away. on 3/10 I woke up and was unable to read close up, or distinguish letters. The vision and vertigo has continued. I have to shut my eyes completely to walk without becoming sick. I can not be in a busy room with movement or my eyes will hurt. I can not read anything with font smaller then size 18. I can not watch TV because i can no longer see far away. I can not drive a car due to the motion., and i cant see the objects as they move.

My cheeks and lips were swelled up. My tongue was starting to swell but I could still breathe. I was wheezing so I took a Benadryl and then took another four hours later. I felt very light headed for the rest of the day. The light headedness and dizziness stayed for a few days with a headache. I did not have second dose on the recommendation of my doctor. I ended up contracted Covid-19 three weeks after the vaccine.

I told the nurse I didn&#39;t feel well and wanted to wait a little longer. Within 10 minutes or so, I started to experience tingling sensation all over my face and then it spread to my neck and then to the rest of my body. My face started to feel stiff and I became really hot. My tongue felt swollen and my entire jaw felt very stiff. I lost my ability to speak and then eventually had full body paralysis. I could not move any limb. I could hear and see, but I could not verbalize a response or move any part of my body. I remained in this state for about 1.5 hour. Afterwards, I regained my motor skills and my speech.

                                                After receiving the first vaccine, started experiencing a little neck pain and swelling on and off for 2 month since first vaccination on December 30th. After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

                                                I ultimately suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and was hospitalized for 5 days due to brain and spine inflammation.  I had numbness in my feet 2 days after my vaccine, then suffered from dizziness and nausea 3 days after my vaccine, and had face paralysis 4 days after my vaccine. I went to the ER 4 days after the vaccine and was told I have Bell&#39;s Palsy and Vertigo. I was prescribed oral steroids and anti-nausea medicine. In the following weeks, I had more tingleness/numbness of the legs, brain fog and confusion, blurred vision, unsteady gait, loss of balance, blurred vision and leg muscle weakness, increased anxiety, hearing sensitivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, 6th cranial nerve palsy, tingles in the face, and headaches. I finally got an MRI and when doctor?s saw the MRI results 3 days later, I was told to go to the ER immediately because I had brain and spine inflammation that needed treatment, and was diagnosed with ADEM. I then spent 5 days in the hospital to receive intravenous steroids and monitoring. During this stay, I had more MRIs and a lumbar puncture.

She took a nap and woke up an hour later with 101.2 (degree) fever (14Mar2021) and fought that, along with migraine, aches, chills, hot sweats (14Mar2021). About 8 hours after initial fever (14Mar2021), it spiked to 102.4 (degree) for two hours. It came down quick. The next day, 15Mar2021, it felt like the back of her skull was fractured. And since then (unspecified date), the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore especially when laying down. She has been sleeping on heating pad for 10 days now, and it got a little better but still super sore (head). The events involved a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.

Around 8pm I look in the mirror and I notice my face looked a little puffy, and tiny bumps around my nose and mouth.  The next morning, around 5am, my eyelids and lips were noticeable swollen and the hives (tiny bumps) were covering my face, it was itchy mostly around my nose and mouth. I took Zyrtec every day for three days. The swelling went down after the second day, the hives (tiny bumps) cleared up around day three, my skin  was completely normal after about a week. On April 13, I started to feel fatigued ( same way I did after I got the vaccine on the 3rd),  the next morning my eyelid and lips were swollen and hives and itchness returned. I contacted doctor and he suggested taking Allegra 24 during the day and Benadryl at night ) if I?m itchy. He almost prescribed prednisone for 3 days,but only take  if my face was still swelling the next day.  On the 14th, my face was still swelling so I started the prednisone. It took about 4 days for my face to clear up completely

                                                About 7 hours after my vaccine, I started experiencing chills and body aches. 9 hours after the vaccine, I felt as if I?d taken cold medicine. I was slow to react, felt ?foggy?, I had trouble recalling words and the names of household objects I was staring at, my movements weren?t coordinated and I dropped a few things. During the night, I was tired but had trouble sleeping. The body aches worsened and really concentrated in my joints, especially my spine. I stayed either in bed or on the couch the whole day following my vaccine but my heart rate (as read by my smart watch) would go from the 70?s to as high as 129 just from sitting up higher in bed. My normal resting heart rate is in the upper 50?s/lower 60?s and I don?t see 120&#43; unless I?m working out for at least 20 minutes. I didn?t take Tylenol or Motrin until 7 PM on April 19th (I took 800mg of Motrin) about 34 hours after my vaccine. I had a low grade fever and my head ached so bad all my teeth were throbbing before I took the  Motrin. I started to feel better within a hour of taking Motrin and was fine from then on. I only took Motrin the one time.

Then continued to have lower-grade vertigo (occasional major dizzy spells) and vision problems for about three weeks afterwards. Was seen by eye doctor and eyes looked normal. Got second dose, and it seemed to improve for a couple days then came back. After a few weeks of continued vertigo and vision problems (mostly depth perception and suddenly became extremely aware of pre-existing eye floaters because of the disorientation) went to an ENT and they were not able to find anything visibly wrong related to vaccine. Went on Ativan and symptoms have improved somewhat on it, but am very scared of them coming back when i go off of it. Seems to be improving very very slowly. This has been almost 2 months of symptoms now. Made it very hard to work or drive.

                                                Since the vaccine I have been having right sided hearing loss. Two days after my first dose I felt like I was underwater when talking to people, as their speech was distorted. I also felt pressure in my ear, as if it was filled with fluid, and was unable to &#34;pop&#34; my ears. I was evaluated by an ENT and there was no infection or fluid in my ear. It started to get better a little.  After my second dose, the symptoms worsen. My hearing loss was back worse than the original time and this time I had tinnitus constantly.

This 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 15:15 at single dose on left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to hepatitis B vaccine rhbsag (HEY B VACCINE) booster and poison ivy. Concomitant medication included biotin / calcium pantothenate / cyanocobalamin / folic acid / nicotinamide / pyridoxine hydrochloride / riboflavin / thiamine mononitrate (B COMPLEX), fexofenadine, ascorbic acid (VIT C) and Multivitamin. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Immediately after shot (29Dec2020 15:15), her tongue and lips tingled but it went away quickly. She was walking for a short distance and felt &#34;off.&#34; The patient checked her pulse and pulse ox and her heart rate (HR) was 180. Her HR had bounced around from 150-180 with minimal exertion and was in the 90s at rest. No treatment received for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The outcome of not recovered. The events were non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

                                                At around 11:45pm tingling started in my left eyebrow. I thought there was something in my eyebrow and after time of wiping it a few times I went to look into the mirror and realized that nothing was there. about and hour later I got a drink and a snack to eat and I realized I had a numb sensation in the left corner of my lip.  As a nurse I went though the signs of a stroke with 2 other nurses I called. Everything was normal other than that sensation. Thinking I was just overly tired I went to bed. When I woke up the next day I felt okay until I went to drink some coffee and the numb sensation in my corner lip was still there. Now I was concerned and called employee health and was instructed to go to the ER to role out a stoke. I followed employee health&#39;s instructions and went to the ER. I was diagnosed with facial paresthesia and discharged with instructions to come back if symptoms got worse.  Symptoms persisted all day and around 7 I called my mom on video chat to show a visual facial twitch on the left side of my face. right after I got off the phone with her the left side of my face drooped and my fiance immediately drove me to the closest ER. I was seen immediately and they decided to admit me. The did labs and head CT. They admitted me to labor and delivery because there were no other rooms. The next day I was seen by a neurologist and many doctors.

Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it.

Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

Dizziness went away 40 minutes later. 24 hours after dose had body aches. 2 days after dose I had blurred vision in Rt eye and then noticed that Rt eye was fully dilated and Lt eye was normal. Rt eye not responding to light. Went to ED and had 2 CT scans that were normal. They sent me where I had a third CT scan which was normal. I saw ophthalmology and my optic nerve was normal and eyes looked good, but Rt eye still didn&#39;t react to light. they ruled out pharmacological and said that it is something neurological. They still don&#39;t know exactly what is going on. While at the hospital, I started having urinary retention and now have a foley placed. I have follow ups with neurology, urology and ophthalmology and have orders for MRI of brain and neck.

This 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 at 08:00AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was received on 16Dec2020 at 7:40 AM at single dose. Vaccine location was in the left arm. The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 34-years-old. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ongoing fluticasone proprionate (FLONASE) for seasonal allergy taking for two years. On 17Dec2020, COVID-19 PCR test was negative.  On 04Jan2021 at night, she experienced myalgia, fever, chills, back pain and started with a constant ringing in her right ear and the hearing loss that worsened from before (started on 18Dec2020 after first dose, see AER # 2021012126). Start date of constant ringing in right ear was 05Jan2021. The events resulted in Physician Office visit. Hearing loss in right ear worsened and constant ringing in right ear were reported serious as medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious. She went to see an ENT doctor and get a hearing test. The hearing test showed moderate hearing loss and speech clarity of 96% in her left ear compared to 52% in the right ear. They don&#39;t know if it is permanent. She is currently being treated with 80mg of Prednisone daily by mouth and getting dexamethasone injections to her middle eardrum. All of these effects have resolved except the hearing loss and ringing in her ear.   All the events were considered related to the vaccine per reporter.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Almost immediately, I felt a pain go down to my wrist and across my chest. We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

A 34-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3284), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety since she was 13 years old. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the vaccine on Monday at 12 o&#39;clock. She got it for work. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She developed the side effect Tuesday at 2 am. The left side of her face started tingling and had numbness, which is the same side she received the vaccine on. She doesn&#39;t have weakness. It is not resolving. It is from her lower eyelid to her bottom jaw bone. When asked if it was improving persisting or worsening, she said it depends. Sometimes it gets worse and affects her lips, and sometimes it is on and off. It won&#39;t be completely gone. It switched between her cheek and jaw and then her nose and mouth sometimes. If she bends over, it tingles worse. It is just very annoying. It felt like if she had Novocain on the top and bottom of her mouth. It is irritating. She got it because she doesn&#39;t want COVID and she works as a nurse. She does have really bad anxiety. She has nothing else medical. She is just really nervous. It is not going away. She is freaking out. She would like more information. The outcome of the event &#34;It is just very annoying/It is irritating&#34; was unknown, while for the other events was not recovered.

                                                About 5 minutes after the vaccine, my tongue began tingling. I drank water but didn&#39;t tell anyone at the vaccine clinic. I did wait 17 minutes before leaving. I went to the car to look in the mirror and assess my oral airway. My tongue and pharynx were not swollen. I kept drinking water and proceeded to go home. About 10 minutes into my drive my throat became tight, so I went back and checked into the ER. My vitals were stable, and you couldn&#39;t see any swelling. My throat felt tight and my tongue tingly. I had already taken pepcid and zyrtec that morning, so they gave me Solumedrol and Benadryl IV. The tingling and tightness improved and went away by about 0930. It did return around 2300 that night (not as bad, just tongue tingly and slight tightening of my throat), and I took another pepcid and benadryl. I also had myalgias, felt febrile and fatigued for about 48 hours.  &#43;&#43;See previous VAERS report I did about vaccine #1

                                                Prior to the first dose , I felt completely healthy.  I received the first dose on a Saturday at 9am.  Felt fine most of that day other than my arm being sore, which improved with Ibuprofen.  The following day, I woke up a little achy, but felt better after taking more Ibuprofen.  Around 4-5pm on Sunday afternoon, I started feeling more achy with cold chills (highest temp was 99.5) and congestion.  I would take Ibuprofen and Tylenol, which would help.  On Monday, congestion continued, but the body aches and cold chills went away.   I did feel a little tired, but also did not sleep well due to the congestion.  Did not have any other symptoms other than the congestion and actually felt pretty good.  I worked from home on Monday to be on the safe side.   On Tuesday, I was still having congestion (still no other symptoms) and my work did not want me to return until I got checked by a doctor or get a negative covid test.  Went to an urgent care where I was seen by a doctor and tested for covid (rapid test), which came back positive.  The only other symptom that developed was loss of smell (but not sure if that was just due to the congestion -- it seemed to come and go.  Some things I could smell, some things I couldn&#39;t).  I did not lose my sense of test.  The congestion lasted less than a week.  My family quarantined for over 20 days.  We tried our best, but it was hard to isolate myself, especially from my younger kids.  No one else in the household ever developed any symptoms.  Not sure how/where I picked it up at --- We are very careful.  The only other people I saw the 2 weeks prior to testing positive were my parents and in laws at Christmas, all of which have been healthy.

                                                Received the vaccine, and was in the monitoring area.  Within ~5 minutes, I felt my throat was thickening.  I asked for water to see if that would help the sensation.  The sensation of thickness increased to a tightening and thickness and a very mild itchiness on the roof of my mouth.  I continued to feel a strong need to drink water and became extremely cold.  At about 20 minutes, my voice became hoarse.  I was given benadryl at approximately 40 minutes post injection, however the staff were communicating with people at the ER and was told that I needed an Epipen and to be transported immediately to the ER given signs of analphylaxis with the vocal change. I received the epipen about 45 minutes after injection, and a few minutes after receiving the shot, my throat felt looser. My voice continued to be hoarse. They had a very difficult time finding a vein in my arm for an IV (an I am typically very veiny).  I was transported to the ER, and given steriods and monitored.  At approximately 4 hrs post vaccine, I started to have worsening voice again, in which they gave me additional benadryl.  I continued to be monitored in the ER until 7 hrs post vaccine.  My voice continued to have moments where it was better and then it would go away again.  They offered to keep me for observation, however I declined and was discharged to home.  At home, later that night, I developed entire body itchiness, particularly over my face, and trunk.  This lasted for several days, with decreasing intensity.  My face was also very flushed looking lasting for 2 days after the reaction.  My voice returned to normal after 3 days.

After about 20 minutes my face and lips became numb, my cheeks turned red and hot to the touch, my face started to swell and it felt like my blood pressure dropped, I became dizzy. I took 50mg of Benadryl within 30 minutes of the initial onset of symptoms. All symptoms were gone within an hour of taking the benadryl. Over the next couple hours I experienced discomfort/soreness at the injection site and that tattoo on the same arm as the injection site became raised, hot and itchy. As of 3/3/2021 the only symptom remaining is the soreness at the injection site.

I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

By Saturday, the headache was back with the nausea and I began feeling very itchy. When I woke on Sunday, I had hives and a rash all over my face and most of my left side, which is the side I got my shot. Called Dr Monday and was sent to urgent care, who then sent me to the ER. Heart rate was high, hives, rash, headaches, nausea, swollen eyes and face, swollen lymph nodes

                                                Headache; taste was more impacted/ food didn&#39;t taste right/ too bitter/taste horrible; very bad migraines; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A 34-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, lot/batch number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 at 07:30AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in hospital. Medical history included tested positive for COVID-19 on 09Sep2020. She had loss of taste and smell; next day horrible diarrhea; third day she had a headache for two days; then on day four or five she got a slight fever. The whole time starting on day three her heart was racing and she couldn&#39;t sleep. States her rapid heart rate was resolved about two weeks before the vaccine. She is still recovering her sense of taste. Mentions she saw a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram that was normal in 2020. She has continued to experience the episodes of resting tachycardia but not so often now. Maybe once every two weeks. Concomitant medications were none. No vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 34-year-old on 22Dec2020 at 10:00AM in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. She had a headache and rapid heart rate that night and was up all night. It seemed like some of her COVID symptoms came back that first night. Added her arm hurt but she felt like that was related to the administration of the shot. Adds that is not how to give a shot. Adds her COVID symptoms had all gone away and then they came back but only for that first night after the first dose. Physical therapist reported that she received part two of the vaccine two weeks ago and ever since then she has had very bad migraines in Jan2021. She felt like she had recovered from the previous vaccine then she noticed her taste was more impacted on 15Jan2021. Her taste and smell was coming back from her COVID infection but after the second dose it seems like food didn&#39;t taste right. Mentions she loves Cilantro but now she can&#39;t eat it or anything citrus because it seems too bitter and Coke products taste horrible. Now she has a headache that started again on 16Jan2021. Adds normally she doesn&#39;t get headaches. She has tried rehydrating, tried drinking water and gatorade but the only thing that is helping is taking ibuprofen or Tylenol. She is rotating taking these products every other day and it is helping. Headaches come back when the medication has worn off. Patient does not require a visit to physician or ER for events. The outcome of events migraines, taste was more impacted was not recovered; unknown for another event.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                No pain or adverse event for the first 4 hours after vaccination. Starting at 2pm, which was 4 hours after my vaccine, , my chest began to tighten. It was not severe; I took a normal walk and was just mildly uncomfortable. It escalated hourly for about 10- 12 hours. At 8pm, the pain, pressure, and tightness around the chest went from mild to moderate, from a pain level of 2 to about 3 or 4. The sensation was one of a stack of books on my chest. There was pressure and mild pain (again, not severe), about 8-10 inches horizontally across my chest, from about the bottom of my sternum to the collarbone. I also felt some pressure in my lower throat, perhaps the bottom third of my neck. I did not have any shortness or breath, swelling, or difficulty swallowing. At about 9 pm, I became itchy on my neck, ankles, and flank. I developed some red spots, which were not large enough to be hives, They mostly became red from my itching, though they were more moderately itchy than seriously itchy. I have had hives before, and they did not appear to be hives, more just isolated red spots. Once I became itchy, I went to the ER. They worked me up for cardiac issues and a blot clot, but all tests were negative. I did not take any medication other than my standard Oxcarbazepine 8pm dose of 300 mg. The itchiness went away at about 11pm (two hours after onset), and the chest pain did not worsen. The following morning, it was significantly better, and about 36 hours after I first received the vaccine, it was gone entirely.

                                                Within 10 minutes of injection, patient started to say her eyes were moving by themselves behind her eye sockets and she was feeling alot of &#34;snapping&#34; in her body.  Her blood pressure and pulse were higher than normal and she could not keep her eyes open well. She was observed by nurses for approx 30 minutes and those symptoms seemed to subside although she was not steady walking. Midway into our 30 minute drive home it all started again, this time she said she felt heaviness in her chest but was pointing to her throat.  I immediately drove her directly to the ER. Was monitored for 4 hours and was release to go home, be observed and follow up with Neurologist when possible.  Throughout the night, she continued to say she was shaking alot on the inside and her eyes were still moving involuntarily.   3/20/19 at 8:30 am I called her Neurologist to inform her patients symptoms were continuing.  I waited 8 hours and called back only to have her tell her service I was to call patients Primary Physician.  Which I did.  Dr. was on call and quickly  prescribed medication to help calm patients symptoms.  She prescribed Valium 2mg q 6 hours. 3/21/19:  Patient is still experiencing shakiness, involuntary eye movement and fatigue.  She does not have arm pain at injection site.

                                                The patient was reportedly in her USOH until she received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 1/4. She woke up the following morning with a terrible headache and photophobia, later in the day developing myalgias and generalized weakness, followed by possible fever (did not take home temp). She describes the headache as a throbbing holocranial ache that is worse if she bends down She states the headache never really went away fully over the ensuing days, and she did begin to notice blurred vision in her right eye; she eventually presented to  Medical Center on 1/9, where she was tested for COVID-19 and found to be negative - her symptoms were attributed to a vaccine reaction and she was sent home. She continued to have a terrible headache and blurred vision, and so returned to Medical Center on 1/12.

Not worse at any certain time of day. &#43;Blurred vision, worse on the R. &#43;photophobia, not phonophobia. Also complains of pulsatile tinnitus happening almost daily, R-sided, worse when bending down. Denies nausea or vomiting. Denies neck pain or stiffness.

She then began had difficulty breathing and swallowing saliva. She also could not swallow a banana easily, stopped eating it. She also had some wheezing that would only go away with a cough. She took 25mg more of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and went to urgent care immediately because breathing was becoming increasingly difficult.

She came back in and said her throat is warm and scratchy, and her left hand felt cold.  ? I escorted her over to the ER and she was checked in.  I then went right back to EOHD since we were so busy.  ? Around 4pm in the afternoon after we closed EOHD, I went back to the ER.  She was recovering and doing fine.  Her ER nurse did have a question about receiving the 2nd dose, and I provided the same answer that Dr. provided to other Dr. about taking an Allegra 30 minutes before the second dose.

I had my epi pen on hand incase I needed it but I ended up taking 25mg of Benadryl, then 50 mg of Benadryl 5 hrs later. The following morning my lips where feeling tingly again so I took 25mg of Benadryl again and continued for the next 48 hrs at the advice of my doctor.

                                                I am an APRN, and received the vaccine not quite one week ago. I waited 15 minutes within the facility and then left. Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

                                                burst blood vessel in left eye/blood in her eye; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EH9899, expiry date 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left deltoid. The facility type vaccine was hospital. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis for about 8 years. No known allergies. Patient didn&#39;t do relevant test. Concomitant medication included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) for rheumatoid arthritis for 2 years, sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis for 4 months, it&#39;s unknown if they were ongoing. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient received the vaccine yesterday (23Dec2020), which she was very excited about, but today (24Dec2020) she woke up with a burst blood vessel in her left eye, she appears to have blood in her eye. This has never happened to her before. She knows this can occur with patients that have COVID but didn&#39;t know if it was a side effect to receiving the vaccine. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse event. The action taken in response to the event for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of event was not recovered. The relatedness between COVID vaccine and event &#34;burst blood vessel in left eye&#34; was related by reporter.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.; Sender&#39;s Comments: &#34;Burst blood vessel in eye&#34; is not uncommon in general population, and there are many causes of the event.  Considering temporal relationship, a contribution role of the injection of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the reported Eye haemorrhage cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 35-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose via an unknown route on the right side on 21Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included intermittent hives. Concomitant drug included ongoing cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) 5 mg for intermittent hives. The reporting nurse practitioner saw a patient on 31Dec2020 who was vaccinated on 21Dec2020 and had a Bell&#39;s Palsy reaction (reported as not serious). She did some research and saw no more incidents in the general population but she wanted to report this. She also wanted to get more information on if the patient should proceed with dose number 2 of the vaccine. The patient developed the Bell&#39;s Palsy within 5 minutes after getting the vaccine. She thought it was because she was anxious to get the vaccine, so she brushed it off. The Bell&#39;s Palsy was still occurring but per the patient it had improved. On exam she did not have any weakness, facial droop or dumbness with sharp or dull testing. The patient perceived it along the face still and the arm. The reporting nurse practitioner said that the arm was probably not Bell&#39;s Palsy, but more related to getting the vaccine in the arm and it hits a nerve. Patient stated that her smile was also unequal and it was difficult for her to close her right eye, although now (as of 31Dec2020) she can. Her right eye was irritated a little dry. Regarding treatment, the patient was started on steroids on 31Dec2020. She did not start her on an anti-viral as she did not want it to impact her immunity to the vaccine. The patient also complained of right sided ear pain. She was unsure if that was related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy, but it was also on the right side. There was fluid in the ear but no infection. The pain was still ongoing.  The patient also mentioned numbness in a small area of her tongue when she first got the vaccine. This was still ongoing. Outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy was resolving. Outcome of the event numbness in a small area of her tongue, right sided ear pain was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.     The reporting nurse practitioner stated that this was not serious as this was a mild case and was thankfully resolving. The reporting nurse practitioner comment that nothing of history was relevant besides for the last several months (as of 31Dec2020) the patient had been taking 5mg of cetirizine hydrochloride for intermittent hives. She wondered if she had not been taking it how she would have reacted or if the reaction would have been more severe.    Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the Bell&#39;s palsy and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  However, the Bell&#39;s palsy may possibly represent a concurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including viral serologies, and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 25Dec2020, the patient felt extremely tired (fatigue). On 28Dec2020, the patient had headache and minor cough noticed. On 29Dec2020, the patient experienced back pain and she said that it felt like sunburn soreness more than anything else. She said that she literally slept 3 days in a row (29Dec2020, 30Dec2020, and 31Dec2020).  On 31Dec2020, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed dizziness. On 01Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea and lost her sense of taste. COVID-19 virus test was found positive on 01Jan2021.The patient recovered from back pain, sunburn and sleepy on 31Dec2020, recovered from tiredness on 01Jan2021, recovered from nausea and dizziness on 06Jan2021. Clinical outcome of the events, smell loss, cough, headache, and loss of taste was recovering. Final clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test with symptoms was unknown at time of this report. The case was assessed as serious (medically significant). She is scheduled to get 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) on 13Jan2021 and is wanting to know if she is supposed to get it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                started having a lot of left eye pain/he diagnosed her with Scleritis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) a Nurse Practitioner, who reported for herself.  A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EJ1685 also reported as ES1685), intramuscular in left deltoid on 24Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety diagnosed years ago, maybe when she was 23. Concomitant medication included ongoing celecoxib (CELEXA) for anxiety started about a year, or year and a half ago. She did not take other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. She had no recent labs. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced scleritis. Event was described as follows: patient got her first COVID vaccine on 24Dec2020 and on 02Jan2021 she started having a lot of left eye pain. She went to her Ophthalmologist and he diagnosed her with Scleritis. She had no history of anything with her eyes or any vascular or autoimmune issues; no eye disorder history or rheumatology history. Patient is due to get her second dose of the vaccine on 14Jan2021, and she spoke with her primary care doctor and her ophthalmologist, and neither of them have any answer on if she should get the second dose or not, they did not have much guidance for her as this was such a new product. Patient reported that scleritis was persisting, but it has improved and she was on Prednisone eye drops. Event scleritis was considered serious as Medically significant because of what it is and what it can do, but this was not a severe case (as reported). Final outcome of scleritis was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported scleritis was more likely an intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Felt okay upon awakening at 06:30am. Got a shower before work. Shortly after getting out of the shower I became weak, ears started blocking, and started to have tunnel vision. Progressively got worse and was able to sit with head between legs. Took about 1 minute before I didn&#39;t feel like I was going to pass out. Shaky and weak after. Pulse 78 and oxygen level ok. Completed virtual visit and no further medical treatment advised unless symptoms got worse, but advised it was likely a vaccine reaction.  Shortly after a bad headache and body aches developed (expected side effects).

                                                I started to feel rundown/fatigued in the evening on the day I got the vaccine and my arm was very sore.  I woke up very early the next morning with a fever of 101-102, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, severe fatigue, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, I would get tunnel vision, my eyes ached and felt very strained, sinus congestion and pressure.  My fever spiked at 103.6 that evening and then stayed below 100 after that.  For the following 7 days I still had the severe fatigue, nausea, headaches, chills, dizziness, difficult concentrating, tunnel vision that was especially  bad when I had to drive, eye aches, sinus congestion and pressure, and my head felt very strange.  The best way to describe it is that I felt like someone had drugged me.  The only time I would leave my house was to take my daughter to school and when I would drive my head would feel super tight, my eye ache would intensify and they would feel super strained, I would get the tunnel vision and I would have trouble making it to the school and back home.  Then I would go back to sleep for several hours, get up and drink some fluids and go back to bed.  On day 7 or 8 I was able to stay up for periods of time and either watch movies or just lay in bed.  I went back to work on 1/20 and am doing desk work.  I am doing a lot better but still have daily headaches, moderate fatigue that is worse in the morning, mild intermittent nausea, my head still feels weird like I&#39;ve been taking some kind of pain med or mild sedative, and I&#39;m easily exhausted.  I have trouble going grocery shopping because I get exhausted.  I had a rapid COVID test done on 1/06/20 due to a headache and temp of 99.6-100.2, it was negative and we thought the temp was due to the Trokendi as that is a side effect of it.  I also had a PCR done on 1/12 that came back negative.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

I should have gone to the hospital but I have an extreme medical phobia so I stayed up and made sure my tounge didn&#39;t swell any further.  The next morning my tounge was normal ish, the red rash was gone and my hands and wrists were back to normal.  5 days later and I am still experiencing headaches, my throat feels sore and a little bit of a hard time swallowing, extreme exhaustion, dizziness, nausea, a feeling of being completely out of it, otherworldly.

I also had a metal taste in my mouth. Before the rapid heart rate started, j bad chills, diarrhea and slight body aches. For about four to five hours my heart rate resting would be 60&#39;s and when a spell came on it would rise up to high 90&#39;s. It did this off and on every couple of minutes for about four to five hours. It was a very scary situation to be in: I can handle the chills, bod aches and diarrhea but when it comes to my heart rate bouncing around and taking my breath away, that was scary.

                                                After receiving the shot at approximately 1600 (and waiting the 15 minutes at the clinic site), I returned to my desk for work.  Around 1740, I noticed a slight headache, which are abnormal for me, so I thought I might have been slightly dehydrated and increased my water intake, as well as ingested 8 ounces of gatorade.  The headache gradually got worse and by the time I left work at 2000 (8PM), it was so bad on the (primarily) right front part of my head (around my temple and behind my right eye), noise, light, and even my own walking hurt terribly.  I have never had a migraine in my life and rarely even get headaches, but the pain of this headache far surpassed any I have experienced before and based on what others tell me, might have been a migraine.  By the time I got home around 2100 (9PM), I took two extra strength Tylenol tablets and went to bed.  When I awoke in the morning around 0900 (9AM), I had a slight headache that dissipated after I took two more Tylenol tablets and did not return.

This 35-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3249) intramuscular, in left arm, on 22Jan2021 at 08:00, for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine was given on the same day or in 4 weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine on 04Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, lot number EK9231, intramuscular, in left arm. Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease. The patient had no COVID before vaccination. Concomitant medication included azathioprine (IMURAN) at 150 mg, daily. On 22Jan2021 the patient experienced warm flushing within 5 minutes of vaccination and at 08:15 tachycardia (HR into 140s), numbness and tingling around lips. The events required Emergency room/department or urgent care and treatment with diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) 25 mg IV. COVID was not tested after vaccination. The events were resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association, causality between events tachycardia (HR into 140s), numbness and tingling around lips and warm flushing and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded.

This 35-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EL3302, Expiration Date: 31Mar2021) at 0.3 mL single use in right deltoid on 21Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was on 31Dec2020 and experienced night sweat, even after her first dose they had not gone away.

Medical history included factor V leiden, it&#39;s a blood clotting &#34;supporter&#34; (not clarified); asthma. Concomitant medication was not reported. Patient had temperature of 101, chills, lost her sense of taste and body ache in Jan2021. Patient received her second vaccine on the 21Jan2021 on Thursday and she had all the typical side effects startling on Friday with fever, chills, had a temperature of 101 and all the simple stuff and she lost her sense of taste on Saturday evening and it hadn&#39;t returned yet and she was trying to see if that was a possible side effect of the vaccine or what. When probed if the events had been worsened, improved or persisting, patient stated so improved for everything except one. So she got the sot on Thursday and it worsened meaning the fever started Thursday night, Friday all day she had a fever of 101, body ache and chills all that stuff but Saturday her fever went away but she lost her sense of taste on Saturday, so the fever and everything was OK. Patient had taken naproxen and ibuprofen. The outcome of events was reported as recovered in Jan2021.

I woke up Thursday 02/11 morning not feeling well at all, it felt like i had been hit by a train. I had a fever that has got up to  as high as 101.3 (my normal temperature is 96 or low 97&#39;s so this is very unusual for me even when i get sick)  fevers  lasted until Saturday 02/13/21 in the morning, at which point I had been taking Tylenol and ibuprofen consistently so i stopped taking my temperature (If i were to stop taking those medications i feel i would maybe still have a temperature).  I was so sore it hurt to move and walk, today (Tue 02/16) it doesn&#39;t hurt to walk finally. My arm pits hurt very bad and still slightly hurt. I have been very tired and weak as well. My eyes have hurt or felt different and appear glossy throughout all of this and still do.

I was taken to the ER and was administed benedryl.  I was transported to the hospital via ambulance because my mouth and throat was extremely dry and my voice got hardened.  During the ride I regurgiatated because my stomach got queezy and was administered Zofran.  My right hand turned completely white and I was administered another med to help turn my hand back right.  My baby was checked and she was fine and was released after about 3 hrs.  At that time I was 31 week gestation.  Until about 3 days ago my body was still very very itchy all over which seemed to worsen when I was sleep.

On 2/27/21 there was a noticeable red patch on the eyelid with small scaly looking spots, I assumed it to be a patch of dry skin. There was a 30 minute period of intense tingling pain and shooting/stabbing intermittent pain. There was also some numbness later on that day. Also on 2/27/21 I noticed a large lymphnode swelling on my jawline adjacent to my left ear. On 3/1/21 I saw my primary care provider and was diagnosed with shingles. After reviewing the preliminary symptoms of shingles, I had been experiencing abnormal fatigue and stomach upset for about 5 days prior to the eruption.

Around 9:45 started preparing for the next day (getting coffee pot ready, etc.) up until this moment I had no side effects except pain in my arm.  Then at 9:45PM I began feeling light headed, ringing in my ears and fell unconscious. I woke up on my kitchen floor in a small pool of blood and disoriented. I do believe this reaction is related to the vaccine. I DO NOT have a history of fainting. I ate food and drank plenty of water throughout the day and after my vaccine injection. Everything about my day was typical except for the vaccination and losing consciousness.

Those symptoms lasted for about 3-4 days. Then on Sunday morning February 14 I work up with sciatic pain on my left leg. Then on Monday February 15 my right eye was red after I woke up that morning. Gradually during the week my eye continued to be red, blurry, and eventually cloudy Friday morning February 19. Found an eye doctor who could see me that morning. He diagnose me having Iritis and prescribed me durezol eye drops. I had to put one drop every 2hr until it gradually got better. I&#39;m still under his care.

A 35-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at 15:30 (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insulin resistance, vitamin D deficiency, GERD (Gastrooesophageal reflux disease) and allergy to pollen and possible allergy to cilantro. Prior to the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included metformin, famotidine (PEPCID [FAMOTIDINE]), clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN]), topirmate, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); all for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took pregabalin (LYRICA) from an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. On 01Feb2021 at 06:00, the patient experienced hives and swollen eye. The patient reported that the first vaccine was administered and the patient was fine then the patient had hives and swollen eye on the day the second dose was to be administered. The second dose of the vaccine was delayed. The events resulted in an emergency room/urgent care visit and the patient received treatment for the events with solumedrol shot and prednisone oral with benadryl/pepcid/atarax.  The patient received the second dose one week later, on Friday 05Feb2021, with prednisone on board. The clinical outcomes of the hives and swollen eye were recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient had been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Swollen eyes and Hives cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

Then I went to the ER and they have me a steroid and  Pepcid. I went home, and I was still very itchy. Then I went to urgent care and they repeated the treatment and I was fine by the 3rd day. I went to see my allergist and he wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to the vaccine. I was instructed to take the 2nd dose, but to take meds first. I took antihistamines before 2nd dose and I was fine.

That pain was intermittent for a few hours and dissipated by early evening  of the day of the shot.  My left lip and left side of throat had minor feeling of tingly burn when I was driving home 30 minutes after I had the shot. Stiff muscles on left side of neck. Intermittent mild muscle pinching along left side of body but went away by Friday night.

                                                Six days after receiving vaccine, began feeling unwell. Symptoms are extreme fatigue, red eyes, sore eyes, body aches, joint pain, pain around back/ribs, shortness of breath on exertion. Unable to do usual household tasks and requiring bedrest for much of the day.   The symptoms are very similar to the waves of symptoms I experienced early on in Post-Acute Covid-19 syndrome. I got sick in March and was experiencing waves like this through November. Since November, my physical symptoms had abated and I had not suffered a major relapse like this, besides a mild relapse at end of January. My shortness of breath issues, back pain/rib pain, eye soreness are very specific symptoms that I associate with early on in my long covid experience. The vaccine seems to have triggered a major relapse in my long covid symptoms.

                                                Experienced moderate headaches everyday for 7 days following first series of vaccine. (NDC el9263) On day 7, woke up in the middle of the night with intense nausea and headache. First thought to have food poisoning because husband who received the same vaccine also had similar symptoms. Both vomited multiple times and experienced severe headaches. After second series of vaccine (NDC en 6201), experienced headaches everyday again which required in taking multiple doses of ibuprofen. On day 7, woke up in the middle of the night with intense headache. Developed intense nausea, headache, neck pain, stiffness, light sensitivity, watery eyes, congestion and could not continue to work. Took multiple doses of advil and had to take off work. No vomiting occurred. Did not see a physician but consulted a coworker/neurologist friend who thought I fit the description of aseptic meningitis. No lumbar puncture or laboratory evaluation was done. Rechallenge was positive.

Fire department came and blood pressure was high, heart rate was high, blood sugar was low. Fire fighter noticed hives on right shoulder (shot was administered in left arm) and they could see hives spreading across chest and neck. Hives covered upper torso but did not spread to abdomen or legs. Tongue swelled more making speech difficult. Breathing was easy, no constriction or wheezing heard through stethoscope. Vitals  taken 2 or 3 more times, becoming more regular each time.  Fire fighters provided Gatorade and discussed options. Fire department left at 4:10. I took Benadryl and Pepcid at 4:15.  Tongue swelling decreased around 6 pm, but remained slightly swollen until 3/14/21. Hives visible and itchy until 3/15/21. Other symptoms included fatigue, dizziness, body aches. Triamcinolone was used topically on hives twice daily on 3/13/21 and 3/14/21.

These symptoms continued along with blurry vision, dizziness, waking at night to ?buzzing? in head, hypoglycemic symptoms. Multiple doctors visits over the past two months, blood tests, BP and heart rate assessments - only to assume it?s  a reaction to the vaccine. Extreme diet change, elimination of the two prescribed meds and detox- feeling much better however still experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms throughout the day and sometimes at night.

On March 6th, I suddenly developed double vision.  The low grade fever and feeling poorly (other than fatigue) subsided around March 7-8; however, the double vision persists.  It is very difficult to focus at times and drive and perform some other activities that require visual focus at medium to far distances.

I could only lift my arm halfway up, due to the deep muscle pain.

                                                I tested positive for COVID on January 24th.  I never had a fever throuhgout my illness; however I did have mild cold symptoms, and lost all sense of taste and smell.  My taste and smell just started to return a few weeks ago.   I received the Pfizer vaccine on Friday, March 12th.  On Monday, March 15th, I lost all smell and taste.  When I completed a virtual care visit, I was advised that since I had COVID within the past 12 weeks, I was not eligible to be retested for COVID.  However, I was informed that loss of taste and smell were not side effects of the vaccine and that I needed to go home and quarantine for 2 weeks.    I requested a second opinion, and was instructed from my second opinion to get retested (although this was against routine CDC guidelines).  My retest was negative for COVID.  I have been advised that my loss of taste and smell should be reported to the CDC as a side effect of the vaccine.  I still do not have taste or smell as of March 20.

A 35-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 11Feb2021 08:15 at a single dose (at the age of 35-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation; vaccinated in a hospital. Medical history was not reported. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included escitalopram. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Six days after the vaccine (17Feb2021), the patient developed unilateral left ear symptoms such as muffled hearing, mild pain, pressure, tinnitus, which then progressed to mild hearing loss. After about 7 days of ear discomfort that worsened (2 weeks exactly after first dose of vaccine), the patient developed left sided facial paralysis. The patient was seen by ENT, had a full workup including hearing test and head MRI with contrast. Came back normal aside for some findings of inflammation on the 8th nerve. The patient was placed on acyclovir 500mg 3x a day for 7 days and 60 mg of prednisone for 7 days with a 9 day taper. The facial paralysis completely recovered after 2-3 full weeks. The ear was mostly recovered with some residual tinnitus. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient required a visit to the doctor and emergency room for the events. The patient recovered from left sided facial paralysis in Mar2021. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering plausible temporal association and lack of alternative explanations, the events left ear hearing loss, inflammation on the 8th nerve, and left sided facial paralysis are possibly related to BNT162B2.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed in 2019, autoimmune disorder and anxiety from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included diazepam (VALIUM) taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; paracetamol (TYLENOL A) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps (arrhythmia) on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered  sob and dates for getting really winded (dyspnoea)  on Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, her heart was racing on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really winded on 22Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, for the 4-5 days after receiving her covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30am since it started on 20mar2021 with outcome of unknown, extremely thirsty on 20Mar2021 with outcome of unknown,  low grade fevers  on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Additional details were provided as: &#34;I started having a reaction within 12 hours of the shot that persisted. Four (4) days after I was at urgent care and was sent to see a cardiologist due to SOB and heart rate jumps that were happening.&#34; In the past two weeks the patient has seen the cardiologist, had ekgs and echos completed and and now is being sent to see an electrophysiologist. The cardiologist wants her to postpone the second dose until she sees the electrophysiologist since he doesn&#39;t know if this is exacerbation of something or was caused by the vaccine. She had her first dose on 19Mar2021 around 12:45PM-1:00PM in the afternoon. After her vaccine she was ok. She had actually taken a Valium before she went to get the Covid 19 vaccine because she was nervous. She doesn&#39;t know if taking the Valium before getting the Covid 19 vaccine had anything to do with her delayed reaction. She does not take the Valium every day. She woke up around 1:30AM Saturday morning, 20Mar2021 and her heart was racing. Her mother is a nurse and her mother came over the next day to monitor her. Her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps. Even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s. (beats per minute) She and her mother monitored her heart for a while and she called the clinic where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and the nurse told her to go to an Urgent Care. She does report she has an autoimmune disease and she was wondering if she was having a flare up that the Covid 19 vaccine had caused. She could not find a doctor to talk to her about it. Even her primary care doctor wouldn&#39;t help her. Everyone told her to go to an Urgent Care or the emergency room. On Monday, 22Mar2021, she tried to get up and move around but she was getting really winded. She was trying to do things she normally does like walking in her backyard or walking down the hallway. On Tuesday, 23Mar2021 she went to the urgent care. The urgent care did an EKG and told her she needed to see a cardiologist. She was able to see a cardiologist the next day on Tuesday, 24Mar2021. The cardiologist had her wear a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rate for 24 hours. The results showed that she was having arrhythmias, heart rate jumps. The cardiologist did more EKG&#39;s and an echocardiogram. The cardiologist wants her to see an electrophysiologist because of what he saw on the Holter monitor. She is asking if it&#39;s possible that she had a heart issue before and the Covid 19 vaccine brought it to the surface. She&#39;s read things online where people have had similar symptoms. Is it a side effect? She would also like to report that for the 4-5 days after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30AM since it started on 20Mar2021. She&#39;s unsure if she should get the second Covid 19 vaccine. Her second appointment is scheduled for this Friday, 09Apr2021. When she woke up that morning of 20Mar2021 she was extremely thirsty. She reports she does not drink alcohol because of her autoimmune disease, but the thirst she experienced felt like she had been drinking alcohol and was experiencing the extreme thirst that comes with a hangover. The first 5 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine were the worst and that&#39;s why she decided to go to the urgent care. Her heartrate hasn&#39;t improved. Her windedness had improved by the tenth or eleventh day. She can go on a walk and jump up and down with her daughter now. The windedness is lingering a little but is definitely improved. Her autoimmune disease is called Mixed Connective Tissue. She takes no medications for it. She manages it with her diet. Her mother had called her rheumatologist on call on Monday night, 22Mar2021 and asked him is there anything the caller can do or anything she can take. The rheumatologist on call told her to take Aleve.  She didn&#39;t take Aleve but she did take Tylenol and then hours later she took Advil. She does normally run low grade fevers with her autoimmune disease. The fevers are never high, usually around 99.8F never going over 100F. The low grade fevers have been occurring prior to the Covid 19 vaccine for years. She reports that after she took the Tylenol (Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, she took 2 tablets) and then the Advil (Advil 200mg, she took 1 tablet), she felt drugged, like totally out of it. So tired she couldn&#39;t move. And she&#39;s taken those medications before and never felt like that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: arrhythmias, heart rate jumps   on 23Mar2021. No follow-up attempts are possible; no further information expected.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Apr2021 12:15, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a drug store. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no prior COVID-19 and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. Concomitant medication included minerals nos, vitamins nos (PRENATAL VITAMINS). The patient did not received other vaccines in four weeks. On 07Apr2021 at 03:00, the patient went to the bathroom and felt fine. She sat on the toilet and all of a sudden felt dizzy and nauseous. Next thing she knew, she woke up on the floor and had a huge bump on her head near her left eye. She passed out and hit her head on the tile in the bathroom. Her left eye was half swollen shut, her eyelid and under eye were black, was very swollen all over her head and eye and was in lots of pain. She went to the emergency room around 04:30. All tests, CT scan and blood work came back normal. She was told that it was most likely caused by the vaccine. Treatment for the events included &#34;CT scan, bloodwork, IV fluids&#34; (as reported). She was hoping that Pfizer will pay for her ER visit since the events were vaccine reactions. She reported that she was still in lots of pain and was not taking pain meds because she was breastfeeding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician office visits. The outcome of pain was not recovered. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021442302 Baby case

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

                                                On 1/6 at approximately 9am hour, I noticed joint pain in my fingers while typing, muscle soreness in my upper back, a headache, and a slightly sore throat. It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EK5730), via intramuscular in left deltoid  on 21Dec2020 10:00 at 0.3 ml, single for precaution as front line healthcare worker in hospital which is not a military facility.  Medical history included nonsmoker. She did not provide causality but stated that she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis as she had never been tested. Other history was none. The patient did not have a history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, immunosuppressive disorder, obesity. There was not any pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The patient hadn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. Concomitant medication included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN SR), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were none. AE following prior vaccinations were none. There was no additional vaccines administered on Same Date (21Dec2020) of the Pfizer bnt162b2. The patient got the covid 19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 24Dec2020. The patient wanted guidance on receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The reporter considered event was non-serious. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and after that on 24Dec2020, she tested positive for COVID . She was supposed to be revaccinated on 07Jan2021. She would like to know if she should she get this or does she need to be revaccinated. There is no prescriber. She received it through her work. She received the first dose on 21Dec2020, and assumed she was positive when she got it. She just had cough and muscle aches and a headache. Her dad was hospitalized. Hers was not that serious. She had not completely recovered yet. Her smell had not come back yet and she was just tired still. She said the headache was prior to getting vaccine. She did not provide causality but stated that she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine. The cough occurred on 25Dec2020, muscle aches on 22Dec2020 at 08:00. There was no emergency room of or physician&#39;s office required for the events. The patient was not hospitalized or admitted to an ICU. Nasal swab test done. Imaging for COVID-Pneumonia, other radiological investigations, hematology, clinical chemistry, inflammatory markers, urinalysis, evidence of hypoxemia, other relevant test were none. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO) or receive mechanical ventilation. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID-19. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure.  She did start taking extra vitamins on her own. The patient was recovered with some lasting effects such as not being able to smell and is tired still.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID with symptoms and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, bnt162b2.  However, as the reporter claimed &#34;she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine&#34;, this may provide  an alternative explanation.

                                                I received the Covid-19 vaccine on 01/20/2021 and had tingling/slight numbness in my left arm (injection arm). Later in the evening I had the same feeling in my left leg and in my cheeks, lips, tongue and teeth. I felt like I had been numbed at the dentist, but was coming out of the numbness. It was like when the numbness is mostly gone and you&#39;re left with that tingling sensation, and your face feels puffy. It was basically that feeling in my face, left leg, and left arm. Those sensations are mostly gone today (the second day following), but not quite.

Today upon waking tightness in chest felt intensified and continues now (evening). Midday experienced sudden vertigo and double vision lasting over a minute along with dizziness. I had already eaten lunch. Primary Dr ordered me to emergency room. Extensive testing along with chest x-ray and EKG performed. No abnormalities were found.  ED doctor said a State test of some sort would tell us if it is an actual allergic reaction or an intensive immune response. He said it would take a few days for results.  I was given diagnosis of vaccine reaction and sent home for rest. Advised to return if symptoms get worse. Tightness in chest continues at this time. Fatigue and headache have also returned.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name).

As such per the guidance I remained in the waiting room for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I had a light rash on both forearms and near the injection site on my left upper arm. I felt fine otherwise. I went up to the nurse in the monitoring room and showed her the rash. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. At the time I was not. She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated. It proceeded to get worse and when I looked at my throat in the mirror it was very red and starting to be visibly swollen. I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in to the emergency room.

No medications could touch the pain and it felt like my brain and eyeballs were going to explor; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable self-reporting other health professional.  A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686), intramuscularly on an unspecified date in Jan2021 at 13:00  (at the age of 36-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included anaphylactic reactions to penicillin and pistachios. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The vaccine was administered to the patient in a hospital. The patient reported that twenty-four hours after administration she developed a searing migraine that lasted for approximately fifteen hours. She stated that &#34;no medications could touch the pain&#34; and it felt like her brain and eyeballs were going to explode.  The patient specified that she did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcomes of migraine, sensation of pressure and eye discomfort were reported as recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I initially had itchiness at injection site, then more of my arm. At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

                                                My symptom began with an itchy spot on my left forearm advancing to the back of my neck and head followed by a rash. The rash extended over my neck, chest, face, spreading to entire body. The left side of my lip also had swollen and became tingly. All symptoms started roughly at 3am on 3/4/21. I took ibuprofen 800mg along with Benadryl 25mg. At 0730am rash had dissipated some and most of the itching subsided, another Benadryl 25mg tablet was taken. At 1030am, rash had dissipated except still remaining on both elbow areas, non itching at this point. At 1230, another Benadryl was taken.

Approximately 15-20 minutes after dose was administered I began feeling a reaction. The skin on my face, neck, and chest became red, flushed, warm, splotchy, and itchy. My tongue and throat began to feel swollen/tight. I was also lightheaded and dizzy. My husband was driving the car and we almost returned to the vaccination site, but after approximately 5 more minutes, the tightness in my throat subsided, so we continued to go home. The flushing and lightheaded-ness went away after approximately 20 minutes. This is similar to the reactions I had just before I discontinued taking copaxone (approx. 2 years ago). I did not feel this way after dose one of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

These balance issues are slowly improving but remain ever present. I am also experiencing some cognitive issues including word finding problems, difficulty processing verbal information, and general brain fog. I?ve had an increase in fatigue as well. The same weekend the balance issues began I had some visual disturbances as well.

                                                This morning I woke up swollen under my eyes right where I had filler done; The swelling and tenderness is the exact same swelling and tenderness experienced right after the filler was done; achy and tired; achy and tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 36-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 36-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Celiac disease, allergy to gluten, filler under eyes in Jul2020, and the patient is prone to inflammation. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included GUARANA [PAULLINIA CUPANA] and a multivitamin, both from an unknown date for an unknown indication.

On 07Feb2021 at 06:30, the second day after the second immunization, the patient woke up swollen under her eyes right where she previously had filler done (last Jul2020, so per the patient, it wasn&#39;t recent).

                                                A few hours after vaccine began getting itchy all over and slight numbness on left side. Went to ER and was given benadryl. The next morning 3/22 I woke up with hair feeling in my throat and heart palpitations. Went back er BP and treated with hydrolyzed hcl, Famotadine, lorazepam and Prednisone. By the evening 911 was called and I was taken back to er BP for heart rate of 150 &#43;, light headed and nausea. I was treated with clonazepam and discharged that night. On today 3/26 I am still experiencing fast heart rate and taking atarax as needed.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6208) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Mar2021 14:45 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included epilepsy and asthma. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levetiracetam. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6203) administered in left arm on 28Feb2021 14:30 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had the normal yet severe side effects of sore arm &amp; neck, stiffness behind the ear, stiffness of the neck and injection site arm, fatigue, fever, headache, sore throat, chills, for the first few days her 2nd dose. But on day 2, she started suffering from tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, confusion in both ears and increased seizure activity. The events started about 2 days after the second shot on 23Mar2021 12:00 PM; its been a week now and it still hasn&#39;t gotten better or gone away. She had an appointment with her pcp tomorrow but so far nothing has helped. Its debilitating and extremely hard to focus &amp; function. She mainly just wanted to know if any other vaccine trial participant/recipients have reported anything similar &amp; if so, how long can she expect this to last. The adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. No COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

This 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number ER8731, expiration date 31Jul2021, on 14Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included lupus, COPD, diabetes which her mother had and she basically got it so she could be around her mother. Concomitant medication was none. The patient had the shot last Wednesday (14Apr2021) and then by Saturday (17Apr2021) she had severe neck pain and stiffness in her neck, she couldn&#39;t move her neck. The pain was ongoing. She had no rash on her arm but she had rash all over her neck and she went to the doctor and they gave her a steroid shot because they thought maybe it could be something different. She had the steroid and she still breaking out in hives through out her body. They gave her a steroid shot on Monday (19Apr2021) but the rash had gone on to her face, her lip was swollen, there were bumps underneath her lip and the rash was going inside her mouth and even though she got the steroid shot she was still breaking out in new hives. She said she was going to have to go and go back to work she thought this was going to be quick and it was not. She did not have the name of the steroid injection or have a lot expiration to provide. They also gave her Naproxen for the stiffness in her neck and a muscle relaxer. The outcome of stiffness in her neck, pain neck and rash all over her neck/rash has gone on to her face was not resolved. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected.

These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

She said she did to morphine. Her bp was 119/74 with a pulse of 94. She said her nose was starting to get itchy, her ears and scalp were itchy, and her eyes were blurry. She had red blotches all over her neck and chest. She said her throat was tight. She was able to swallow the water she requested. I gave her 50mg of benadryl.  She had no visible signs of being unable to breathe. I explained to her we could call 911. She reported she had no insurance. She said she was on her lunch break at the hospital and wanted to get back. She did walk back across the street unassisted. Clinical observer, followed her over just to verify she made it in the building. She ended up checking herself into the ER instead of returning to her shift.

                                                About 12-13 minutes into my wait after getting the vaccination... my throat had a tickle in it... like I needed to clear my throat.  So I did... and then again.... and again.    Then I felt dizzy and disoriented... foggy headed kind of drunk feeling.    Then within what seemed like seconds... my mouth felt full so I opened my mouth and looked in the mirror.   My tongue seemed bigger than usual and lighter in color.  But what was most noticeable was that I had Ripples along the whole outer edge and side of my tongue.    pulse ox reading was an 89 so they administered a prescription strength Benadryl shot and told me they would need to monitor me and keep an eye on me.  Another woman drove me from the vaccination site to the clinic where they checked my oxygen levels again and i was already back up to 99.  They monitored me and checked on me for about 15-20 minutes before releasing me.  My tongue finally felt normal again about 2 hours later while resting at home.

Approximately 10 minutes into this observation she reported tingling around her lips that resolved within approximately 20 minutes.  She does not feel she was anxious and hyperventilating when this occurred.  She was released and went back to work.  Within approximately 30 minutes of being back to work her coworker commented that she had hives on her forehead.  These were described as two blotchy areas and were slightly pruritic.  They resolved without treatment within approximately one hour.

                                                suspect that it may be Bell&#39;s Palsy; tingling in the left side of her tongue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 37-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), intramuscularly at 0.3ml single injection in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included persimmon fruit allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced tingling in the left side of her tongue on 22Dec2020, the event was reported as serious per medically significant, suspect that it may be bell&#39;s palsy on an unspecified date. The adverse event was not required a visit to emergency room or physician office. Caller was an employee health nurse that reported that she had an employee that received the first dose Covid-19 vaccine on 22Dec2020 and as they were administering the vaccine, the patient developed tingling in the left side of her tongue. The caller said that the patient reported that the tingling was still there. She said that the patient was concerned that it might cause her to get bell&#39;s palsy. Caller wanted to know if this was this common and whether she could move forward with getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The caller said that the patient received the vaccine in her left arm. The caller said that the patient reported that the tingling in her tongue was mild and not stopping her from eating and she was not having any respiratory issues. Caller said that the only allergy that the patient has was to Persimmon fruit. The side effect mentioned is not necessarily Bell&#39;s palsy since the characteristic eye drooping is not present. The outcome of events for tingling in the left side of her tongue was not resolved, for suspect that it may be bell&#39;s palsy was unknown. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. Vaccine Administered at Military Facility: No. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No relevant tests. Drug result was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causality between the reported tingling in the left side of her tongue, which was suspected that it may be Bell&#39;s Palsy and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, cannot be denied, based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

I thought it was allergies associated with changing weather and I wasn?t running fever so I continued to go to work. Two days later I still had no fever, but got dizzy and started feeling bad. I went and got tested that night and tested positive for the virus.  My eyes have itch and burned, but I still have never run and fever and didn?t loose my Sense of smell until 5 days after symptoms first started. My cough got worse and I have also had sneezing.

The next day or so I went to neurology who ordered blood tests (Lyme&#39;s, Vitamin deficiencies, Sjrogen&#39;s antigens, CRP, ferritin, Copper, ACE, TSH, Vitamin D , ANA) that were all negative.  Next I had a MRI of the head and spine with and without contrast which was normal.  The pins and needs have now spread all over my body.  I full body neuropathic pain (burning sensation, numbness, tingling, sharp pain like stabbing, left eye pain, feeling like bugs are walking on me, and zapping pain).  Neurology is continuing to work up my symptoms but they were new onset after COVID vaccine.

                                                Left arm became very sore after about 8 hours after each dose. After the 2nd day after each injection, a wave of exhaustion hit me. About 10 days after the first injection, I felt a tingling in my lip and a cold sore erupted. Then another! I&#39;ve never had 2 at the same time. One on the top lip and one on the bottom. I haven&#39;t had a cold sore in 15 years. I had my 2nd titer on February 3rd. On February 15th I had another eruption of another cold sore.  I didn&#39;t think the first recurrence of a cold sore was linked to the vaccine, but the timing of the 2nd one is beyond coincidental, which is why I&#39;m reporting it. Abreva is not helping too much. I haven&#39;t had a herpes breakout since 2006.

On the fourth day after the shot, I developed shingles on my left side (the same side as where I received the vaccine). It began on the left side of my scalp and progressed down my forehead and to my left eye. My left eye also became very swollen, to the point of being shut.   I am 12 days post vaccine now, and I still have shingles and my eye is still very swollen. I have been seen at both the ER and urgent care. I am currently taking Valtrex, oral steroids, and have antibiotic ointment for my eye as well as steroid eye drops.

I waited and it progressively got worse. it felt like I had phlegm stuck in my throat that I could not get out. nurses at the drive offered to call 911 but I was close enough to an Urgent care/ER that I decided to drive myself over there. they took me in, started an IV and gave me 50mg of epinephrine and Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid. they prescribed an EpiPen. They told me to continue taking Benadryl because the allergic reaction could resurface. cough is still present and I have body aches.

                                                stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast; stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast; coffee (which is what has been tasting weird), tasted so gross; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient herself). A 37-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL3302, Expiry date: unknown), at 37 years of age via an unspecified route of administration on Left arm on 01Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication included multivitamin (unspecified) and estradiol (ESTROGEN) as a supplement within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1685, Expiry date: unknown) on 07Jan2021 at 09:30 AM on left arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Exactly two weeks after the first vaccine I started smelling cigarette smoke and a sweet garlicky smell. Things tasted a little funny, but I mostly noticed it with coffee. Patient also had known allergies to clindamycin and Sulfa. The patient stated that, things tasted a little funny, but I mostly noticed it with coffee. I didn&#39;t think about the COVID shot, I just thought maybe I had a cold. Then exactly two weeks after the second, my coffee (which is what has been tasting weird), tasted so gross I had to throw it out in Feb2021. That&#39;s when I put it all together that it is probably from the vaccine. Then the more I research that sweet garlic is actually yeast I am smelling. Then I realized since all this has started by in Feb2021 stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast and sure enough I googled it and it looks similar. My co-worker is having a yeast infection also, but it is only in her mouth. The patient received treatment for the events with diflucan 150mg a 20-week cycle. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. The outcome of the events was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal relationship, the causality between the suspect &#39;BNT162B2&#39; and the reported &#39;stools have been weird looking and smelly, like yeast&#39; cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

They are circular in shape and the skin between my toes hurt. The rash covers the majority of the tops of my feet. They are itchy. I have almost slept since 8pm last night and it is now 3:15 the following afternoon. My husband had difficulty waking me up. I have been extremely foggy and jumbleing my words each time I wake up and when I try to text I dont realize I&#39;m typing words that do not make sense.  I also have the normal symptoms like headache and sore arm. Tops of my hands seem puffy and red.  Extreme thirst and hunger.

                                                Immediately after injection I felt a tingling in my back that went away within 25 minutes. My left arm started tingling/feeling numb in small areas starting days after injection from vaccine site up to my neck. Days later it spread down to my left hand. It has now been over a month straight of my entire left arm and left hand tingling/feeling numb, with my hand and fingertips being the worst. The symptoms affect me all day every. I?ve also had very bad headaches with the pain behind my eyes multiple times a week since the injection.

Small rash will sometimes appear however after a few hours will go away.  Benadryl will sometimes help however the itching is not getting better on its own.  Predominately located on all 4 limbs, neck and chest.  Itching is worse towards end of the day, especially at night and for short durations throughout remainder of the day.  Itching to the point of breaking skin to relieve and even then it continues.  I have increased water intake and have to take benadryl at night to even get some rest however once the benadryl wears off it comes back and almost worse.

I noticed my vision was blurred. I couldn&#39;t see freckles on my arms that I usually can see. After 40 mins the numbness improved. On the drive home I was swept with head-to-toe numbness for about a min with the feeling like I was going to throw up and chest pain.  The chest pain continued to come and go a few times for the next 10-12 hours. I was very dizzy and very weak. My vision went back to normal about 5 hours later. But I remained dizzy and weak for about a week. I still have dizziness on and off throughout the day that I never had before though.  All those symptoms I feel like are outside of what was expected and concern me but other than that I had symptoms that I expected as well like my arms was sore for maybe 3 hours total the day after, I was tired, and had an elevated temp around 100 degrees.

SIG: Pharmacist Administered Immunization   What happened (Describe in detail, what occurred)? * The patient came in for a covid vaccine; this was the first of a 2 series of Pfizer. * The pharmacist injected the immunization and a few minutes afterwards the husband called for the pharmacist to come because his wife didn&#39;t feel well. She immediately became unresponsive and her eyes rolled back into her head but she came to. She was responding somewhat to questions but she was also slightly mentally impaired at baseline due to her co-morbidities. She never fell to the ground or wanted to lie down, so not a true faint. * The pharmacist offered to call 911 but they both declined. The patient was given water and a banana and taken to a private area to recover until she fell well enough to leave.  How did it happen? * The Pharmacist administered an appropriate, routine vaccine per protocol. *Patient had an somewhat immediate reaction (~4 minutes) after the vaccine. *The pharmacist followed the adverse event protocol. CPR was not administered nor benadryl.  Why did it happen (Root Causes)? * Unknown; patient has no known allergy to the vaccine but has had adverse reactions to different procedures in the past.  Plan of Action * Make sure all pharmacists are refreshed and aware of the adverse reaction protocol. *Document reaction as a SCRT and with VAERS. What specific task will take place to prevent future recurrence? *N/A. Who: * Pharmacist Where: * clinic When: *All pharmacists at location must review by 3/20.

About  01:00, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain. I had hives all over me. Hives were spreading all over my body: hair; arm with the injection; we called 9-1-1 I went to the hospital. They gave me some meds through IV. By that time, I had taken Bendryl and I was there about 4 hours with IV. I felt better but hives didn&#39;t subside. That Sunday afternoon they started getting worse again and I went back to the hospital  (16th)and they gave me rounds of something through IV.  On 17th, I went back to hospital - they gave me another shot for the hives. I worked on the 18th - but was they said I should go home because I didn&#39;t look well. My lip started swelling that night. On the 19th, I went to my doctor and the Dr, used an epi-pen on me and gave me a shot of something for the  welts still on my body. They still didn&#39;t go away.  Symptoms have calmed down - but I still have spots on me. I am on Prilosec and anti-itch - Atarax and some others.

A contactable female consumer (patient) reported that a 37-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Batch/lot number: EL1284) first dose, intramuscular on 11Jan2021 between 9-9:30 a.m at SINGLE DOSE at Right upper arm for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced she tested positive- 5/tested positive for covid-19 on 18Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, loss of taste on 18Jan2021 02:00 with outcome of recovered on 23Jan2021, loss of smell on 18Jan2021 02:00 with outcome of recovered 23Jan2021.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test (COVID-19 Rapid Test): positive on 18Jan2021, sars-cov-2 test (COVID-19 Test): inconclusive on 29Jan2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Caller was scheduled today for the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. However, 2 weeks ago she tested positive- 5 days after the 1st dose of the vaccine. Today, she had no symptoms for over a week and she didn&#39;t know yet if she was still positive for COVID or not. Caller was asking if she can take the 2nd dose today or if she needed to wait for days/weeks before taking it. On 11Jan2021, the caller received her first dose of COVID-19. On 18Jan2021, the caller tested positive for COVID-19. She was symptom free after 5 days. She was scheduled to receive her second dose at 12:00pm today. She stated she has been getting conflicting information. She wanted to know can she receive the second vaccine? Since 23Jan2021, she has been symptom free. She mentioned she filled out a questionnaire online about and she did respond that she tested positive after receiving the first dose, but she never heard anything back. Caller stated she noticed probably around 2 am in the morning on 18Jan, she had that feeling in my throat where she was losing her sense of smell and taste. She woke up that morning around 8am, and these senses were completely gone. Caller stated it was the only symptom she had. She confirmed she had a COVID-19 Rapid test done on 18Jan2021. She actually went and got tested again on Friday, 29Jan2021, to see if she still had COVID. However, the person doing the test must not have done it right. The person only swabbed one nostril and the test came back inconclusive as of yesterday. The events not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office.   No further information was provided or obtained.

Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

                                                About 30 minutes after my injection, I started to feel a tingly feeling in my throat, then felt like my throat was slightly tightening. I was driving and pulled over to monitor. It stayed the same for about 10 minutes, then started resolving. I never had any trouble breathing and I could sip water. When I returned home, my husband commented that I looked  ?flushed.?  I called my PCP who recommended to monitor myself, but that I was probably fine and no need for any treatment. I have not had any issues since and now am 24 hours post injection. There is no phone number to the site in which I received my vaccine. I have been trying to connect with someone who can advise on whether it is safe for me to receive my second dose. I would be so grateful for any advice on how to proceed as I really want to get the second shot, but also am concerned if there is a risk that I could have a severe allergic reaction upon receiving it. I have searched the agency website and see where a second dose is not recommended for anyone that has had a severe or non-severe allergic reaction to the first dose. What I had was not severe, but I am unclear if it was enough to preclude me from receiving a second dose. I would so appreciate any insight, guidance, or connection to someone who can advise on how to proceed. Thank you.

                                                Started with lethargy and hot flashes, followed by extreme shortness of breath, difficulty speaking and holding up my head and keeping my eyes open. Then trembling. The local nurse at the vaccination sight reported high blood pressure, rapid pulse and seemingly extremely low blood sugar. I didn?t go to the ER because my supervisor agreed to take me home since we were volunteering at the sight prior to me receiving the vaccine. I had to keep eating every hour or so due to blood sugar seeming very low. Shortness of breath continued. Pulse rate still high as I could sleep with my head down due to racing pulse in my head. Later that night I had small bumps on my arms with no itch. Then I had extreme fatigue and muscle fatigue. I kept experiencing extreme episodes of hot flashes. I woke up in the middle of the night with a headache and uncomfortable hot flashes. I drank 100% juice and ate a few goldfish. I had mild nausea and food aversions. The next day the bumps were gone. I went to work but was sent home. I was told I should have gone to the ER but I don?t have insurance. Once home, I went through 5 hours of extreme chills unlike anything I have ever experienced. I had to cross my arms over my chest and stack on blankets to regulate. If I moved my arms for more than five minutes or pulled the blanket down, I began uncontrollably trembling. I still had trouble regulating my blood sugar on day two. It?s day three and no bumps and no chills. Less muscle fatigue as well. I am still pretty exhausted and tire easy when doing things. I did experience the common soreness in the muscle the vaccination was administered, but I figure that is normal.  I am hopeful that I am improving and out of the danger zone. I took Garden of Life Elderberry with added nutrients last night and today I took my normal detox probiotic. I have been pushing fluids and have broken my intermittent fasting to try and keep my blood sugar up. I feel like my system is finally regulating and now I just have lingering exhaustion from the events that took place.

Drinking water helped at first but about 20 mins after that I felt my throat get tight in the back. Went and received an epi shot. Paramedics took me to ER at the Hospital. In ER I received a a second epi shot about an hour after admission as tightness as starting again. Benadryl, prednisone and Pepcid was also given. I was admitted for observation for close to 28 hrs. Following morning I was given more prednisone and Benadryl. It?s been 3 weeks and I still have side effects with throat and tongue discomfort at night and when laying down. Awaiting results from follow up testing.

Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back.

                                                I first got a bad headache and dizzy. They brought me back behind a curtain with an emergency person. I got very dizzy and nauseous after that. They had me lay down on a cot. About 30 minutes after I received the vaccine, they brought me out to my husband?s vehicle in a wheelchair. By that time, I was so dizzy that I could hardly stand by myself. I was told to call my primary care doctor. My husband called them while we were headed home. My tongue was swollen a little. We decided to go to my father in law?s home, since he is a doctor. By the time we got there, I was coughing. We were still on hold for a nurse at my primary care doctor?s office. I started getting hives on my chest and neck and wheezing around the same time. We left before seeing my father in law to go home and use my nebulizer. For the moment, I used my inhaler, which doesn?t work as well. Once we got to my driveway, a nurse from my PCP office said to go straight to the emergency room. I spent the night at the hospital that night and was treated for an allergic reaction, which resolved the issues. I continued medications at home after leaving the hospital the following day.

As he was getting it she told him to call 911 and then her eyes rolled back in her head and she stopped breathing. Paramedics attempted to revive her but were unsuccessful. She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. Cause of death listed as heart disease.

A 37-year-old patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 around 5 pm (at 37-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraine. Concomitant medication included amitriptyline since 2018 at 10 mg nightly, 20 mg and 30 mg for migraine and stopped after COVID, and she was feeling tired/ sleepy and that made it worse; riboflavin sodium phosphate (VITAMIN B), and magnesium. The next day on 07Jan2021 about 7:59 am (around 13 hours after receiving the vaccine), all of a sudden she was driving and her jaw was paralyzed, it&#39;s became hard, she couldn&#39;t move it and it was very painful. she never had that and she was driving with her two little kids and it freaked her out and she tried to park and she finally parked being it lasted for a couple of minutes. When she looked at the time again it was 8:03 am, it was gone. She needed to get her kids to safety because she was driving but then it went away. On 09Jan2021, she started to have all of a sudden this tension on her neck that felt like a neck injury, it was hard to move her neck to a certain side and started while she was working. It was progressing and she thought she hurt herself. The pain began to lead to a severe headache. The neck pain felt like an injury lasted for a couple of days, but headache persisted and was intense, it lasted for 2 weeks and her coworkers thought she had COVID. She worked on 09Jan2021 and 10Jan2021 and then called out after that. On 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 the pain was not just in her head but in the left eye, it was throbbing and severe pain deep inside. It lasted for a couple of days lasted for over a week, it was not as bad as the first couple of days, the pain was the most severe on the 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and couldn&#39;t do anything and stayed in bed. It felt like it was nerve pain and she never had that before, it was definitely different. She took daily anti migraine medicine and as long as she took it she doesn&#39;t have migraine headaches. For her Sumatriptan 50 mg, she took it twice on 12Jan2021, but because of the side effects it makes her nauseous and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore, she just has the prescription. She was only allowed to have 10 a month. It is sumatriptan and it didn&#39;t work either and she was supposed to take it to reverse the headache and it didn&#39;t work. For the amitriptyline, its 10 mg and had to triple to 30 mg. She took it at nighttime, but one of the side effects is that it made her sleepy but she didn&#39;t sleep. She has a 3 month supply and had plenty, if she needed to adjust but that was her first time she was taking that much, her doctor said she could up her dose to 20 mg, her gave her permission before because it can be used at higher doses if needed, she did try the 20 mg but that did not work so she had to triple to 30 mg. Once she realized that was not helping she just said forget it. She had to triple the dose of her migraine medicine and she was taking 3000-4000 mg of paracetamol (TYLENOL) even that couldn&#39;t take it down and even did cold compresses. The headaches lasted for a couple of weeks and then she finally got COVID. The headache after that was different, not as intense, and even taking paracetamol a couple times per day was dealing with this headache, the fever the body aches. It is not like the headache she got from the vaccine. It lasted for another week with COVID and was different and managing the headache. So currently she was good. She stopped taking amitriptyline, she was taking it for 3 years and was switched to Vitamin B2 and magnesium in the last month and had no headaches. She had to switch after getting COVID because she felt more tired and sleepy and felt that the amitriptyline would make it worse so she had to find something else. She was good with the new medications. She was cleared to go back to work on 03Feb2021. She was pretty much good by 03Feb2021. She was told by her MD not to get a second dose but her employer stated she could be terminated if she was not fully vaccinated. She was concerned and scared of having this reaction again. Her arm pain hurt for a few hours but because she has other pain she thought it was her left arm but she really couldn&#39;t recall. she did have pain in her arm, it was normal pain nothing significant. It started at 11 pm on 06Jan2021 and lasted until Saturday 09Jan2021 and remembered that she had a hard time helping at work because she has to used the arm but the arm soreness was just like with any other vaccine, nothing abnormal. From 10Jan2021 to 13Jan2021 she kept feeling she like had something in her throat in the morning, and when she would start drinking she couldn&#39;t swallow like her body forgot how to do it. She would hold it in her mouth and then 30 seconds later she would start swallowing and then it went away. It was just in the morning for like 4 days. It cleared by 14Jan2021, clarifies it ended then. Caller stated her husband took a test on 11Jan2021 and didn&#39;t get his results until 14Jan2021 and showed he was positive and he was already isolating and she was at home with the kids. States her husband was the one that brought it in. She did start to have COVID symptoms until 23Jan2021, she had fever, chills, body ache, runny nose, shortness of breath and diarrhea. She was prescribed a z pack, azithromycin, and it helped with cough, the congestive cough and nasal spray for her runny nose. It was water coming out of her nose, most runny she has ever felt. She got testing and kept going for testing because she felt so sick and it was negative (on 13Jan2021 and 18Jan2021). She finally tested positive on 25Jan2021. No additional therapies for COVID-19.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in right arm on 26Dec2020 11:30 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was given at nurse&#39;s hospital vaccine clinic. Medical history included narcolepsy with cataplexy. Concomitant medication in two weeks included venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR SR), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took naproxen and erythromycin; and experienced drug allergy.  On 26Dec2020, the patient stated &#34;At about 1150 my tongue started to get a little bit of numbness and tingling. I didn&#39;t really feel nervous but I thought maybe some type of anxious reaction. So I thought I&#39;d give it just a little time and over the next 20 minutes the numbness and tingling progressed to the roof of my mouth, my gums, my lower lip, underneath my tongue, up my cheeks and up underneath my eyes on both sides. I was not feeling anxious about the vaccination. I didn&#39;t have any trouble breathing or difficulty swallowing. It felt like Novocain that was wearing off like after you have dental work done. I decided to take 25mg Benadryl to see if it went away. And it definitely got better about 25 minutes after I took the Benadryl. Within an hour I would say it was 95% gone. Still just like a trace numbness on my cheeks. When I woke up this morning (27Dec2020) I noticed the facial numbness had completely resolved.&#34; The adverse event start time also reported as 11:45 AM. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on 27Dec2020.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Over the next 20 minutes the numbness and tingling progressed to the roof of my mouth, my gums, my lower lip, underneath my tongue, up my cheeks, and underneath my eyes on both sides.  Because it kept slowly progressing I took 25 mg oral Benadryl. About 20 minutes after the Benadryl I noticed that my tongue didn?t feel or look as swollen.  Within an hour I would say 95% better.   I just had some trace numbness on my cheeks bilaterally.  Symptoms returned again about 12 hours later. Again took Benadryl, this time 50 mg. All symptoms have resolved

                                                left sided mild case of trigeminal neuritis that persisted beyond 48 hrs after vaccination given (symptom-numbness); headache; gritty/sandy sensation in mouth; borderline intermittent scratchy/sore throat, gritty/sandy sensation in mouth; borderline intermittent scratchy/sore throat; lost taste; burning/tingling on tongue; burning/tingling on tongue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient. A 38-year-old female patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot Number EK5730), intramuscular in the left arm on 28Dec2020 at 12:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for Covid-19 vaccination. edical history included trigeminal neuritis in the past twice, first from herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and second from flu shot a few years ago; acne and recurrent oral HSV 1, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was allergic to sulfa. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (LORYNA) for OCP; prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), short course completed prior to vaccination; beclometasone dipropionate (QNASL); xylometazonline hychrochloride (SUDAFED) which was stopped before vaccination; valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX); ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) which was stopped before vaccination and multivitamins. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 28Dec2020 at 12:45, the patient experienced left sided mild case of trigeminal neuritis that persisted beyond 48 hours with symptoms of numbness with decreased sensation on lateral part of V2 trigeminal nerve which started 10-15 mins after vaccination with small spot corner of mouth on left and involved lateral part of entire left side of face from corner of left eye down within 1-2 hours after received vaccine. The patient also experienced headache, borderline intermittent scratchy/sore throat, gritty/sandy sensation in mouth, at 12-14 hours after getting vaccine on 28Dec2020; got burning/tingling on tongue and then lost taste 100% for about 1 hour then started to slightly come back-and waxed and waned until later that evening and most was back to normal except sweet taste still gone. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken for all of the events which included antihistamines and valaciclovir; and for the trigeminal neuritis only, methylprednisolone pack. The clinical outcome of the event trigeminal neuritis was recovering (lasted longer than 48 hours after vaccination); for headache, stomatitis, throat irritation, oropharyngeal pain, ageusia, tongue discomfort and paraesthesia oral was recovered (at 48 hours after vaccination).

                                                About 15 minutes after the injection I felt a warm sensation throughout my body and it went away immediately. About 10  minutes after that, my throat started feeling scratchy/itchy/tingling, then my tongue and lips. After about 10 minutes it went away. I felt ok so I left the vaccination area and went back to my department I work in. For several hours the same symptoms came and went in waves, lessening over time. At 8:30pm the same day, I took 25 mg PO Benadryl to feel safe while sleeping. I felt fine the next day and reported it to the pharmacist in the vaccination clinic. I never felt like my airway was compromised.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

                                                I got the vaccine at 11am on 1/19/21 by 8pm of 1/19/21 I had a low grade temp and was tired so I went to bed. By 1am I woke up with uncontrollable shivering and had an alarming temperature of 104. I then took alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen and for the next 24 hours and I had a continuous fever for the entirety of 1/20/21 that would range from 101-103 with taking  the constant Tylenol and ibuprofen.  In addition I had shooting nerve pain down my legs, I was so weak I felt like I could not move, terrible body aches, and had what felt like dizziness and blurred vision at the same time. By 1/21/21 I started to improve but still had an increased temp of 99 and body aches but not as bad as the day prior. I am a healthy 38 year old with a good BMI no medical history and am very concerned about the temperature of 103-104 in regards to those with underlying heart or health conditions which may not be able to withstand that high of a temperature or a continuous temperature like I had for an extended period of time . I would have gone to the emergency room but I am a healthcare professional with the education and experience to know what to do in this situation

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

Wasn&#39;t any better and lost my taste and smell for 3 days. Went to the Clinic, was tested for Covid-19 and the flu both negative. Went back to the Clinic and had chest x-ray, diagnosed with right middle lobe pneumonia.  Sent home with doxycycline and zofran. Took the Medication as directed. Still feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and still winded and extremely tired after doing the slightest bit of house work, whether it would be sweeping the floor, doing dishes, or laundry. I get extremely after doing one activity. I still have not driven.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported a 38-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176) via unspecified route single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 08Jan2021, 10 am, at 38-year-old. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included: celecoxib (CELEXA) 10 mg for an anti-depressant; alprazolam (XANAX) 0.25mg three times a day. Once the patient took that second vaccine, she had the metallic taste and had some headache and migraine at that time (08Jan2021). When the patient got the vaccine, within one minute, she started getting her usual migraine on the right side of head (08Jan2021), that was pretty much instantly. She didn&#39;t have an appetite (Jan2021), she only vomited when she ate. She had nausea and vomiting, it was about 2 o&#39;clock that afternoon (08Jan2021, 2 pm). Every time she ate, she vomited and lost taste, lost the sense of taste. The patient was still nauseated (Hence, ongoing checked for nausea) and she hadn&#39;t tasted anything. She hadn&#39;t drink or ate anything yet this morning but last night her taste was starting to come back. But she still couldn&#39;t identify something. No treatment received. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the event nausea was not resolved, outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported experiencing throat swelling, face and lip tingling. Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

I had some itching and swelling at the injection site but the bullseye showed up later. The infectious disease team did not seem to find I needed any additional treatment. I self medicated myself with Tylenol, Benadryl Zyrtec OTC and Ibuprofen. There was about 4-5 days before the second dose when the symptoms cleared up.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL8982), intramuscular in the left arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. The patient was allergic to penicillin. The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 28Dec2020 in the left arm. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ALERTEC), both for unknown indication from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 18Jan2021 at 11:00, the patient experienced bad cough, trouble breathing, tingling around mouth, numbness in jaw and neck, shaking, red face and chest, and slight itching. Treatment was given when seen by paramedics with an emergency room visit which included a second dose of allergy medication. The clinical outcome of the events bad cough, trouble breathing, tingling around mouth, numbness in jaw and neck, shaking, red face and chest, and slight itching was recovering. It was reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), considering the plausible temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

It sounded like I was hearing a lot of echoing/tinny sound in my ears every time someone was talking; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient). A 38-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 14Jan2021 at 5:00PM at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 38-year-old. Lot number was EL3249. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Dec2020 at 1:00PM at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (lot number was EL1284) at the age of 38-year-old. About 26 hours after 2nd dose of vaccine on 22Jan2021 at 7:00PM, the patient experienced sudden onset of tinnitis mostly in right ear, but both ears were affected.  It sounded like the patient was hearing a lot of echoing/ tinny sound in ears every time someone was talking.  It only lasted a few hours and hearing returned to normal, but the patient had never experienced anything like that before, and it was so close to the vaccine administration, that she had to wonder if there was a correlation. The patient was not treated for the event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the event. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                tunnel vision; Muscle fatigue; joint pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) communicated to a Pfizer colleague. A 38-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received her first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 04Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was None.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 04Jan2021 the patient experienced tunnel vision, muscle fatigue, joint pain. No treatment was received for the events.  The outcome of the events was not resolved.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of tunnel vision cannot be excluded.

Started out slowly late morning around 9am and got worse by the afternoon.  Took Motrin to relieve symptoms and slept.  The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

                                                With the second dose my symptoms started late evening on 01/13/2021. I started feeling bad, but finished my shift. Felt drained, headache to start. By next morning (01/14) I had fever (101.5F) and the whose body aches, nausea, diarrhea, horrible horrible headache, like a migraine, severe congestion, runny nose and some days later I started having an earache on my right ear. I would like to mention I also had a vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor that started with the first dose and had not resolved by the time I received the second dose and this time the odor is much stronger, it is awful, I already made an appt with my GYN. The odor got much stronger about a week after the second dose. I kept self medicating at home with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, but the fever would return as soon as the dose was weaning off. The 101.5F fever lasted for about 9 days.  I also experienced shortness of breath from 01/14 until the 22nd and I never had to use my rescue inhaler before. I had to use it and had to even call for a second one. I am very athletic and active and never need it even after my runs and workout activities. I consulted with my PCP on the 19th and again she gave me a covid test. Negative. She diagnosed me with inner ear infection (right ear). Prescribed me Levaquin and in 2 days I was much better. On the 22nd I finally started seeing the symptoms subside and started feeling better.  Also, I wanted to tell that I had a gas pain episode that almost sent me to the ER. My chest, my left shoulder hurt really really bad. I called a friend who is a physician and he told me to take some gasex first and if that did not work to go to the ER. Fortunately it worked. But the pain was excruciating.

                                                The night of the side effects were normal, over all fatigue.  The next day my top, left upper lip started to go numb and swell, because of the timeline of the event and the lack of any other symptom I was not thinking allergic reaction, but took a benedryl just in case.  I feel asleep and woke up a couple hour later and the top upper lip swelling had started to go down, but my bottom lip had swollen and looked like a sausage.  At this point it was pretty late at night and figured the ER had bigger problems to deal with and this was either going to be better by morning or worse and would deal with it then.  When I woke up the next day I had some submental pain, but the swelling in my lip had gone down considerable.  At this point I noticed I had considerable pain in my collar bone, I felt the area, noticed a mass, went to the mirror and saw what looked like a golf ball under my skin at my collar bone.  My lymph nodes were completely swollen.  I went to urgent care who instructed me to follow up with my PCP if it didn&#39;t go down in a week, my PCP told me we would follow up with an ultrasound if it didn&#39;t go down in a month.  At this point this is getting ridiculous.  I understand that swollen lymph nodes are a side effect, but it should not be for a month.  This is causing me discomfort and gets worse the more I move around and on top of that I have been getting numbness in my left arm and hand which is what side the swollen lymph node is on.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine  Pt received first dose of vaccine in December and states that she only had a sore arm. She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the vaccine I started to have a headache that would go from the base of head on the right side, up the right side of my head to the back of my right eye. This lasted for 5 days. I had tried tylenol, ibuprofen, and advil with no relief. On day 4 I woke up with and additional symptom of nausea. I went to Urgent care where they tested me for Covid which came back negative and suggested this was side effects from the vaccine. The nausea lasted until the 7th day post vaccine.

                                                Patient presented for her first dose of Pfizer covid-19 vaccination today. She had Covid in the fall.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to antibiotics in the past, was advised she should be evaluated for 30 minutes post vaccination today. She agreed, was seated in the front row of chairs, next to the EMS and RN Observer tables.  This RN checked in frequently with patient throughout her 30 minute observation period, conversing throughout the wait time. She reported feeling anxious about the vaccine and potential for side effects. She had her husband drive her to her appointment today. Her earlobes and forehead were flushed red and dry, but her neck was without redness. She had even, regular respirations and was able to speak clearly without issue.  RN reassured her that we were here, assessing for any changes and were available to help.  After 15 minutes, patient stated her mouth felt dry. RN offered water, patient accepted. She was able to drink and swallow without trouble. Patient&#39;s coloring remained the same, but she reported feeling better. She was still able to converse without difficulty.  At about 29 minutes, patient stated she was worried that something may happen after her 30 minutes was up, stated her tongue was starting to feeling thick. RN offered her additional observation with EMS, alerted them to the situation. Patient checked out with RN station and this RN walked her into the hallway for EMS evaluation.  EMS helped patient out of her sweatshirt and mask.  EMS noted lip swelling and increased redness in her face, neck, chest, earlobes.  EMS obtained vitals and administered 50 mg benadryl IM in her right deltoid.  Patient&#39;s husband came in from the parking lot. Patient declined solumedrol injection due to her diabetes.  EMS advised patient she needed additional evaluation and she was transported to hospital via ambulance.  Patient&#39;s husband followed in his car.  VAERS report filed.

                                                Immediately felt dizzy/woozy. Within 1 minute felt extremely hot and a bright red, splotchy rash appeared all over my chest, neck, face, back. Jaw and tongue felt tingly, but not unsure if that meant swollen. Medic checked heart rate and BP which were elevated. HR was in 120&#39;s and BP was 140&#39;s/80&#39;s for a prolonged period of time. Doctor gave Benadryl which seemed to help. Doctor and Medic watched me for an hour. Rash mostly went away within 5 hours, however once I came home, I noticed it had also been on my legs.  The rash never produced hives, but the Doctor onsite confirmed this was an immediate allergic reaction, and said to see my regular doctor and an allergist. Since the shot some flushed look has come back in spots each day for a short period of time (maybe 10 mins or so). Still taking Claritin.

                                                Pt received her vaccination around 11.58am and advised to stay for observation by RPh for 30minutes due to history of her throat closing up due to Aleve allergy years ago. Patient started reporting fast heartbeat about 10minutes after and we concluded that it might be because she was anxious and continued to observe pt. However, she started feeling foggy, tongue felt numb, and throat started to hurt as well. Pt was not able to clarify whether her throat was closing up. Due RPh professional  judgement, she gave pt EpiPen 0.3mg injection on Left thigh considering pt history and called paramedics. Pt was seen by paramedics at the pharmacy and brought to ER/urgent care for treatment. Called patient several hours after, and she is currently fine at home.

                                                Upper lip swelling day after my second vaccine that is painful and significant. Swelling has not resolved with Benadryl that was suggested and remains significantly swollen and inflamed.  Right side of upper lip started swelling first and then it slowly spread to the left side of the upper lip. Bottom lip not impacted. No other signs of respiratory distress or rash. I did spike a fever exceeding 103.6 after the vaccine and had aches/chills/nausea/headache but these were all expected. The lip swelling has been the outlier.

                                                (note: I had no reaction to the first dose)  13 hours after receiving my second dose I had been in bed for a couple of hours unable to get comfortable because I felt weird. That?s when my ankles and feet began to itch. I checked for mosquito bites, none were there but I noticed that my ankles and feet were swollen. I applied a lotion recommended eczema  thinking my skin might be dry. Over the next hour the itching got worse and spread up my calves. That?s when I noticed that my tongue felt weird and kinda poofy. I?m used to occasional dry mouth due to my meds, but this was nothing like that. It freaked me out so I got up took Allegra hoping that on top of the Zyrtec I?d taken hours before would help. Since I was restless and desperately needed sleep  I took 1/2 of a 15mg trazadone tablet. That did the trip. No itching and I was able to sleep. Now I?ve been in bed all day with flu-like symptoms, I?m miserable and I?ve missed work. Unless I awake tomorrow morning feeling magically better I?ll miss work again.  The itching and swollen tongue  really freaked me out, hence my report today.

Went to sleep. Awakened dry heaving &amp; had vomited some bile. Couldn?t stand or walk due to extreme dizziness &amp; moderate nausea continued. Called PCP and was seen at 1pm on march 26th. My son had to help me walk all day so far. The doctor office checked my vitals &amp; my ears. Vitals good. No infection. Diagnosed with vertigo &amp; prescribed Meclizine. 4p was 1st dose. Seems to be helping some. Nausea has subsided. Buzzing is present, but quieter. Still too dizzy to walk without assistance

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the shot I got a slight taste and a sensation in the back of my nose. Within an hour it moved a little lower to listen station in the back of my throat. Almost a sensation like before you would throw up but not the same. Soon after developed nausea which lasted and intensified until bed around 10pm. A sore arm that eve, but not major. Woke up feeling pretty well with just a sore arm. Developed chills and mild fever which persisted rest of that day and following day. Fever mostly around 100-100.4. Got up t0 100.6. Ear  thermometer registered 101 at one point but shortly after jumped down so it seemed unreliable. On day 4 fever subsided and felt normal.  On day 5, sensation in back of throat and nausea returned. No fever.

Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

Went back to bed and took my temp an hour later was 101.0.   Had body aches, chills, thirst, weakness, headache for the rest of the day.  Temperature went from 99.0 to the highest of 102.0.  Got ahold of covid 19 hotline at work, they said it was a reaction to the shot and should be gone within 72hrs.  If not then I would need to get covid tested.  Got ahold of my pcp and they ordered a covid test but I told them what the hotline had said and that I would wait to get one done.  It has been 24 hour since and now I no longer have a fever and am feeling better just tired.

                                                4 days after receiving vaccine, was awoken from sleep with high pitched tinnitus in right ear.  I discovered in the morning that i could not hear out of that ear.    My husband, a physician, examined ears and did not see any effusion.  Consulted with a friend who is an ENT specialist, and he recommend initiating high dose steroids immediately.  2 days later, had audiology test in ENT office, and it revealed severe Sensiorneural hearing loss in right ear.  The steroids were continued, and valtrex was added.  I had MRI of head on  1/7/20 which did not reveal any abnormality.

I could feel a tingle in my mouth at the same time.  I became panicked of course but the flushing quickly subsided.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.

Went to the ER on the 12/21/20-12/22/20 due to increase headache, vomiting, diarrhea, dizzy, dry cough, weak/extremely fatigue. At the ER was given IV fluid, Zofran, Phenergan, tested for the Flu and Covid, also had blood work. All my blood work came back in normal ranges, FLU and Covid test were negative as well. Discharged from the ER with Phenergan, the next 3 days I had a migraine and had to be in a dark room with lights off, still very dizzy, tired, shortness of breath with movement, could not eat it made me nauseas.

                                                Metalic taste feeling of numbness in face with itching started within 25 min. I self medicated with 25mg of Benadryl 15 min before injection because I had the same reaction to the first injection. However it did not prevent the reaction as I hoped it would this time. 30 min post injection I took another 25mg of Benadryl. Once med started working symptoms went away.  At no time did I have difficulty breathing. By midnight I was woken by chills, body aches, and head ache (possibly secondary to the jaw clenching I woke up with too). I took tylenol which did not appear to help which is abnormal for me. Fever, chills, aches continued on throughout the night and through the day into the night. On tylenol fever was noted to be 100.6 Fahrenheit. I was finally able to sleep with tylenol and motrin by 10 pm on 18th for 8 hours. Next day temp was about 97.6 Fahrenheit with mild sweating throughout the day and aches had subsided. Today Jan. 19th all symptoms are gone.

                                                Hearing loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse Anesthetist (patient).  A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0140) on 18Dec2020 at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.Medical history included ongoing anaemia. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021 at 16:00 the patient experienced hearing loss, serious as medically significant. Patient had no problems with her ears before hand. On 06Jan2021 around 4 PM, she was just walking in the store, with no loud music or anything, and all of a sudden her hearing in her left ear went lost and muffled. On 07Jan2021 she went to the Otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) to get her ears checked. They said no it looked perfectly fine. They did an audiogram and hearing test on 07Jan2021 and there was a 20% hearing loss. She had no idea what it was from. She took no other medications. She had anemia but that was it. She was wondering if hearing loss has been reported with the vaccine either in the studies or recently. She researched it, and with the COVID virus itself, back in Jul2020 and Oct2020, people reported hearing loss. So she went and had a COVID test in Jan2021 and it was negative. Patient stated it was very scary and weird. Event treatment included high dose oral steroids to see if it can be treated and the ENT doctor was also giving her steroid shots in the ear. She was due to see him again in Jan2021. The outcome of the event Hearing loss was not recovered.  Patient also clarified that she did continue with her second dose of the vaccine on 08Jan2021. She had asked the ENT doctor his opinions on still getting the second dose, and he recommended it.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

Under my nose was numb, felt like I had novacaine. 1 hour and 30 minutes later my throat swelled. I had a hard time getting water down my throat. I took two benadryl pills at 11:10 am. Throat swelling went away within 10 minutes of taking benadryl and I was able to eat without any issues. My lips are still tingling, it&#39;s been 7 hours since the injection.

                                                Ringing in ears; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Dec2020 16:00 (first dose, lot number: EJ1685, expire: unknown) at single dose, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 08Jan2021 09:00 (second dose, lot number: EL3246, expire: Apr2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included very frequent yeast infections that started about eight years ago, hypothyroidism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she has been on medication her whole life). Concomitant medication included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) at 90 mg daily for hyperthyroidism (she has been on this particular medication about a year, but she has been on thyroid medication her whole life). The patient experienced ringing in ears on an unspecified date. She got two doses of Pfizer vaccine. It may be a coincidence. She started having intermittent ringing in ears and now it had been constant for 3 or 4 days in a row. She had continuous ringing in her ear and has never had problems with her ears before. It wasn&#39;t going away. She was at the point to go to the doctor. She honestly didn&#39;t know the date. She noticed it intermittently about the time she got the COVID vaccine. She didn&#39;t really pay much attention. She got the second shot about the time it started constantly. She couldn&#39;t say 100%, maybe it was coincidental. Caller clarified that she noticed intermittent ringing in the ears about the same time of the first dose. She noticed constant ringing about the same time as the second dose. She would rate seriousness criteria at a five, in the middle. It is not requiring hospitalization, but she would seek medical treatment if it didn&#39;t go away. The outcome of event was not resolved. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events were not required a visit to emergency room nor physician office at this time, but she was considering seeing her doctor or an ENT. No AE following prior vaccinations. No relevant tests.

I received the shot on a Wednesday afternoon and by Saturday I felt like I could claw my eye out, that I had something in it.  I went to the eye doctor Monday morning and was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer.  After the second COVID19 shot I was watched for 30 minutes based on my first reaction.  I again turned very red and very hot.  I had hives on my arms, neck, and behind my ears.  I felt lightheaded and dizzy.  I received 25 mg Benadryl by mouth and was observed for another 45 minutes.  At that time I walked outside and felt worse.  My throat became very itchy and I kept coughing.  I went back in to tell provider and received an epi pen injection into my right leg, they took my vitals, and sent me to the hospital by ambulance.

That night I went to drink and liquid came out my mouth spontaneously,  my left side of face had lost normal wrinkles on forehead, eyebrow wouldn&#39;t lift, eyelid wouldn&#39;t blink, cheek couldn&#39;t puff, lips didn&#39;t smile. Next day (1) slight cheek numbness noted- resolved Day3 . Day 2 slight difficulty articulating words. Night 3 intermittent sharp outer ear and mastoid area pain duration 30min and at different times intermittent pulsatile heartbeat and whistling sound 10 min or less.  Day 4 &amp; 6 notable improvements in cheek ability to puff- not fully resolved though. Day 5 eyelid movement - not fully resolved though.  Day 6: less difficulty articulating. Day 1: Spoke to OB office nurse- offered steroids which I declined &amp; spoke to PCP recommended go to ED, which I declined, I&#39;m a family physician and had otherwise normal Cranial nerve testing and no other neurological changes- seems fully consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy.  Day 3 had co-worker physician use otoscope - normal exam bilaterally.

                                                I received COVID vaccine #1 on 6 Jan 21.  Shortly following the vaccine I turned very red and felt very hot.  The next few days I experienced a very bad headache and flu like symptoms.  On 9 Jan 21 my left eye felt very irritated and had redness.  I was seen by optometry on 11 Jan 21 and was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer.    I received COVID vaccine #2 on 27 Jan 21.  I was observed for 30 minutes based on the first vaccine experience.  I got very flushed, red, and hot and very itchy.  I felt lightheaded and not right.  I had hives behind my ears and on my chest.  I notified one of the vaccine staff who gave me 25mg Benadryl by mouth and took my vitals.  The staff observed me for another 45 minutes.  Once I went outside the back of my throat felt very itchy.  I felt like I had something in my throat and I had to keep trying to clear my throat.  I got very red, hot, and itchy again.  I went back inside to tell the staff.  They gave me an epi pen injection into my right thigh and called the ambulance.  I was taken to the ER to be evaluated.  Two days later I noticed the back of my throat was very red and my uvula was large and elongated.  I called the clinic and was given cough drops and Cepacol.  I have been experiencing hives, redness, and feeling very itchy.  To a point I have been having to take Benadryl.  I took the 5 days of steroids and ended them on Monday.  Yesterday, 2 Feb 21 I woke up and my right eye was bloodshot, irritated, and uncomfortable.  I was seen at Urgent Care and prescribed Ofloxacin 4x a day for 10 days.  They did not notice any scratches or anything.  My right eye is still uncomfortable and red.  I am currently on day two of the eye drops.

I sat and was observed til approx. 1715 at which time I thought I was ready to head back to my department. After the elevator to the LL I really wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ended up going to the ER which they diagnosed me with Vertigo. I have never had vertigo in the past. I remained in the ER until approx. 2220 until my symptoms were managed with medication and I felt well enough to leave.The lightheaded and dizziness lasted a few days while the headaches lasted about a week.

The swelling and tingling dissipated after about 4 hours, and I took some 20mg PO Pepcid and 10mg Loratidine to see if it would help.  After 6-8 hours the swelling and tingling to my tongue was gone. I reported this to my provider Manaku MD, and she recommended it was fine to get my second vaccine, and she would give me a methylprednisone taper pack for the next vaccine. She states she questions if I have an allergy to polyethylene glycol which I did not believe I did? Unsure of where the reaction could have stemmed from.

Dizziness. Seeing stars when moving, and  rapid heart beat that would not stop and my chest began hurting.  Dr saw me in the Ed where I was administered iv bolus fluids along with the meds: toradol, dexamethasone, pepsid, Benadryl, and zofran.  I went home and laid on the couch all evening until the chest pain became so intense I went to new medical center emergency department. I was then given iv fluids along with phenergan, toradol, dilaudid, and Ativan. I got a chest X-ray, ecg, ekg, and a bunch of blood work to rule out things.

                                                I had a migraine beginning Feb 9 AM. I have chronic migraines that almost always occur on the left side of my head, but this one was on the right side, which is unusual for me. The migraine pain was more severe than normal. I also had a stiff right jaw and eye pain primarily on the right side. I took 100 mg Imitrex in the afternoon of Feb 9 and it reduced the pain very effectively (which is also unusual for me). On Feb 10 AM, the migraine returned or a new one started. The pain was also in the right side. I took 100 mg Imitrex and it reduced the pain somewhat effectively.  The migraine pain returned Feb 11 AM and hurt on both sides of my head. I took 100 mg Imitrex this evening (Feb 11) and it is helping so far. In addition, my left arm was sore around the injection site beginning when I got the shot and stopped this morning.

                                                On third day after 2nd vaccine was given, urticaria  appeared throughout my body, along with tongue swelling, wheezing, flushing, and eye irritation. Because my daughter suffers from allergic reactions, I knew to immediately administer Benadryl. I also took an additional dose of Zyrtec and Pepcid, which helped temporarily and symptoms subsided when I called my primary care doctor. I had a virtual visit,  and she then prescribed Medrol.

I look like I&#39;ve been punched in the face.  The first time, it lasted about 4-5 days before it went away. My vaccine date for dose #1 was Friday 1/29/21 and the swelling started on 2/5 (the following Friday). My second vaccine date was Monday 2/22 and the skin beneath the eye started reacting 3/2 (Tuesday). It itches a huge amount. The skin beneath the eye is dark red, and puffy. The skin beneath the left eye is normal.

                                                On March 3, 2021, a eligible vaccine recipient, patient, received her first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine at approximately 9:00am.  After a 15 minute observation period, patient was driving home at approximately 9:20am when she began to feel tingling and numbness in her mouth and tightening of the throat.  Patient returned to clinic and informed clinic staff she was having a reaction to the vaccine.  A cardiologist volunteering in the post-immunization observation met with the patient and evaluated her.  The cardiologist was informed by patient that she had a history of allergic reactions to vaccines and carries an EpiPen, but had not used it yet.  Patient&#39;s vitals were normal. She was given diphenhydramine for her symptoms, which did not improve.  The Emergency Department was consulted, who advised that patient should be transported to the ED and monitored for 4 hours.  The cardiologist transported patient to ED via wheelchair.  The following day, patient reported she was released from the ED after 4 hours of observation.  All of the symptoms had subsided at the time of release from the ED, and she was back to baseline on 3/4/21.    The patient was referred to an allergist for consultation and clearance prior to receiving a second dose of Pfizer vaccine. Also of note, upon review of the patient&#39;s vaccine consent form, she did not acknowledge that she had previous anaphylactic reactions to other vaccines, nor was this information relayed to the vaccinator who administered the vaccine.  Upon return to clinic, the patient reported she was 5-6 weeks pregnant.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

My usual comfortable watch felt tight and annoying.   Was able to walk to observation area,  then started getting dizzy and light- headed.  Still had warm,  tingly feeling in arm that received injection.  My normal resting heart rate is 61 but now it was up to 111 per smart watch (possibly 121 but can&#39;t confirm since I was dizzy and blurry-eyed). In addition to tingly arm,  racing heart,  dizziness,  I felt immediate fatigue and wanted to lay down and sleep. Also,  had dull headache on left-side.  Nurse sat me down and elevated my feet. Also got me some frozen peas for my forehead and neck.  After 12-13 mintues,  I started feeling better.  She kept me under observation for full hour.  Got better and went home.  Heart rate remained elevated at 78-89 rest of evening.  Dull headache remained on left- side only. Similar feeling to when wearing a tight pony tail and you take it out.

                                                The vision in my right was blurred for about 6 hours. When it started to get better it was inconsistent.  I would close my left eye and at first my right eye would be blurry for about 2-3 seconds then would be able to focus. As of now 13 hours after first noticing the problem upon waking, my vision is almost 20/20 again from what I can tell not having a doctors visit.

                                                About 45 minutes post vaccine my chest, neck, and face started to turn bright red and I had a horrible burning sensation as well as a scratchy throat.  I went to a walk in minor care clinic and they gave me a steroid shot.  The following day around 11:00 am the reaction spiked again and I went to the ER.  While at the ER they gave me more steroids, benadryl, and pepcid and observed the reaction for a couple hours.  The redness got better and the burning subsided but my skin was still a pinkish tone.  Today, the third day, I have a tingling feeling in my skin where the reactions occurred and they are bright pink.  I am on oral steroids and pepcid for a week.

Advised to go to emergency after been checked out by allergist on site. At emergency, was given Pepcid, steroids, IV fluids, Benadryl intravenously. Also, did bloodwork and chest X-ray. After bloodwork came back, doctor felt okay to release me. Over the week, still felt heavy chested and I could not return to work until a week later. The emergency doctor, sent me home with steroids, Pepcid, and Benadryl to take for the next 3 days. I only took the steroids and Pepcid because the Benadryl made me feel so out of it. I also started to get fatigued couple days after with some body aches. On Saturday morning,  I woke up at 4:00 am to vomit. Had an appointment with my PCP that Monday, told me to take Claritin and Albuetrol inhaler.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Mar2021 08:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cystitis interstitial and allergies: cat and bee stings. Concomitant medications included prednisone epinephrine, and chlorphenamine maleate (ANTIHISTAMIN) taken. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. After about 30 minutes, on 20Mar2021 09:00 AM, the patient experienced tongue started swelling and would not subside. She tried antihistamine all day with no success. She went to Urgent Care and received steroid shot and was prescribed prednisone that same evening. She was told to return if symptoms not improved in three days. The patient returned on Monday evening and was sent to the ER. She was diagnosed with Angioedema and given more antihistamines and steroid shot and epinephrine in IV. The patient was currently monitoring and seeing an allergist to follow up. Her tongue was still not back to normal. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of tongue started swelling and would not subside was not recovered, and of angioedema was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient had not been been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. No follow-up attempts are possible; information on the batch/lot number cannot be obtained.

                                                Itchiness all over her body; Weird taste in her mouth; dizzy; The initial safety information received was reporting only non-serious adverse drug reactions. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 12Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8735) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left deltoid on 31Mar2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Family medical history included that her dad has severe allergies. There were no concomitant medications. On 31Mar2021, after 1st dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, she experienced weird taste in mouth and felt little dizzy both went away immediately, not too concerned. Saturday 03Apr2021 until Saturday 10Apr2021, had itchiness all over her body, she was asking since she had a mild reaction, when she goes next week, if it will be really bad. It was really bad itching, she didn&#39;t think it would go away. Patient thought she had a reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, it was not deadly. She was trying to figure out if it was safe to her to get the second dose of the covid vaccine next week. Itchiness all over her body: The only place she did not itch was her hands and feet. Her scalp, back and everything itched. She mostly itched on her torso and scalp. She even itched inside of her ears. She does not take any medications. She was healthy. She has no known drug allergies. She has not started any new products. She kept going about her business, but the itching was getting worse and worse until this weekend. Last Wednesday, 07Apr2021, the itching was so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She does not like to take medications. She also used calamine lotion. She took Benadryl children&#39;s dose and it did not help the itching. She thinks that the dose was 10mg, but she does not know for sure. It was a new package, she had just bought it. Benadryl children&#39;s dose did not help at all. All of a sudden, the itching resolved on Saturday, 10Apr2021. She was out a lot in the sun all day Saturday. The sun seemed to help, she does not know if it was related. She did not have any hives. It felt like chicken pox to her but with no pustules. The itchiness all over her body was awful. She does not know. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. Her concern was if she had a mild reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, what was going to be like whenever she goes next week for her second dose of the covid vaccine. She was asking if it will be really bad. She was itching so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She took Benadryl children&#39;s dose and it did not help the itching. Event itching was reported as serious, medically significant. After reviewing call recording, patient reported when she was at the vaccine facility nothing really major happened, she had a little bit of a weird taste in her mouth, nothing strange. She did get a little bit dizzy but nothing that did not wear off shortly thereafter, so she went about her life normally. The weird taste and dizzy feeling started within minutes of receiving the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. She was lucky enough to work with doctors, so she just talked to them. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the event itchiness all over her body was recovered on 10Apr2021, while the other events recovered on 31Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported pruritus cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

A 39-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN16208) at the age of 39-years-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant. Medical history included Hormonal Acne, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included spironolactone taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium alginate (PEPCID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took cefalexin monohydrate (KEFLEX) and experienced allergy. The patient initially had some intermittent numbness/tingling of her inner upper lip that began within the first hour of receiving the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and lasted about 24 hours. Six days following vaccination on 25Mar2021, the patient began having muscle cramps/muscle soreness in her lower extremities that progressed to her upper extremities and neck, By the eighth day on 27Mar2021, she had developed numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet. On this day, she also began having muscle weakness and was unable to walk unassisted by the end of the day. She was seen in the Emergency room (ER), admitted, and transferred to another facility. The patient hospitalized for 1 day. She underwent a Computerised tomogram (CT) scan of my head, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of my brain/neck, lumbar puncture, and extensive blood work. All of her work up was unremarkable except for showing that she had a Vitamin D deficiency. Her symptoms began to improve without treatment in the hospital, and she was discharged home with the diagnosis that she had most likely had an unusual, adverse reaction to her 1st dose of the COVID 19 vaccine and was instructed not to receive my 2nd dose. Covid tested post vaccination (Nasal swab) on 28Mar2021: Negative. The outcome of the events &#39;numbness/tingling of my inner upper lip&#39; was recovered on 20Mar2021 and the outcome of the other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported Myalgia, Muscle cramps, Hypoasthesia, Parasthesia, Pheripheral swelling, Muscle weakness and Vitamin D Defiency.
