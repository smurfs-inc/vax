A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in 18Jan2021 at 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explained that she had a reaction to the vaccine. She had the vaccine yesterday (18Jan2021) about 03:30 in the afternoon and by the time she got home, within the hour, her lips tingled and she felt funny, and her eye lids tender. There was no one to call by that time and she did not think it was severe enough to go to the ER so she just took a Benadryl and went to bed. The patient woke up and her face was swollen more than before (onset reported as Jan2021). She doesn&#39;t think she is at the stage of life threatening, she can still breath, but doesn&#39;t know what to do at this point. Should she take more Benadryl or contact her healthcare provider. The patient asked if this makes her ineligible for the second dose. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 29Jan2021 14:00 at a single dose to prevent getting COVID-19. Medical history included cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis, medications for her heart, and medication for her stomach. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for high blood pressure and atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient has been on amlodipine in a good while, 7-8 years and atorvastatin for 5 years. The patient had the COVID shot on Friday, 29Jan2021 at 14:00, and about 4 hours afterward, she had a bad experience. She became very nauseated and lost her sight for 5 minutes. Everything was grey. She was wondering if there is anything she can take afterward. She was scheduled for her next one on 19Feb2021. She was wondering if she will experience the same thing. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. After getting the vaccine, she was on her way back. She began to feel very nauseated in the car. Then, all the sudden she wanted to throw up, but couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t hear her niece or say anything to her. She clarified she could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away. She couldn&#39;t respond. She rolled the window down to get air in her face. She hadn&#39;t eaten. In about 25-30 minutes got better. Since then, she hasn&#39;t been eating like she should, so she was still a little nauseated. It has improved though. She got the vaccine in her left arm.  Her right arm is mostly metal. She decided to get it because she is over 70 and wanted to prevent getting COVID-19. It was also reported that she was also on an arthritis medication, medications for her heart and a medication for her stomach. She has had no problems with those medications though. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: lost on an unspecified date. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. The outcome of the events &#34;lost eye sight for 5 minutes, everything was grey&#34;, &#34;could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away&#34; and &#34;very nauseated/wanted to throw up but couldn&#39;t&#34; was recovered on 29Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.

When I got to my doctor my blood pressure was elevated, it was about 180/88. My blood pressure is never that high. It did go down before I left to 140/84. When we were walking in the elevator after leaving the appointment my gait was unsteady. I felt very weak. I also light headed, and dizzy.  It felt like the feeling of the sedation you have receive  before having surgery. When we made it home I couldn&#39;t even see straight.  This lasted about 2 hours. I feel much better today.

                                                Patient was here for her 2nd dose vaccine and during her wait time her tongue started to feel funny and swell slightly. Staff was notified as they were talking with her that  her voice sounded a little funny and thick. She also started to cough on a regular interval. As staff continued talking with her she stated her throat started to feel funny and tight. Staff notified other healthcare personal and moved her to the private  treatment area. She continued to complain of thick tongue and continued to speak different then her baseline. We elected to give 50 mg Benadryl IM. She was also placed on the ECG showing sinus rhythm with O2 stats of 100 % and her blood pressure was 149/61, After the Benadryl, she stated she started to fell somewhat better. After about 10 minutes her tongue started to swell again and when she turned her head to speak to a staff member her airway shut off due to swelling. Staff quickly turned her head back to forward she was able to breath again.  She advised that she needed to be transported and was going to get 0.3 epi IM in her left arm. She did state prior to Epi being given she was now also having trouble focusing visually. Dr arrive to assess her and agreed that she needed transported. EMS arrived and care was turned over to Huntertown EMS to transport the patient to Medical Center.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This 76-year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL8982, expiry date; May2021), NDC number, UPC number; unknown, covid19 vaccine manufacturer; unspecified intramuscular from 28Jan2021 to 28Jan2021 at single dose on deltoid left (left upper shoulder) for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history included ongoing antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus (Patient medical continuing: Yes, diagnosed around 19 years old), surgery on her feet on 04Dec2020, blood thinner. Concomitant medications included Warfarin (tablet), strength; 6 mg orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date ongoing at 3 mg (6mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week) and then at 3 mg (3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week) for blood thinner. Laboratory test included INR (International normalised ratio) done on 04Feb2021 with result as (4.9; it is very high). Additional Information for concomitant products Warfarin: Her dose varies, new chart as of todays visit states to take 6mg on Sunday, 6mg on Monday 3mg on Tuesday, 6mg on Wednesday, 3mg on Thursday, 6mg on Friday, and 3mg on Saturday. Patient reported that INR should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. Consumer stated, &#34;I have been hold for almost for 2 hours because what happens I left my number as requested for call back. I got a call back in another 2 minutes. When I press to receive a call it disconnected. So I had to start all over again. So it is been like 2 hours adventure. Firstly I need to say that someone I told to call a second number well disconnect me twice but I have something call a report number that the person I think it has same job title of you. I am not certain but her name is (Name) and she gave me report number. She asked me all the questions, I answered all the her questions including my 28Jan2021 Pfizer injection which was my first injection and I have question referring to my taking Warfarin and wanted to if there was interaction because I went to doctor today to see my blood was instead 2.5 to 3, it was 4.9 which is extremely high and the only thing I have taken, I have done differently was to have my Pfizer injection on 28Jan2021. Consumer stated, &#34;It is already in your system because as I said before I have report number. Should I give the report number. The person I spoke a long time ago that with I have been phone said that she information from my card when you they gave that card for you come like second time for the second dose or booster as I told this call.&#34; When probed for if the consumer call the Drug safety earlier: Consumer stated, &#34;That thing I am telling I spoke to someone by the name of (Name). She started asking by same question you did. That is why I am trying to tell you that person already asked me everything and give me report number. She wanted to transfer me because she says it is wrong department. I started here same information again. I have been on phone for far too long for this to be evening. The report number is &#39;number&#39;. Consumer stated, &#34;Concern is that I have Lupus and I take Warfarin. My INR report does part of what to do when you have lupus. You have blood measure monthly or whatever times that necessary. It is very high. It should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. I am trying to find out if the injection had interaction with warfarin that is medication I take. Blood thinner I take because I have lupus with antiphospholipid symptoms. I am trying to find out if the injection had any interaction with warfarin the blood thinner. That is the information I am trying to to get. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. The consumer has taken the Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Consumer stated, &#34;That is the first thing I said. I told you and then I am telling about warfarin. I said I wanted to know if the Pfizer vaccine which I took on 28Jan2021 as I said that before if it had conflicting reactions with warfarin. I explained to you I have lupus and I also have antiphospholipid syndrome which cause me to take warfarin medication. I want to know if the Pfizer injection had any negative interaction with warfarin the blood thinner.&#34; When consumer informed about Medical Information: Consumer stated, &#34;That person transfer to me before. It was drop. So can you connect me to number. She tried to transfer me and I got nowhere to call just died. If I call I am gonna be on waiting for all over again. I already had experience consumer stated, &#34;I have already been answered all of your questions that is why I have a reference report number that I gave you. I have been answered whole time questions. I answered everything. I just wanna be connected to get somebody because I am tired of being on the phone.&#34; Is there a product complaint to report was no. Consumer was provided with the number of Medical Information number and was requested to select option 3, timings as and 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Sundays as per (EST). Investigation Assessment: Yes. She had the first dose of the Pfizer covid19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She is nervous. She lives with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, which means her blood is too thick. She is on a blood thinner, she takes warfarin. She is asking if the vaccine could interfere with warfarin. Today she had her INR checked and it was was 4.9. States a stable reading is between 2 and 3. The only different thing she has had in her body is the vaccine. Reports she is nervous and scared. She had surgery on her feet and she has a wound where a thicker scab came off, states it is draining but not drying out. She was thinking maybe this was due to her her INR being high. She will see the surgeon tomorrow. She put a bandaid on her foot where the open wound on her foot is. The next morning she checked her foot and the bandaid was wet. She put some peroxide on it. She read peroxide is not good for open wounds because it kills good bacteria so she used gauze and placed it over the open wound with tape across it. Last month her warfarin dose was 6 mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week. As of today she is to take 3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week. Warfarin is 6mg tablet that is perforated, clarifies it can be broken in half. She does not think her new regimen that she was given today will bring her INR back in the range between 2 and 3. States her INR has never been that high. She will go back to see the nurse in two weeks to get her INR checked. She sees her patient medical record number listed on the card. She says pardon her grunts and moans because she grunts and moans when she moves since she is 76. She feels weird and her eyes are extra dry in 2021. She is nervous about the area where she had surgery on her feet, she does not want it to get infected. She thinks she had surgery on 04Dec2020 to have arthritis in her toes corrected. Outcome of events was unknown.

I got tinnitus in 2006 and since then have had every vaccination known to man:  typhoid, meningitis, Tdap, shingles (Zostavax and 2 Shingrix), pneumonia (Pneumovax and

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night. They are scheduling her for an MRI in Jan2021.Patient was also scheduled for the second dose on 01Feb2021 and will be on the prednisone until 26Jan2021; she would like to know whether the prednisone will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before. Final outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284; expiry date: unknown) , via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 18Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ear problems in the past and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID shot on 18Jan2021. By Wednesday, two days later (20Jan2021), both ears were messed up, she was running a temperature (also reported as low-grade fever), had a headache, and was very nervous. She went to the doctor and her doctor gave her an antibiotic shot, two steroid shots, and some antibiotic ear drops, which did not work. She then did a home call with the doctor and she provided more steroids, an oral pack, and an oral antibiotic for 5 days. She was still having problems with her ears. Mainly her left ear. It goes from ear to ear. She went to the ENT about the earaches which turned out to be infected, and has subsequently been on two rounds of antibiotics, with persistent symptoms that have gotten better over time. Patient wanted to know if this could relate to the COVID Vaccine. She has never had this happen before, and she has been really sick but not this bad. She has had ear problems in the past, but normally the antibiotic liquid drops clear it up. It was like a chronic ear ache. Her earaches were hurting bad. What she is wondering is if it could be a side effect from the first COVID shot. She clarifies that her ears are swollen on the inside. It was an infection somewhere. The antibiotics and steroids have not healed it up. All of these events were still occurring but come and go. For instance, yesterday she had a low temperature but has not yet had one today. The antibiotic ear drops prescribed were Neopoly HC OTSC 1% OTIC SU. NDC: 24208-635-62. Expiry date: Jun2022. She was unsure what the lot was but also sees: 349111. The oral antibiotics she has is Amoxicillin 875mg/125mcg. These are in a pharmacy vial. Use before: 26Jan2022. She was given two steroid shots. One shorter acting and one longer acting. She was unsure of the names. Oral steroid pack: Manufactured by Pharmaceutical name. Prednisone USP 5mg. REV 1016. 314518. lot: 1150419. Expiry date: Feb2022. She also pre-treated with allergic reaction medications. She goes back to the ENT on Thursday. Patient wanted to know if these had happened to anyone before. Outcome of the event pyrexia was unknown, for events ear swelling, ear pain and ear infection was recovering, while for the other events was not recovered.

The patient received the vaccine due to her age and she was due for it. Medical history included fractured ankle. Pateint&#39;s height was five two and shrinking. She is on (networking site) with people she went to high school with and they are all getting the shot at same time because of their age. They were all saying they have had no side effects and no symptoms. There were no concomitant medications. The patient read the information they gave her after the shot. Now, she knows why she has felt so stupid. It was all the stuff on the list. On 28Jan2021 about 19:00, she had a day and a half of diarrhea and she was having chills occasionally. On 28Jan2021, she felt totally exhausted. A little bit of everything. She was not nauseous. On 29Jan2021, she has been able to eat, but nothing tasted that great. Even when her son got her what she wanted it still did not taste great. She is coming off a fractured ankle and she is going to have cancel therapy because she doesn&#39;t feel well enough to do that. She got the first vaccine on 27Jan2021. It will be a week on Wednesday. On Thursday and Friday she had diarrhea. Serious quantity of Pepto Bismol kept that at bay. The exhaustion has only improved a little. It was good for her to get up and move.  No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event diarrhea was recovered on 29Jan2021; events chills and exhausted was recovering; event &#39;she has been able to eat, but nothing taste that great&#39; was not recovered; and unknown outcome for the other events.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell. She said she was tested the Friday before her nephew&#39;s funeral and was negative for the COVID-19 Virus. She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her. She said when she looked down at the label, she saw an IV access was put in her arm. Additional treatment reported when she was in the Emergency Room, she was given an injection (clarified as IVPB on 13Feb2021) of Diltiazem 120mg at 12:13:50 PM, she said she was given another Diltiazem 5mg injection at the same time. She clarified she was diagnosed in the Emergency Room with Atrial Fibrillation. Patient stated that her blood pressure went up while she was in the Emergency room. She said she was kept in the Emergency Room so she could be monitored up until that evening. She said after the Diltiazem injections were given, her heart rate went down. She said the Emergency Room doctor gave her a prescription for Diltiazem 120mg white capsules, and told her to take the Diltiazem 120mg every day. She said the emergency room doctor told her she could go home, and that she needed to follow-up with her regular doctor. Reported she no longer has the shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or weakness. She said had felt a little tired at that time, as well. Patient also reported that on 22Feb2021 was her first day outside of her house since last Sunday (14Feb2021) and reported she has a slight headache, and her sight is not clear. She said she now feels she has &#34;name&#34; back, clarifying she has recovered completely. She has a follow up with her doctor on 24Feb2021. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on 04Mar2021 and is asking if she should take anything before the shot. Vaccination Facility Type was a pharmacy/drug store.

                                                Patient reports being in her usual state of good health when she presented for COVID19 Vaccination. She reports onset of diplopia  without other symptom approximately 45 minutes after vaccination.  Later that night she notes  onset of full L eye ptosis which resulted in resolution of the diplopia. She was evaluated by ophthalmology the next day, 2/11, and was referred to the ER where she had a brain CT with no acute changes and unremarkable labs.  Treatment with Plavix 75mg was initiated. She was evaluated in my office on 2/16 for persistent ptosis of her L eye and her exam  is consistent with isolated third nerve palsy.   Diabetes and lipid levels are at target.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (manufacture unknown, Lot Number: 9264), intramuscularly in left arm on 29Jan2021 14:55 at 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included non-hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from Jul2019 and ongoing (The first time she was diagnosed was Jul2019. She then went into remission and then got the cancer back, she doesn&#39;t know when. She knows they started treating it as the cancer had returned in Aug 2020), watering eyes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine), chemotherapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she is a cancer patient on chemotherapy), fever blister from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced she had bell&#39;s palsy and she does not know if she got this from the covid shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. on 02Feb2021, droop in her lip/mouth on 02Feb2021, her eye was still watering on 02Feb2021, there was a little puffing around the eye/ puffiness around her eye on 02Feb2021, double vision on an unspecified date, the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech on an unspecified date. Caller was calling about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She said on Friday 29Jan2021 she had the first shot at about 12:30. Her eye started watering in the morning Thursday the day before and she maybe assumed she was getting a cold in her eye but it was really runny and she got the shot. She was a cancer patient on chemo and she went to the doctor because she was supposed to get her chemo. That Tuesday morning she had a droopy lip on the right side and her eye was still watering, there was a little puffing around the eye and the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech so she thought stroke but she was going to get her chemo in an hour or 2 so she when they checked her she told them what happened, she was seeing the PA that day so she left and came back 10 minutes later and said she had talked to the doctor, they were not going to give chemo today and told her she had Bell&#39;s Palsy and she does not know if she got this from the COVID shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. This was her first shot so as a cancer patient on chemo should be getting the second shot 21Feb. She was concerned about taking that when she already has Bell&#39;s Palsy now, what else would it cause and then if she does not get it would she be 50 % protected. The doctor seemed to say she thought it was from the vaccine, but caller does not know because the eye watering began the day or 2 prior to getting the vaccine. Product details: She does not have the vaccine card right with her and she was using a walker to get up and down and so she was not able to provide NDC lot expiration right now. It would be available if needed at a later time. Indication: doctor said she should have it because she has no immune system. They don&#39;t know what to do they are just following what they told her and they were scared to death. The caller states she was a cancer patient on chemotherapy. She received her first Pfizer COVID-19 injection on Friday, 29Jan2021. Prior to the vaccine, her eye had been watering Thursday or Friday morning before she had shot, it was just her right eye. On Tuesday, 02Feb2021, she developed a droop in her mouth and puffiness around her eye and so forth. Caller clarified it was just on the right side and with her right eye. She also has double vision in her right eye. She got up in the morning on 02Feb2021, and her husband was in the other room and told her that she sounded funny. She explained to her husband her mouth was dry and she was kind of slurring her speech. Her husband came into the room she was in and said, &#34;huh, your lip was drooping&#34;. Since it was in the morning and she had no other symptoms besides the talking funny and the puffiness around her eye, she didn&#39;t take it as a stroke. She figured she would just until she went to her chemotherapy appointment she had the same day, 02Feb2021. She went into her appointment and showed the person and gave her information on what happened. The person wanted an MRI of the brain to make sure she didn&#39;t have cancer there or cancer anywhere else up in that area and also that she didn&#39;t have a stroke. She confirms the MRI was fine, both were negative for any signs of this. She was told she developed bell&#39;s palsy. She has a drooping lip. The caller was concerned about her second shot. She wants to know should she getting the second vaccine, because the person at the (institution name) office (where she receives her chemotherapy) believes the bell&#39;s palsy came from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was supposed to have chemotherapy that day (02Feb2021), but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her then, but she did have it done yesterday. Caller explains she has no NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the chemotherapy she receives. She isn&#39;t given any stuff with any numbers and she gets numerous medications. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination): Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine because as she was sitting waiting to receive her injection, she remembers wiping her eye and thinking to herself, &#34;I wish this eye would quit watering&#34;. Caller states she had a fever blister, but she was not quite sure about when this appeared. She doesn&#39;t know if she had developed the fever blister before or the next day after receiving the vaccine, she was not quite sure. The any events were not required a visit to Emergency Room. She went to the Oncology Office for her chemotherapy appointment. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller had the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on 02Feb2021 showed she didn&#39;t have a stroke and no cancer of the brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: negative on 02Feb2021 Negative for stroke and/or cancer. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that she did not experience any problems until 27Jan2021 around noon, in which she started experiencing chills, cramps, and diarrhea all afternoon. She would like to know if these reactions have been reported and if they continue to persist, can she take something like Imodium. She didn&#39;t have any effect at all from it on Monday or Tuesday, and at noon on 27Jan2021, she had nausea and constant chills and diarrhea, she doesn&#39;t think this was a side effect, but wanted to check and see.

                                                I gave the patient her first COVID vaccination today at approximately 10:30am. After about 30 minutes, she reported tingling lips and a puffy tongue but no trouble breathing. After consulting with our clinical pharmacists, I gave her 50mg IM Benadryl and observed her for another hour. Her vitals were stable. She felt like the Benadryl helped (tingling gone, tongue felt achy), and no other symptoms appeared. She went home with instructions to call the ED with concerns if she developed signs of anaphylaxis, and to take more Benadryl if any tingling/itching occurred. I spoke with her at 7pm this evening and she reports her symptoms have mostly resolved (still a bit of an achy tongue).

Also beginning Friday, March  5th woke up with right arm swollen just below the elbow.  Not sure if any of this is related to the Covid shot or having other problems. Just noticed that my vaccine card shows Lot #EN6202 but the letter sent says Lot #EL9263, for the 2nd dose.

                                                Loss of voice; Asthma; her voice became extremely hoarse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included sore arm. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 (lot number: EN6198) on 23Feb2021 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn&#39;t tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn&#39;t want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn&#39;t used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn&#39;t want it to get worse. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination. The event hoarseness started on 18Mar2021 and loss of voice on 23Mar2021. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The outcome of the event hoarseness was not recovered, Loss of voice recovered on 13Apr2021 and asthma was unknown. The events hoarseness and loss of voice was reported as serious-medically significant.  Follow attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Hoarse voice and Loss of voice cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

This all lasted about 5-10 minutes. Resolved on its own. Felt a little shaken but OK afterwards.

A 79-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that everything was going fine until she had her COVID-19 vaccine on 09Feb2021, and then on 10Feb2021 she had the liraglutide injection. That&#39;s when everything went wrong and had to be hospitalized. She is losing her magnesium and her potassium. She had diarrhea, hadn&#39;t eaten in 5 weeks, was throwing up, and lost weight. She just can&#39;t eat, everything tasted so bland. She is getting better now though. The action taken for liraglutide was unknown. The outcome of the events was recovering. No follow-up attempts are possible; information about the lot number cannot be obtained.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 28Feb2021 10:20, as single dose, for Covid protection, at the hospital. Medical history included atrial fibrillation and ablation. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation and to prevent stroke from 2019. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 28Feb2021 and was scheduled to get the second dose on 21Mar2021 (Sunday). On 12Mar2021, her left eye was black, it was a purple eggplant in color. She wondered if she needed to tell the doctor and remembered her mother had blood vessel that burst. The patient clarified that it was to the side of her eye and not in her eye. It was bleeding under her eye. The nurse wanted the patient to stay so she could do some research. The nurse told her that the Pfizer vaccine caused the bleeding around the eye. The patient didn&#39;t want to have the second dose of the vaccine. She was told that she needed to report it. The nurse also told her that she needed to have her blood levels checked and that she does not need to take the second dose until she gets her blood levels checked. She went to her doctor&#39;s office but her primary care doctor and the other doctor were on vacation. She was seen by the nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner told her that she had to take the second shot and she might have to come off the blood thinner. She underwent blood work on an unspecified date with unknown results. She was told that the nurse practitioner has to study up on this and might have to come off of the blood thinner in order to get the second dose. She has been on blood thinner since 2019 after having an ablation. She has done wonderful. She is on this to prevent a stroke. She is on Eliquis. She is thankful for it. She has gone in and out of atrial fibrillation while taking Eliquis. The patient didn&#39;t want to take a chance on the second dose of the vaccine in case of hemorrhaging and was scared to take the second dose. Her blood clotting time was checked on 17Mar2021 and her prothrombin time was 16.2 seconds (standard: 11.9-14.5 seconds). She was hoping that Pfizer could advise her on taking the second dose. She thinks she will cancel her appointment for 21Mar2021. She is afraid to have the vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Pfizer vaccine caused the bleeding around the eye/bleeding under her eye&#34; and &#34;Black eye/left eye was black.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1687), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 80 years, on 29Jan2021 17:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cataract, arthritis and seasonal allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.

After she got the shot, she gradually noticed aches all over and back pain. It was stated it hurt really bad in her back on the right side on the bone and she used the heating pad on it. Then the next day she was stiffer than ever and she couldn&#39;t bend over. She added her eyes were blurry, they felt like she had a cold in them, and she felt pressure in them. She added she always has this problem with her eyes but it got a little worse after the shot. All of that has gotten better now. It was stated they are telling her the second dose was worse and she was unsure about getting the second dose. Also mentioned they were saying you can wait a little longer and she was unsure if maybe she should wait. She wanted to ask about getting the second dose. She added she was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 19Feb2021. The patient said it was right sided back pain. She said she applied heading pad and took ibuprofen. She also experienced &#34;eye pressure&#34; and &#34;blurry eyes&#34;, &#34;how you feel when you have a bad head cold&#34;. She said, &#34;I have allergies-seasonal, so this isn&#39;t new to me&#34;.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of back pain (back pain). The outcome of the events did not feel good, eyes were blurry/ she felt pressure in them and  bad head cold was unknown while other events were recovered on 31Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.

                                                Swollen tongue. Swollen neck glands. Headache, Racing heart. Blood pressure went to 190/95 Occurred after I arrived home.  Called Fire Department.  I was still able to talk and breath  so they did not use Epi pen.  Stayed with me because of BP concern.  Offered to bring me to Hospital.  Said to take Benydryl if symtoms began anew and to call them back and they would take me ER but as day progressed, symptoms subsided somewhat.  Higher BP readings continue and my PCP prescribed mild BP RX..

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 15:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.

Last night (07Feb2021) she unable to sleep the whole night as a result of lots of pain in her wrist and hand but especially thumb/wrist on the right side. she also reported swelling in her hand and was hardly able to bend her fingers. She tried to bend her fingers and she can but her wrist was swollen, it was less right now but she still had the pain. She applied muscle relaxant (unclear if topical) and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and massaged her hand with warm water and then for the second time she used the muscle relaxation. She hadn&#39;t taken paracetamol yet she was waiting 4 hours but the pain was still there, it was a little bit less. Not sure if it her arthritis or side effects from vaccine but believes it was from the vaccine. Stated she used to have the same problem with her wrist arthritis (pain). Also reported that she experienced additional side effects on 08Feb2021 which lasted about 5 minutes then went away: blurry eyes; wanting to faint; dizziness, sweating (whole body started to be like sweaty). Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing.

She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

She mentioned that this was not strange for her since she was mostly allergic to food but usually it was the outer portion of her lips that became swollen and not the inner portion. The next day, her cheeks, face, and the part under her chin became swollen and she felt something in her throat which she could describe. She also noticed that her vision on her good eye became a little depleted which got her a little concerned and her body also became swollen and stated that she already gained about 3 pounds now. She wanted to know if anyone had reported the same reaction she had and if it was recommended for her to get the 2nd dose or not. Outcome of events was unknown.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.

It&#39;s more in my right arm and I cannot lift my arm when it&#39;s happening and it leaves me weak, trembling and in a cold sweat and sometimes I&#39;m real hot. In February I went to the hospital and 4 doctors looked at me, I stayed there one day overnight .  I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

An 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), intramuscular on Left deltoid (upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 14:00 at single dose to prevent COVID. Medical history included sulfa drug reaction, high blood pressure diagnosed in 1970s or 1980s (States she was in the hospital in the 70s or 80s. She has high blood pressure which has been difficult to control, she is seeing a cardiologist and he is content with her blood pressure readings, her diastolic is normal), incontinence, thyroid nodule surgery a year ago (2020), thyroid nodule, ten operations in the last 3 years, tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery, scratchy throat problems since a week prior to getting the vaccine (from Jan2021) and post nasal drip and she has had that for years and when they operated nothing worked. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cipro where she could not breathe. She does not have lot, ndc or expiration date to provide for any of the medications mentioned that she had a reaction to. She took the Asiatic flu shot in 1958 (as reported), she had a reaction and high fever, weak and pale. This occurred when she was 19 years old. She took the Pfizer covid 19 shot last Wednesday. She stated that it could be her but she got a few of the reported side effects. What she found most important was that she had swollen lips that started about an hour after receiving the vaccine. Last night (13Jan2021) she got the chills and was shaking during the night. She had mild chills in the last few days, during the night she was shaking from the chills but it may have been cold at night, reporting the chills have subsided but she can feel it a little bit. In Jan2021, she felt a burning sensation in her left arm which lasted about two minutes. She got a piercing earache in her left ear for about two minutes and then it went away. She experienced nausea within two minutes, but she ate the ginger candy she had in her purse and her nausea went away. She could have something else too since she has a red dot on the inside of her throat. She did not see it was red before last night (13Jan2021). She took Benadryl on Wednesday afternoon after she called the doctor&#39;s office, she took the Benadryl thinking it was an allergic reaction, her swollen lips seemed like it was improved but now it was minor. She has had the tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery but she felt the tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, it is sort of still ongoing but states it has sort of improved. Patient also mentioned swelling on left side where the nodule was removed. She was asking if she should get the second dose. She has an appointment for her second dose. She has never had much problems till she was 80. Her husband tested negative for covid and she tested negative in Aug2020 prior to one of her surgeries. Patient stated that she is 83 but she is biologically younger. She felt pretty good normally. The events did not require emergency room visit or physician office visit. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the events burning sensation in her left arm, ear pain and nausea was recovered in Jan2021; Swollen lips, tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, chills was recovering; and unknown for the other events.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                she is short of hearing; losing her breathe; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer sponsored program. An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: Stage 3 lung cancer, radioactive therapy on 25Dec2020 to 31Dec2020 (Also reported as 2-days prior to her 1st vaccine shot, the nurse gave her 2 radioactive therapy and the last one was 31Dec2020), immune therapy on 01Jan2021 (7 weeks&#39; worth received all in 7 days), and steroid therapy on December 2020 and Jan2021. The patient had terrible reaction from the immune therapy on an unspecified date which include all the skin of her mouth had ulcers, had such sickness, diarrhea, a rash all over the face, had headaches, was so fatigued, no energy and could not get out of bed. Patient felt better in the past few days. Other medical history included had a bad fall, two broken ribs and needed hip replacement surgery from unspecified dates. She lives alone and received 700 units a day of steroids for 10-days last December.  Family history included lung cancer runs in her family (sister and brother died of lung cancer, other sister got it too).  Patient stated her doctor called her in 2 days before and stated her next step was immune therapy, she has had massive doses of radioactive before, she had 7 weeks of that in 10 days, and had an extreme reaction from that, the last one was 31Dec2020. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated she refused her immune therapy, as she wanted the vaccine. It was put down as she did not want it. The patient reported that nurse there then said she was going to be put on unspecified steroid, which she never had before. Her friend picked up the prescription and, without reading everything, and she usually does, she took two of them. It said take all 6 that evening, but she took 2 then read and it said not to take with any vaccine. She stated that the nurse knew how she stressed she wanted the vaccine, and so she had the COVID vaccine. She just had the two steroids, and she said she wanted to wait until Mar2021 until she considered getting immune therapy, but the nurse booked her for 26Feb2021, and she had her second vaccine from Pfizer scheduled on 19Feb2021 one week apart. She asked if that is too soon, and does she need to put off immune therapy again. She read it is 2-3 weeks between, she wanted to have this verified. Patient stated she supposed to take 6 steroids then 5 and so on. She took 2 pills then as she was reading information regarding the vaccine, she did not take anymore.  Last week is when she took the two steroids, she won&#39;t take them. She called a pharmacist, who said do not take them. The doctor&#39;s office, the nurse, gave them, after she told them she would have the vaccine. She stated she was furious, but she was getting this all the way down the line. She put the steroids away, she said she was not taking them, she talked to someone in the medical field and told her how she felt, and she agreed.  Patient asked if it will be ok to have the immune therapy at that time and soon after getting the vaccine if it would be effective. She mentioned that at her age she is more concerned that she gets that vaccine and she wants to delay having the immune therapy until March given the horrible reaction she had before. She tried and tried to have this conversation with her doctors, but she does not have all that technology and they are only offering remote appointments. Patient stated that she had no problems from the first dose of the vaccine stating she did not even feel the needle. She has been exactly an hour on the phone. The patient stated that she was losing her breathe after speaking at this time during the call on 05Feb2021. She also stated she is short of hearing (onset date unknown). Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020.

The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Starts around 4 pm.  Lot of pain right side of face like:  1.  toothache, whole jaw aches   2.  neck arthritis   3. sinus infection  4.  ear infection all at the same time.  Strong pain all through right side of face, sometimes up through eye.  Worse lying down.  Cause?   Dental exam complete mouth x-rays indicated no problems with any teeth.  Saw Dr. 3/3/2021, was checked for ear, sinus infections, felt all around my neck, no problems.  Prescribed gabapentin, told to continue the Tylenol Arthritis I had been taking on my own.  Symptoms continue today, only right side of face, head, temple area, sometimes up through right eye, teeth on right side ache.  Only take the Tylenol once a day since that is all that I need it.  More painful if I lie down in bed at night so sit upright until pain is gone; then sleep through the night.  No problem all during the day when I?m up and around doing whatever. . .no pain then.  Someone in my dental office has the same symptoms along with Bells Palsy, was told by her doctor it&#39;s from the Covid shot and could last 3 months? Pharmacist also told me filling the gabapentin for several others with same symptoms (I live in a small town).

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation; pyrimethamine (Tablet, Lot Number: AM0737A; Expiration Date: 31Jul2022) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg once daily for toxoplasmosis retinitis. Medical history included toxoplasmosis retinitis (eye infection toxoplasmal), vision loss (Blindness), and an allergy to sulfa medications. Concomitant products were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient had a second dose of the Covid vaccine. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 (over the last month of 01Mar2021), after starting the products, the patient had worsening vision loss (visual impairment) in her eye within one month of receipt of the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient felt the only thing that was new was she had just received the second dose of the Covid vaccine. As of 01Mar2021, the statuses of treatment with pyrimethamine and the worsening of vision loss in her eye were ongoing. An association with pyrimethamine cannot be ruled out. However, the event is confounded by toxoplasmosis retinitis, vision loss, and receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, which the reporter notes was the only new occurrence. The action taken in response to the events for pyrimethamine was dose not changed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of had worsening vision loss in her eye. The outcome of the events was unknown. The reported was considered as other serious (important medical events).  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

She is asking if the vaccine could have had anything to do with this?  She has not had a previous episode like this before. She did have some minor injection site pain at the time of the vaccine but that has subsided.  Follow-up call with patient on 1/30/31 at 19:37: Spoke to the patient. She is feeling better today.  She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

                                                migraine aura/migraine that was strong enough that she could not see; flashing lights; blocked vision/migraine was strong enough that she could not see; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reported for herself. A 87-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 18Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication reported as unspecified (Caller states that she does take a few medications but nothing has changed with those in years, so she does not think anything else is relevant). Historical vaccine include flu shot and does have reactions. Caller stated she received Pfizer COVID shot first dose and within an hour she had migraine without the headache but did have the vision blocked out. It resolved after some time. she wanted to know the ingredient of the vaccine to see if she should take the second dose. Caller states that she had her first Pfizer COVID Shot on 18Jan2021. Caller states that she didn&#39;t have any of the ordinary reactions, both the caller and her husband had the shot and neither of them got a sore arm or swelling at the site. Caller states that after they stayed for a half an hour, and when they were driving back to, the caller started to get a migraine aura. Caller states that she has had them before, but not often, and she has not had one for about 10 years. So caller states that her aura started while they were driving, and then the caller&#39;s husband dropped the caller off at the grocery store. After being dropped off, caller states that her migraine came on strong. Caller states that her migraine was strong enough that she could not see, she was experiencing flashing lights, and blocked vision. Caller finally turned to another customer to ask if he could see the cucumbers in front of them. Caller states that she waited outside for her husband to get her. Caller states that migraine probably lasted for about 45 minutes. Caller is wondering if this could have been from the shot or not. Caller states that she does have reactions to flu shots sometimes, but not like this. Outcome of the events was recovered on 18Jan2021.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn. Medical history included hiatus hernia surgery from Nov2019, surgery from an unknown date, vomited after surgery for three nights/days, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cancer, feet burning, feet red, asthma and thyroid. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), fluid pill, vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, acid reflux pill before nighttime before supper, thyroid pill, singulair pill. The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression..&#34; She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn&#39;t get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that&#39;s the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn&#39;t know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight. The action taken in response to the event for gabapentin was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event &#34;Pain in arm&#34; was recovering, the outcome of the event fatigue was not recovered, the outcome of the events &#34;temperature 99.2&#34; and &#34;Vomiting&#34; was recovered, and outcome of other events was unknown.
