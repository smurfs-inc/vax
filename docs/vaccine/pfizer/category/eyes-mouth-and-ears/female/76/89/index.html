                                                Approximately 1 hour after the shot, I raised a hive on my upper lip.  It very quickly (within 2 minutes) got to its maximum size.  Not noticeably swollen to an observer, but it felt swollen, red and throbbing. It was not a serious adverse reaction.  After about an hour, it was NOT going away, but it was NOT getting worse.  I never experienced trouble breathing. The office where I had the shot is &#34;not available&#34; on Friday afternoon, and my personal physician is not in the office on Friday.  I was advised by another doctor friend to take benadryl, which I did.  While looking at the CDC website, he also advised me that (having had this reaction) I should not receive the second shot.

                                                she hasn&#39;t been eating like she should; lost eye sight for 5 minutes, everything was grey; could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away; very nauseated/wanted to throw up but couldn&#39;t; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, reporting for herself. A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 29Jan2021 14:00 at a single dose to prevent getting COVID-19. Medical history included cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis, medications for her heart, and medication for her stomach. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for high blood pressure and atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient has been on amlodipine in a good while, 7-8 years and atorvastatin for 5 years. The patient had the COVID shot on Friday, 29Jan2021 at 14:00, and about 4 hours afterward, she had a bad experience. She became very nauseated and lost her sight for 5 minutes. Everything was grey. She was wondering if there is anything she can take afterward. She was scheduled for her next one on 19Feb2021. She was wondering if she will experience the same thing. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. After getting the vaccine, she was on her way back. She began to feel very nauseated in the car. Then, all the sudden she wanted to throw up, but couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t hear her niece or say anything to her. She clarified she could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away. She couldn&#39;t respond. She rolled the window down to get air in her face. She hadn&#39;t eaten. In about 25-30 minutes got better. Since then, she hasn&#39;t been eating like she should, so she was still a little nauseated. It has improved though. She got the vaccine in her left arm.  Her right arm is mostly metal. She decided to get it because she is over 70 and wanted to prevent getting COVID-19. It was also reported that she was also on an arthritis medication, medications for her heart and a medication for her stomach. She has had no problems with those medications though. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: lost on an unspecified date. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. The outcome of the events &#34;lost eye sight for 5 minutes, everything was grey&#34;, &#34;could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away&#34; and &#34;very nauseated/wanted to throw up but couldn&#39;t&#34; was recovered on 29Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.

                                                The first night after the vaccine had a headache and woke up with pain near her mouth.  The 2nd night, Tuesday, 2/16/21 it got bad, woke up around the same time early morning,  had pain on the right quadrant of her upper body, from her ear, eye, throat and down to right under her throat.  When she swallows the pain is very severe with difficulty swallowing and that pain radiates to the upper part of her chest.   Then on the third night, last night, all the same pain but the headache had disappeared.   Today, 2/18/21 she is still having the same symptoms.  The hardest thing to deal with is the ear pain in the right ear, and the pain under her right throat area.  She has taken one Benadryl at 8:00 AM, and will take another at 8:00 PM.  The Benadryl triggers her tinnitus so is limited with that.  Her daughter is trying to find OTC medicine for the ear.  She has not called her doctor as they are trying to treat it with OTC medicines.    For additional information call her daughter: who takes care of all her medical information.

She \ requested to lie down and was escorted to a stretcher. She was provided   oral loratidine with slight improvement of symptoms. Approximately 30 minutes after her inoculation her status had not worsened but she requested to be taken to the emergency department. Rapid Response team was notified and assisted her to the ED.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, my daughter took me to my Cardiologist appointment (this was scheduled before I received the vaccine). When I got to my doctor my blood pressure was elevated, it was about 180/88. My blood pressure is never that high. It did go down before I left to 140/84. When we were walking in the elevator after leaving the appointment my gait was unsteady. I felt very weak. I also light headed, and dizzy.  It felt like the feeling of the sedation you have receive  before having surgery. When we made it home I couldn&#39;t even see straight.  This lasted about 2 hours. I feel much better today.

                                                Patient was here for her 2nd dose vaccine and during her wait time her tongue started to feel funny and swell slightly. Staff was notified as they were talking with her that  her voice sounded a little funny and thick. She also started to cough on a regular interval. As staff continued talking with her she stated her throat started to feel funny and tight. Staff notified other healthcare personal and moved her to the private  treatment area. She continued to complain of thick tongue and continued to speak different then her baseline. We elected to give 50 mg Benadryl IM. She was also placed on the ECG showing sinus rhythm with O2 stats of 100 % and her blood pressure was 149/61, After the Benadryl, she stated she started to fell somewhat better. After about 10 minutes her tongue started to swell again and when she turned her head to speak to a staff member her airway shut off due to swelling. Staff quickly turned her head back to forward she was able to breath again.  She advised that she needed to be transported and was going to get 0.3 epi IM in her left arm. She did state prior to Epi being given she was now also having trouble focusing visually. Dr arrive to assess her and agreed that she needed transported. EMS arrived and care was turned over to Huntertown EMS to transport the patient to Medical Center.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This 76-year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL8982, expiry date; May2021), NDC number, UPC number; unknown, covid19 vaccine manufacturer; unspecified intramuscular from 28Jan2021 to 28Jan2021 at single dose on deltoid left (left upper shoulder) for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history included ongoing antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus (Patient medical continuing: Yes, diagnosed around 19 years old), surgery on her feet on 04Dec2020, blood thinner. Concomitant medications included Warfarin (tablet), strength; 6 mg orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date ongoing at 3 mg (6mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week) and then at 3 mg (3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week) for blood thinner. Laboratory test included INR (International normalised ratio) done on 04Feb2021 with result as (4.9; it is very high). Additional Information for concomitant products Warfarin: Her dose varies, new chart as of todays visit states to take 6mg on Sunday, 6mg on Monday 3mg on Tuesday, 6mg on Wednesday, 3mg on Thursday, 6mg on Friday, and 3mg on Saturday. Patient reported that INR should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. Consumer stated, &#34;I have been hold for almost for 2 hours because what happens I left my number as requested for call back. I got a call back in another 2 minutes. When I press to receive a call it disconnected. So I had to start all over again. So it is been like 2 hours adventure. Firstly I need to say that someone I told to call a second number well disconnect me twice but I have something call a report number that the person I think it has same job title of you. I am not certain but her name is (Name) and she gave me report number. She asked me all the questions, I answered all the her questions including my 28Jan2021 Pfizer injection which was my first injection and I have question referring to my taking Warfarin and wanted to if there was interaction because I went to doctor today to see my blood was instead 2.5 to 3, it was 4.9 which is extremely high and the only thing I have taken, I have done differently was to have my Pfizer injection on 28Jan2021. Consumer stated, &#34;It is already in your system because as I said before I have report number. Should I give the report number. The person I spoke a long time ago that with I have been phone said that she information from my card when you they gave that card for you come like second time for the second dose or booster as I told this call.&#34; When probed for if the consumer call the Drug safety earlier: Consumer stated, &#34;That thing I am telling I spoke to someone by the name of (Name). She started asking by same question you did. That is why I am trying to tell you that person already asked me everything and give me report number. She wanted to transfer me because she says it is wrong department. I started here same information again. I have been on phone for far too long for this to be evening. The report number is &#39;number&#39;. Consumer stated, &#34;Concern is that I have Lupus and I take Warfarin. My INR report does part of what to do when you have lupus. You have blood measure monthly or whatever times that necessary. It is very high. It should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. I am trying to find out if the injection had interaction with warfarin that is medication I take. Blood thinner I take because I have lupus with antiphospholipid symptoms. I am trying to find out if the injection had any interaction with warfarin the blood thinner. That is the information I am trying to to get. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. The consumer has taken the Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Consumer stated, &#34;That is the first thing I said. I told you and then I am telling about warfarin. I said I wanted to know if the Pfizer vaccine which I took on 28Jan2021 as I said that before if it had conflicting reactions with warfarin. I explained to you I have lupus and I also have antiphospholipid syndrome which cause me to take warfarin medication. I want to know if the Pfizer injection had any negative interaction with warfarin the blood thinner.&#34; When consumer informed about Medical Information: Consumer stated, &#34;That person transfer to me before. It was drop. So can you connect me to number. She tried to transfer me and I got nowhere to call just died. If I call I am gonna be on waiting for all over again. I already had experience consumer stated, &#34;I have already been answered all of your questions that is why I have a reference report number that I gave you. I have been answered whole time questions. I answered everything. I just wanna be connected to get somebody because I am tired of being on the phone.&#34; Is there a product complaint to report was no. Consumer was provided with the number of Medical Information number and was requested to select option 3, timings as and 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Sundays as per (EST). Investigation Assessment: Yes. She had the first dose of the Pfizer covid19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She is nervous. She lives with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, which means her blood is too thick. She is on a blood thinner, she takes warfarin. She is asking if the vaccine could interfere with warfarin. Today she had her INR checked and it was was 4.9. States a stable reading is between 2 and 3. The only different thing she has had in her body is the vaccine. Reports she is nervous and scared. She had surgery on her feet and she has a wound where a thicker scab came off, states it is draining but not drying out. She was thinking maybe this was due to her her INR being high. She will see the surgeon tomorrow. She put a bandaid on her foot where the open wound on her foot is. The next morning she checked her foot and the bandaid was wet. She put some peroxide on it. She read peroxide is not good for open wounds because it kills good bacteria so she used gauze and placed it over the open wound with tape across it. Last month her warfarin dose was 6 mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week. As of today she is to take 3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week. Warfarin is 6mg tablet that is perforated, clarifies it can be broken in half. She does not think her new regimen that she was given today will bring her INR back in the range between 2 and 3. States her INR has never been that high. She will go back to see the nurse in two weeks to get her INR checked. She sees her patient medical record number listed on the card. She says pardon her grunts and moans because she grunts and moans when she moves since she is 76. She feels weird and her eyes are extra dry in 2021. She is nervous about the area where she had surgery on her feet, she does not want it to get infected. She thinks she had surgery on 04Dec2020 to have arthritis in her toes corrected. Outcome of events was unknown.

It was mild at first but progressed to the point that it was interfering with the patient&#39;s speech.  Her breathing was not affected.  The swelling did subside some when the patient took allergy medication.  I recommended the patient be seen by a doctor, and her daughter agreed, but the patient was not keen on seeking medical care.

On March 22, 2021 I read an article about someone who committed suicide b/c of post-COVID tinnitus.  Three people commented that their tinnitus worsened after their COVID vaccinations.

On Tues. his job told him to get a COVID test. He went in Wed. and the rapid test was positive.  I went down hill.  I had headache, chills, sore all over, sore throat, coughing, shortness of breath, sore tongue, diarrhea, didn&#39;t have fever.  Was up Thursday night because of shortness of breath. Called Doctors office and was told to go to walk in clinic and someone would come out and get me.  Was seen by PA I think. Not a doctor. They only did a rapid test and it was negative. She didn&#39;t do the second test and send it off. I have found two people who had the rapid rest and results were negative that the results s Results sent in from second test came back positive. She prescribed Prednisone  which helped.  I was sick for over two weeks and still struggling with fatigue, aching , sore throat and shortness of breath.

For tinnitus she did not pay a lot of attention until Sunday, so she knew she got it on Saturday, or Friday, unknown time. No ER or physician&#39;s office required. She did make an appointment with an ENT and audiologist on 24Mar2021. Patient did not know if it had anything to do with the vaccine. No infection. Somewhat of hearing loss in high frequencies, but she did not need a hearing aid. There were no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and no lab tests reported. Outcome of event tinnitus was reported as not recovered and outcome of event deafness and depressed mood was unknown.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing pollen allergy from an unspecified date and ongoing ribs sore from an unspecified date. The patient stated that the pollen was bothering her and that she had been taking Zyrtec in the morning and at night. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the event was reported as &#34;her son also had a seizure after the polio vaccine when he was 7 years old&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient denied any medications or medical conditions relevant to symptoms. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously received the polio vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced seizure and the patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date (6 years ago) for immunization and 8 hours after the vaccine was achy, sick, in bed for 9 days. Developed bronchitis and coughed so hard she cracked her ribs. Stated her ribs were still sore at times to this day. The patient stated that she would never get another flu shot and that her doctor agreed with her on that decision. On 25Mar2021 the patient experienced headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing. The patient stated that she got her second dose of the vaccine on 24Mar2021. She reported that after her first shot she was fine. She stated that she started having headaches and dizziness the day after her second vaccine and this had lasted for 14 days. It has gone on now for several weeks and was not getting any better. She felt her symptoms went in different degrees at different times of the day. She might go one day without a headache. Today her headache was more like a numbness all around her head. She stated that her headaches come and go, sometimes start when her eyes pop open in the morning or at 10 AM. If she was going to have a headache that day, it usually started by 10 AM and was a full-blown headache. Stated her head always fely fuzzy and woozy and sometimes she felt like her eyes were crossing. She stated that she never got headaches; not since her early 20s. Dizziness continued to come and go, but it affected her vision and she was scared to drive and have a wreck. She reported that the symptoms were driving her bonkers. She also reported that she had to hold onto walls when she walked. The dizziness did not go away even when she laid down. She was dizzy when sitting on the sofa. Her head also felt fuzzy and numb, the fuzziness was constant. She reported that she felt disabled and felt like she was turning 100 instead of 77. She cannot lay in bed all the time and wanted to know how long these symptoms would last. The patient denied any labs, testing or treatment relevant to symptoms. She had not been to the doctor or to the emergency room in relation to these symptoms. She stated that she thought about it at times. She stated that she would have to call an ambulance to take her since she was scared to drive. Yesterday she thought she was not doing so bad and drove to the store. She stated that while in the store, her dizziness had her to where she could hardly pay for her items. Stated that it kind of felt like she was drunk, but she was not drunk. The patient stated that her experience with the polio vaccine made her almost not get the COVID-19 vaccine for fear it would bring on a similar situation. The clinical outcomes of the events headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing were all not recovered/not resolved. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                March 10, 2021 I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the following day I experienced the predicted side effects of fever, chills, headache, fatigue and lack of appetite, which were all mild and I took Tylenol for the fever. The following day I was fine. After approximately two weeks I noticed there were subtle and unusual changes regarding my appetite, energy level an itchy rash on my back and a runny nose.  I didn?t pay much attention to any of these as they weren?t debilitating symptoms, but very unique for me. Then I realized I needed to pay more attention to these symptoms as they were getting more significant, except for the fact I didn?t have a fever.  Also my ears felt they were blocked.  I thought perhaps because of the feeling of blocked ears I may be getting a sinus infection although I haven?t had one in years. I called the doctor?s office on April 5th and I was told to go to the Urgent Care, which I did.  I was examined and given a prescription for a nasal spray, antihistamine and an antibiotic in case symptoms became more severe. It was also suggested that I may want to have a Covid test. I?m not used to taking any medications except for Trazodone, and was reluctant to take what was prescribed because if it was indeed a sinus infection it wasn?t in line with any I?d had years ago. I used the nasal spray for a few days and also the antihistamine. The headache got worse, and would move from one area of my head to another and also down the side of my face and neck. Tylenol didn?t help and Ibuprofen only helped now and again. The headache had a mind of its own. Warm compresses did help. I was in contact through the portal for recommendations from the medical staff.

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EM9810; NDC number: Not Provided Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 06Feb2021 at 8:31AM (at the age of 76 years), as a 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included disc protruding (diagnosed before the covid vaccine in Jun2020 or around that, she recalls having several months of MRI&#39;s in 2020) and high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Epidural Shot (Verbatim) for Protruding Disc Patient on 27Jan2021 (she had to go to the doctor in the clinic and get epidural shot in the back at the disc thats protruding). Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EL3249; NDC number: Not Provided, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at 12 PM (noon) as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 76 years) for COVID-19 immunization. Clinical course: She took second dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 06Feb2021, though she had no reaction initially. A week later from vaccination on Feb2021, she then began to notice her eyes started getting swollen couple days after, she then felt like her eyes felt like they were closing, then she saw her whole face was swelling, it looks like she had Chipmunk cheeks. She went to the doctor hoping it would go away, she was prescribed Benadryl and a decongestant as treatment. She takes Benadryl three times a day and the decongestant in the morning and her face is still swollen. It started with the eyes and the bag under the eyes, that was the first thing she noticed. She laughs and though she initially had an eye infection. She just wants to know if there is any other reports of this happening, or how to get rid of it, this has been there since she got her second dose on the 06Feb2021 since like 10Feb2021. After the second vaccine on 06Feb2021 around that time an hour later, she was on the way home and started getting hungry, she thought that was a symptom as well as her arm hurt a bit. She was starving till Monday got up 2AM, 6AM ate all day Sunday and Monday ate all day, as reported &#34;all she knows is she was craving a crab sandwich.&#34; Her Eyes swelling started a couple days later and the Face swelling was either the second week or same time, she just recalls looking at the eyes. She recalls telling her son her face felt tight in Feb2021. At the doctors appointment she was 127lbs, probably because of the swelling, but she is usually 119lbs or 118lbs, she is a small girl. The Appointment with the doctor was yesterday (15Mar2021), they prescribed Benadryl. Patient clarified that she was not Prescribed Zyrtec, it was a decongestant but she does not know the name of it. The Druggist however told her she could take another medication also. As reported &#34;The eye swelling and face swelling, at the moment she look like she been drunk, her face is plentiful, she is still swollen, her lids are not bad, but it is ongoing, it has gotten worse because prior she didnt even know it was there and its showing more now. She asked son if he thought she was swollen because she feels tight, over the weekend her face being swollen was noticeable, she is noticing people are pointing it out now.&#34; She adds her arm did not hurt with first dose. Second dose administered on the Left Arm, her arm did hurt a little on 06Feb2021, the day she got this dose and the next day (07Feb2021). She thought initially that she didn&#39;t have any side effects. She had High blood pressure yesterday (15Mar2021), but that usually goes up and down for her and nothing new. It was reported that, a week later, patient experienced swelling under her eyes, face was swollen, eye infection and face felt tight on Feb2021; hunger and vaccination site pain on 06Feb2021 (reported as the day she got this dose); hypertension on 15Mar2021 (reported as yesterday). Patient would like to know if swelling of the face is a reported side effect from the covid vaccine, how long her side effects from the covid vaccine will last and asking for suggestions on how to get rid of the side effects from the covid vaccine. The outcome of event vaccination site pain was recovered in Feb2021 (duration of event was 2 days), swelling under her eyes, face was swollen was not recovered while outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

After her infusion, both of her eyes were swollen, the right eye was sensitive to light, her eyes kept fluttering while looking up or bending over, and the right side of the face was swollen. This was constantly happening but is now getting better but not completely over. She mentioned that she talked to several doctors and they think that Remicade, since it lowers the immune system and decreases white blood cell count and the vaccine increases the white blood count, it has interfered with the signals with her eyes. She was also hospitalized from 29May2021 to 2Jun2021 for cellulitis and was given some antibiotics and steroids which she thinks helped with her symptoms. She was asking if this has been reported and if this will happen again on 24Jun2021 for her next Remicade infusion. she was taking Remicade before giving her the vaccine. she had concern, would the vaccine affect the Remicade and cause these reactions.

It would keep fluttering, and she would have to go sit down and close her eyes until it settled down. It interfered with her activities, and she didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving because she didn&#39;t know when it would hit her. Every time she talked to a doctor, they acted like she is crazy. It only seemed after the Remicade that this started happening, and now she was due for another Remicade infusion on 24Jun2021. She had some other health issues earlier this month and was put on antibiotics. The antibiotics seemed to help the eye it is not completely gone but better. She was wondering now if she should get the Remicade on 24Jun2021. She had skin cancer, and when they removed it, she got cellulitis in her leg. She was in the hospital for 3 days. She asked the doctor there and they brushed her off. The last day before she came home the nurse came in and wanted to know if she had her shot. She asked the nurse the same question about the vaccine and Remicade, and the nurse said now they ask people before they get the shot if they are on Remicade. The nurse didn&#39;t have anyone that said yes. It was seeming like there is some kind of problem with Remicade and the vaccine. That is why she was a little bit concerned about having it again.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night. They are scheduling her for an MRI in Jan2021.Patient was also scheduled for the second dose on 01Feb2021 and will be on the prednisone until 26Jan2021; she would like to know whether the prednisone will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before. Final outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

She went to the doctor and her doctor gave her an antibiotic shot, two steroid shots, and some antibiotic ear drops, which did not work. She then did a home call with the doctor and she provided more steroids, an oral pack, and an oral antibiotic for 5 days. She was still having problems with her ears. Mainly her left ear. It goes from ear to ear. She went to the ENT about the earaches which turned out to be infected, and has subsequently been on two rounds of antibiotics, with persistent symptoms that have gotten better over time. Patient wanted to know if this could relate to the COVID Vaccine. She has never had this happen before, and she has been really sick but not this bad. She has had ear problems in the past, but normally the antibiotic liquid drops clear it up. It was like a chronic ear ache. Her earaches were hurting bad.

Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect.

She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath.

She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath.

This 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies and sinus headaches which she takes (Excedrin) off and on for years in the past, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included atenolol (manufacturer unknown) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported. Past drug history included the patient received a flu shot (unspecified Flu shot) with a mega reaction she was sick for weeks which was at least probably 15-20 years ago So, she never got a flu shot after that and she has never had the flu. On 29Apr2021, the patient had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, dizzy/light headed, felt like I am going to faint, and ringing in the ears. On an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced allergic reaction. On 01May2021, she was really ill, and her blood pressure went up over 220 and pulse rate went way up. On 02May2021, she experienced headaches. On 06May2021, she was feeling a little weird and nauseous. On an unspecified date in May2021, her memory is a little off right now. The clinical course was as follows: the patient reported, &#34;I had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, it&#39;s okay now, I couldn&#39;t really move it. I feel I may be having a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine) got on Thursday (29Apr2021) of this past week. I am very light headed, dizzy and felt like I am going to faint, has ringing in the ears, and all that has been going on about a week, since last Thursday (29Apr2021). Then I was really ill last night (01May2021). It started last night when we went to bed around 11 O&#39;clock. I have never had anything like this in my life. My blood pressure was through the roof. With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything. They just felt that I was just having a major reaction to the shot so they sent me home. I just got home this morning (02May2021) from having to go to the emergency room. But as soon as we got home, I started with a humongous headache and so I had Excedrin/Tylenol for headaches because I used to get sinus headaches.

The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) intramuscular on 23Jan2021 at age of 77 years (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced deafness right ear/ lost hearing in right ear since 13Feb2021 18:00. The patient took HUMIRA shot on 17Jan2021. Physician said it was ok to take HUMIRA as long as and did not take  it the same day as Covid Vaccine since she had reaction and physician did not able to tell for which shot it might be allergic too if she had a reaction. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. Patient received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 23Jan2021. She took next Humira on 29Jan2021. On 13Feb2021 around 10 AM, patient took her second COVID-19 Vaccine manufactured by Pfizer.  On 13Feb2021 about 6 pm (18:00) or thereabout, she started hearing a ticking in right ear and by the 8 pm hearing was completely gone in the right ear. On 14Feb2021, she went to the immediate care center and was checked for no reason. Then she went to emergency room where she had a CT scan on 14 Feb 2021 for no reason and referred to ENT physician on 17Feb2021. She had a hearing test. She had two steroid injections in ear on 17Feb2021 and 26Feb2021 with no improvement. On 01Mar2021, she had MRI but no explanation was found. She was being fitted with a hearing aid in left and right ear as of 29Apr2021 and was having a little problem adjusting. The patient had lab tests in 2021 with unknown results. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of lost hearing in right ear with Humira 40MG/0.8ML (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility/ Possible. AbbVie&#39;s opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the event of lost hearing in right ear is related to Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml (Adalimumab). Causality with BNT162b2 for Deafness right ear (Deafness unilateral) per reporter was Probable. The action taken in response to the event for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible; Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current available information and a temporal association, the causal association between the event and the suspect drug BNT162B2 is assessed as possibly related. Consider also possible contribution from co-suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated a part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.  Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I first lost my nail. It was unusual because there was no trauma to the nail. I was reaching for something across my bed, and I started experiencing radiating pain across my chest as well as pressure. I stayed very still and then it spread through my left arm and up into my shoulder, neck ear and jaw. I remained still and tried breathing the best I could. This lasted a minute or two and then it released and was over. About a month later, I was diagnosed with RSV which ran down into my lungs and soon my blood pressure was going up because my heart was working so hard to breathe. It was over 200/175 which is abnormal for me. I had to end up calling an ambulance because I was having trouble breathing.

She reports onset of diplopia  without other symptom approximately 45 minutes after vaccination.  Later that night she notes  onset of full L eye ptosis which resulted in resolution of the diplopia. She was evaluated by ophthalmology the next day, 2/11, and was referred to the ER where she had a brain CT with no acute changes and unremarkable labs.  Treatment with Plavix 75mg was initiated. She was evaluated in my office on 2/16 for persistent ptosis of her L eye and her exam  is consistent with isolated third nerve palsy.   Diabetes and lipid levels are at target.

We also had a second person vaccinated the same day that also called with shingles so decision was made to enter this variance report.

                                                My Mom had an an allergic reaction four hours after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her face swelled up and became red....worse on the right side than the left...her eyes were swollen as well. It lasted this way for four days....it is a little better now, but her face is still a little swollen (seven days after shot). She had a headache on and off and felt tired (which we understand is not an allergic reaction, but rather an immune response). Her family physician suggested taking antihistamines before her second shot. Needless to say, we are apprehensive about what the outcome from the second shot will be like for her.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (manufacture unknown, Lot Number: 9264), intramuscularly in left arm on 29Jan2021 14:55 at 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included non-hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from Jul2019 and ongoing (The first time she was diagnosed was Jul2019. She then went into remission and then got the cancer back, she doesn&#39;t know when. She knows they started treating it as the cancer had returned in Aug 2020), watering eyes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine), chemotherapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she is a cancer patient on chemotherapy), fever blister from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced she had bell&#39;s palsy and she does not know if she got this from the covid shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. on 02Feb2021, droop in her lip/mouth on 02Feb2021, her eye was still watering on 02Feb2021, there was a little puffing around the eye/ puffiness around her eye on 02Feb2021, double vision on an unspecified date, the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech on an unspecified date. Caller was calling about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She said on Friday 29Jan2021 she had the first shot at about 12:30. Her eye started watering in the morning Thursday the day before and she maybe assumed she was getting a cold in her eye but it was really runny and she got the shot. She was a cancer patient on chemo and she went to the doctor because she was supposed to get her chemo. That Tuesday morning she had a droopy lip on the right side and her eye was still watering, there was a little puffing around the eye and the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech so she thought stroke but she was going to get her chemo in an hour or 2 so she when they checked her she told them what happened, she was seeing the PA that day so she left and came back 10 minutes later and said she had talked to the doctor, they were not going to give chemo today and told her she had Bell&#39;s Palsy and she does not know if she got this from the COVID shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. This was her first shot so as a cancer patient on chemo should be getting the second shot 21Feb. She was concerned about taking that when she already has Bell&#39;s Palsy now, what else would it cause and then if she does not get it would she be 50 % protected. The doctor seemed to say she thought it was from the vaccine, but caller does not know because the eye watering began the day or 2 prior to getting the vaccine. Product details: She does not have the vaccine card right with her and she was using a walker to get up and down and so she was not able to provide NDC lot expiration right now. It would be available if needed at a later time. Indication: doctor said she should have it because she has no immune system. They don&#39;t know what to do they are just following what they told her and they were scared to death. The caller states she was a cancer patient on chemotherapy. She received her first Pfizer COVID-19 injection on Friday, 29Jan2021. Prior to the vaccine, her eye had been watering Thursday or Friday morning before she had shot, it was just her right eye. On Tuesday, 02Feb2021, she developed a droop in her mouth and puffiness around her eye and so forth. Caller clarified it was just on the right side and with her right eye. She also has double vision in her right eye. She got up in the morning on 02Feb2021, and her husband was in the other room and told her that she sounded funny. She explained to her husband her mouth was dry and she was kind of slurring her speech. Her husband came into the room she was in and said, &#34;huh, your lip was drooping&#34;. Since it was in the morning and she had no other symptoms besides the talking funny and the puffiness around her eye, she didn&#39;t take it as a stroke. She figured she would just until she went to her chemotherapy appointment she had the same day, 02Feb2021. She went into her appointment and showed the person and gave her information on what happened. The person wanted an MRI of the brain to make sure she didn&#39;t have cancer there or cancer anywhere else up in that area and also that she didn&#39;t have a stroke. She confirms the MRI was fine, both were negative for any signs of this. She was told she developed bell&#39;s palsy. She has a drooping lip. The caller was concerned about her second shot. She wants to know should she getting the second vaccine, because the person at the (institution name) office (where she receives her chemotherapy) believes the bell&#39;s palsy came from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was supposed to have chemotherapy that day (02Feb2021), but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her then, but she did have it done yesterday. Caller explains she has no NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the chemotherapy she receives. She isn&#39;t given any stuff with any numbers and she gets numerous medications. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination): Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine because as she was sitting waiting to receive her injection, she remembers wiping her eye and thinking to herself, &#34;I wish this eye would quit watering&#34;. Caller states she had a fever blister, but she was not quite sure about when this appeared. She doesn&#39;t know if she had developed the fever blister before or the next day after receiving the vaccine, she was not quite sure. The any events were not required a visit to Emergency Room. She went to the Oncology Office for her chemotherapy appointment. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller had the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on 02Feb2021 showed she didn&#39;t have a stroke and no cancer of the brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: negative on 02Feb2021 Negative for stroke and/or cancer. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

She wondered if she should call Fire Dept (but wasn?t making total sense).  Her friend came, tried to help, but I think she decided to call 911 for help getting her up &amp; wants EMTs to check her out.  **She had fallen during Covid, went to ER &amp; they gave fluids &amp; she was ?good? for a week, but then dizzy &amp; severe lethargy, same friend took her to ER &amp; she was admitted (negative covid test at that point), but very large PE, thus heparin &amp; then Eliquis (Dec 2020).

After about 30 minutes, she reported tingling lips and a puffy tongue but no trouble breathing. After consulting with our clinical pharmacists, I gave her 50mg IM Benadryl and observed her for another hour. Her vitals were stable. She felt like the Benadryl helped (tingling gone, tongue felt achy), and no other symptoms appeared. She went home with instructions to call the ED with concerns if she developed signs of anaphylaxis, and to take more Benadryl if any tingling/itching occurred. I spoke with her at 7pm this evening and she reports her symptoms have mostly resolved (still a bit of an achy tongue).

                                                About 5 or 4 days ago my scalp towards the top of the head hurt while going to sleep on my back. I assume that I probably scratched my head while shampooing my hair. Then next day my right eye started to bother me. I thought I had bumped my eye while trying to clean the discharge I have in the mornings with q-tips. But finally it got worse until it hurt me. So I went to the ophtlamologist today who according to his diagnosis I had shingles. I just got an antiviral medication for the next seven days and drops to help clean my eyelids. This is so bothersome, sometimes while trying to read I see blurry.

Almost impossible to sleep at night. Doctor gave some prednisone yesterday to see if the auto immune reaction would diminish. The burning did not diminish.

Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Loss of voice; Asthma; her voice became extremely hoarse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included sore arm. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 (lot number: EN6198) on 23Feb2021 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn&#39;t tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn&#39;t want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn&#39;t used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn&#39;t want it to get worse. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination. The event hoarseness started on 18Mar2021 and loss of voice on 23Mar2021. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The outcome of the event hoarseness was not recovered, Loss of voice recovered on 13Apr2021 and asthma was unknown. The events hoarseness and loss of voice was reported as serious-medically significant.  Follow attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Hoarse voice and Loss of voice cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78-year-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing glaucoma (had it for 7 years), ongoing hypothyroid (started 7 years ago). It took her 5 years to find the right doctor and the right medication. It took a while to balance it off. She has been okay the last 2 years with the right medication; asthma from 1969(controls her allergies, so it did not turn into asthma), ongoing high blood pressure (had it all her life), allergy to glycerin and ongoing vertigo (started way before she had the vaccine). Concomitant medications included ongoing irbesartan (AVAPRO) for high blood pressure (She just went back to it about a year ago because it was doing really good then her blood pressure spiked up) and ongoing levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT SOL) for hypothyroidism for 3 years. The patient previously took flu shot and then had the flu and got pneumonia. On an unknown date, couple of days after the first dose the patient experienced redness in her eyes, about a week or 2 after the vaccination the patient couldn&#39;t focus. On 06Feb2021, the patient had pressure behind left eye and vertigo (vertigo). There were no relevant tests done. She was being treated for vertigo, but the vertigo was basically gone though she was seeing a physical therapist. The vertigo started way before she had the vaccine. The patient visited physician&#39;s office for the adverse events. The Patient did not go to the emergency room. The patient should have gone to the hospital, but she was afraid to be around people with Covid. She did not get vaccines at all because she fears having a reaction. The last vaccine she had in 2006 made her so sick she got pneumonia. It was for the flu, and she got the flu. The patient did not have any vaccination within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient thought it was important for her to take the vaccine which it took her awhile to talk herself into it because of her previous experience with adverse reactions. She took levothyroxine sodium solution because the patient was allergic to so many things. The first one they gave her was a gel capsule and it caused an itching reaction. The patient is allergic to glycerine and could not take capsules that have a glycerine encasement. The first one they gave her was a gel capsule and it caused an itching reaction. She was allergic to the preservative in eye drops. She did not know if the Covid vaccine had any preservative, she did not think it did. She looked it up and did not see anything she was allergic to. The patient had a long list of allergies. Her family all has high blood pressure and allergies. The outcome of the event vertigo was recovered on an unknown date, for redness in her eyes was not recovering while unknown for rest of the event.   Additional details unable to be obtained.

                                                her tongue felt burned; her mouth was burning; her throat was burning; acid reflux; everything was still burning; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included macular degeneration. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included tetanus vaccine on an unspecified date for immunisation. She got her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine on 25Feb2021 and thought she was having a reaction. She called her doctor and he said go get some Benadryl to make sure your throat doesn&#39;t get swollen. She went out and bought Benadryl and she took the Benadryl every six hours. Her doctor said don&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid 19 vaccine because these side effects she had are a warning and the second dose might not be helpful for her. The patient reported that she stayed at the facility that gave her the Covid 19 vaccine for 20 minutes and her husband was waiting for her. When she was driving away from the facility her tongue felt burned and then her mouth was burning and then her throat was burning on an unspecified date. She does have acid reflux but this wasn&#39;t like any acid reflux she&#39;s ever had. She got home and she drank some cool water but everything was still burning. By then it was almost supper time so she took 20 mg of Pepcid. Her mouth burned throughout her meal. She called her doctor again and he asked her if her mouth was swollen and she told him she didn&#39;t know. She took more Benadryl. One of her daughter&#39;s told her that the Covid 19 virus was so bad that she should get her second dose of the Covid 19 vaccine no matter how bad her reaction was. Her doctor told her not to get the second Covid 19 vaccine. She assumed it was a done deal. She wasn&#39;t going to get the second dose. She was supposed to get her second dose on 17Mar2021. She had gone to the doctor a couple times and each time he told her, do not get the second Covid 19 vaccine. He showed her the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine print out with side effects. When her mouth started burning after she got the first Covid 19 vaccine her husband did ask her if she wanted to turn around and go back to the facility where she got the vaccine but she told him no. Now she&#39;s missed her second Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021 because she thought that what her doctor told her was the final word. She was afraid to get the second Covid 19 vaccine and she wants to listen to her doctor because he knows what&#39;s best. During this Covid 19 virus time she was also diagnosed with Macular Degeneration. That&#39;s keeping her from driving and she&#39;s lost even more of her independence. She&#39;s heard if she gets the Covid 19 virus it can attack her eyes. Every time she hears the words fully vaccinated it makes her want to cry. She&#39;s worried that people won&#39;t want to be near her because she&#39;s not fully vaccinated. Her husband had both of his Covid 19 vaccines and he had no side effects. Her husband gets every vaccine on the market and never has any side effects. As far as she&#39;s concerned she feels like a pariah because no one will want to be around her because she&#39;s not fully vaccinated. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (02Jun2021): No follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                She got her vaccine, and within a day or two she had a feeling that her mouth was pulling sensation, and has had shingles in the paste.  She started using lip balm, and it would loosen up at the beginning.  Then, it started getting worse after a couple of days, and started circling her mouth.  On 3/5/21 she had a crust around her mouth and went to a doctor and said that she had psoriasis or eczema and told her that she could not treat it.   She has a band-aide on her face from the biopsy and has a picture for that.  She went to her for 4/5 visits and gave her a hydrocortisone cream and a cold tar treatment, and it stopped for about a week.   The cold tar burned to put it on her face, but was doing it, then that stopped.  She had an APT on 4/30/21 that she cancelled.  Then within the last 7 days it has recurred again.    She then went on 6/3/21 to Dr., which was a referral from her PCP, Dermatologist.  She demanded her records and he has marked off COVID screen and shingles in a circle and to FU in one month.   He has sent her to have patch testing, and to go see a Dr.  She informed the doctor of what she has been using for the rash, and he sent her to the other doctor.  She has a crack on her nose, and the cream made that area sore.  She has had shingles twice in the past.  The only place that she has the rash is on her neck upward, her face and seems to be moving to her forehead.  The other day it was on the side, and now has moved to the entire forehead.   She wears wigs due to the alopecia and seems to be moving up under the wig.  She has scaly skin, and crusty skin.    He did not diagnose her with shingles, but had it written on his form.  She asked if she had shingles and he told her that the Pfizer one had some symptoms of shingles.  She has tried eliminating foods, using other problems, and has been taking Benadryl and it&#39;s not helping the reaction.  He told her to go home and wash her face and not to be put anything on it and that it might go away on it&#39;s own, but she has had it for 3 months now.    She was very slight near the eyes.  Her right eye has had two detached retina and a cataract repair as well, and is worried that if it goes into her eye that she will be blind.  The rash is on both sides of her face not one sided.  She has put  cocoa butter cream on her lips and it seems to be helping her, but was told not to use it.  Told her to wash her face frequently and has an APT in a month to  have the patch biopsy.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 26Jan2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, Single Dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Von willebrand&#39;s disease Von Willebrand syndrome and Glanzmann&#39;s disease and allergies. Family history included bleeding disorder. She was poisoned by pesticides and formaldehyde years ago and they burned her entire respiratory system. There were no concomitant medications. The patient never had a reaction to a vaccine. No vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations were given within 4 weeks and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. On an unspecified date of Feb2021, the patient experienced lips tingling, face red which felt like swollen, tongue started to tingle, her face felt tight. The events lasted about 1- 2 hours. Patient wanted to know; can she take a Benadryl before the vaccine. The second dose is due on 16Feb2021 so the first dose was 3 weeks before that one was due. After getting the shot, her lips started to tingle, tongue started to tingle, and her face felt real tight. When the nurse came out to check on her, she was told by the nurse her face was really red. The nurse was going to get an EpiPen and wanted to call EMS. The reporter states she told her to just give her a Benadryl, she normally has them in her car but had run out. Patient stated she was allergic to everything. Anything coming in contact with her respiratory system such as hair spray, scents, any chemical causes her problems. The patient explained that she was re-reading the information about telling the vaccination provider about medication conditions including allergies and bleeding disorder, both of which she has. She was concerned about getting the second dose. She wants to know if the first dose will offer any protection. She had the first dose of the covid shot on 26Jan2021. She started feeling funny. The patient called the nurse and reports her lips were tingling and her tongue was starting to tingle. Her face was really red. Her face felt like it had pressure like it was blowing up but it did not feel swollen, it was tomato red. The patient queried if she does not get the second dose what will that do. She knows there needs to be given a certain amount of time between the doses. She heard on the tv that it can be given up to 45 days and still be effective. She heard all kinds of information, she heard that someone should get the second dose within 28 days and the paperwork states something different. Asked if her reaction will be worse with second shot. She was supposed to go back on 16Feb2021 for the second dose. Patient stated she took Benadryl after her reaction from the vaccine. She wanted to know if this affects the vaccine. Patient mentioned the fact sheet states that patients should tell the vaccination provider if they have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. She states she has a bleeding disorder. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. She took a Benadryl for treatment. The outcome of the event was resolved on an unspecified date of Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

A 79-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 (at the age of 79-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and liraglutide (VICTOZA), via an unspecified route of administration from 10Feb2021 to an unspecified date at unknown dose, weekly for an unspecified indication. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that everything was going fine until she had her COVID-19 vaccine on 09Feb2021, and then on 10Feb2021 she had the liraglutide injection. That&#39;s when everything went wrong and had to be hospitalized. She is losing her magnesium and her potassium. She had diarrhea, hadn&#39;t eaten in 5 weeks, was throwing up, and lost weight. She just can&#39;t eat, everything tasted so bland. She is getting better now though. The action taken for liraglutide was unknown. The outcome of the events was recovering. No follow-up attempts are possible; information about the lot number cannot be obtained.

It is a purple eggplant in color.; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 28Feb2021 10:20, as single dose, for Covid protection, at the hospital. Medical history included atrial fibrillation and ablation. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation and to prevent stroke from 2019. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 28Feb2021 and was scheduled to get the second dose on 21Mar2021 (Sunday). On 12Mar2021, her left eye was black, it was a purple eggplant in color. She wondered if she needed to tell the doctor and remembered her mother had blood vessel that burst. The patient clarified that it was to the side of her eye and not in her eye. It was bleeding under her eye. The nurse wanted the patient to stay so she could do some research. The nurse told her that the Pfizer vaccine caused the bleeding around the eye. The patient didn&#39;t want to have the second dose of the vaccine. She was told that she needed to report it. The nurse also told her that she needed to have her blood levels checked and that she does not need to take the second dose until she gets her blood levels checked. She went to her doctor&#39;s office but her primary care doctor and the other doctor were on vacation. She was seen by the nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner told her that she had to take the second shot and she might have to come off the blood thinner. She underwent blood work on an unspecified date with unknown results. She was told that the nurse practitioner has to study up on this and might have to come off of the blood thinner in order to get the second dose. She has been on blood thinner since 2019 after having an ablation. She has done wonderful. She is on this to prevent a stroke. She is on Eliquis. She is thankful for it. She has gone in and out of atrial fibrillation while taking Eliquis. The patient didn&#39;t want to take a chance on the second dose of the vaccine in case of hemorrhaging and was scared to take the second dose. Her blood clotting time was checked on 17Mar2021 and her prothrombin time was 16.2 seconds (standard: 11.9-14.5 seconds). She was hoping that Pfizer could advise her on taking the second dose. She thinks she will cancel her appointment for 21Mar2021. She is afraid to have the vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Pfizer vaccine caused the bleeding around the eye/bleeding under her eye&#34; and &#34;Black eye/left eye was black. It is a purple eggplant in color&#34; was not recovered; and &#34;prothrombin time was 16.2 seconds (standard: 11.9-14.5 seconds)&#34; was unknown.

                                                I had a delayed response to Covid 19 vaccine by one week, March 13th 2021. I had a bright red rash on hand, thighs, buttocks, with small blisters in between fingers and inside upper and lower lips. Also, had hives, welts, and swelling of these areas. Severe itching that did not subside. On March 14th I went to urgent care, by Tuesday March 16th it was worse, went to see Doctor and she increased Pepcid and prednisone dosage that I was given at urgent care. She increased my Zyrtec that I was taking from home and added Singulair. She did labs at this time. I was much better the week of March 21st and advised to see an allergist. Saw him on March 23rd, and he advised no more vaccines until her could test me. So far, April 1st there is no Pfizer vaccine available for test. I&#39;m making another virtual appointment for April 20th.

She reported tiredness; eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see; excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand; She couldn&#39;t move her fingers. She also mentioned red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site. She reported she had absolutely no symptoms, nothing after the Pfizer Covid Vaccine other than tiredness, feeling kind of tired, that&#39;s about it. On27May2021 in the afternoon she had onset of her eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes. She washed her eyes out, and the burning and watering went away after she washed them. She had no make-up on, no eye make-up on for a few days at that time. Otherwise, everything was ok. She went to bed last night and during the night she woke up with excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand. She couldn&#39;t move her fingers for maybe a minute or two. Eventually she was able to move her fingers a little, then more and more and the event stopped, she kind of went back to normal and fell asleep. A couple of hours later she had the same event reoccur, just down to the hand, all 10 fingers, couldn&#39;t move them for a few minutes and then after that she could, they seemed to be ok, and she fell asleep again. Whether event started 27May2021 or 28May2021 is unknown, unknown onset times. She has been fined all day. She has written checks out, made meals, coffee, washed and dressed herself, had no other problems. At her age it was hard to tell when the tiredness started regarding time of onset. Thinks in the evening of 24May2021 she felt onset, tired and the next day on 25May2021 she had a couple episodes where her arms felt really heavy just for a short time maybe 30 seconds and then the episodes went away and she just felt tired. 26May2021 she noticed she was not as tired, and yesterday and today improved, feeling pretty good. Seriousness of all the events was not specified by reporter. The outcome of the events eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes was recovered on 27May2021. Time of onset: late morning, probably about 11:00-11:30 really burned, then eyes started to really, really water. She was familiar with her house so she held onto furniture to get to the bathroom and as soon as she rinsed her eyes out event never happened again. Her eyes are not bothering her.The outcome of excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the event tiredness and red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site was recovering.  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on close temporal association the causal association between the reported event she almost could not see for a few minutes with the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The contributory effect of the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications also need to be considered. The case will be reassessed should the additional information is available.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: unknown) via unspecified route of administration in arm left on 06Mar2021at 11:00 (at the age of 79-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Patient previously received flu vaccine in 2009 for immunization and had a reaction. She had the Flu vaccine for many years and the one she had trouble with was a vaccine without preservatives. On 06Mar2021, seven hours after receiving first dose of vaccination, in the evening patient noticed that her mouth started to burn, accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. On 12Mar2021, patient experienced sinus issues. On 20Mar2021, patient experienced that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. On 22Mar2021, patient experienced burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area, which caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. On an unspecified date in 2021, patient experienced hypersensitivity reaction. Patient stated that when she was changing her outfit she accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. About 7 hours after, she noticed that her mouth started to burn. She mentioned that she also had pineapple that day and was not sure if it was caused by the vaccine. On the 09Mar2021, she consulted a nurse practitioner who said that the burning may have been caused by the Pineapple. On 10Mar2021, she consulted her allergologist and got tested for a pineapple allergy. The results came in on 15Mar2021 and they came back negative for the allergy, but her allergologist mentioned that pineapple can still irritate the mouth. On 18Mar2021, she consulted with her Primary in which she was given magic mouthwash that made it worse. She was made to continue her benadryl and aspirin spray. On 20Mar2021, that Saturday night, as she was walking, she felt that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. It lasted for about 20-30 minutes before subsiding. Last Monday, 22Mar2021 she really started to notice the burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area. She described it as not constant but comes and goes. On 25Mar2021, she consulted with her primary again in which she was recommended not to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine and her side effects lean to a more neurologic cause. The doctor mentioned that the vaccine was still too new. These side effects has caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. She said that has not been fun. it has been horrible, and she would choose dying over this burning sensation in the mouth. Patient visited physician Office, 3 times and allergist did it virtually. Reportedly, after eating dinner she was eating pineapple from a can. She had the can and tried it. She had not had pineapple in a long time. While sitting in her recliner, she experienced her mouth burning. She added that began about an hour and a half after eating the pineapple and it has lasted for approximately 2 weeks. It was not constant all the time. She did not know at the time if the burning in the mouth was related to the pineapple. Caller added they thought it was the pineapple causing this. Last Sunday, the caller indicated that it was leaving and going away. Caller saw her new primary medical doctor on 09Mar2021. The Nurse Practitioner said it was probably the pineapple, She started her on Benadryl. Manufacturer was unknown to caller. Caller took 2 tablets on 09Mar2021 and stopped taking it on 10Mar2021. She restarted taking the Benadryl on about 14Mar2021. Caller stated she was primarily calling and asking because on Monday, 22Mar2021 she started having burning in her face and had burning in her arm.  Caller reported the burning in her arm was not from the vaccine and she thought it was caused by her blood pressure cuff.  Caller took her own blood pressure. Burning was better today, she still had burning in her arm. She took Zyrtec as instructed by her physician twice a day. She took a half tablet on 10Mar2021 through 13Mar2021. She was taking half a tablet in the morning and a half tablet at bedtime. Caller added that the Zyrtec made her feel unsteady and it made her sleepy. She did not tolerate it. Dose was 10mg. She has recovered completely from unsteady and being sleepy with Zyrtec. Caller took Tylenol because she was having sinus issues. She did not have the manufacturer, she took it on 12 and 20, two times. Its 325mg, by mouth, the regular strength. Caller saw an allergist on 10Mar2021 who tested her for pineapple allergy. The Allergist called on 15Mar2021 and reported she was not allergic to pineapple. Allergy was also tested for egg white, milk, wheat, corn, peanut, soybean, potato, yeast, and tomato. All resulted as negative. Benadryl: took 2 times in 09Mar2021. Caller restarted Benadryl and took it on 14Mar2021-17Mar2021. These days she only took it in the evening. She took 25 mg at night. Then she took Flonase, twice, on the 17th and 18th. Its over the counter. Lot number: TE8G, caller doesnt have box to provide UPC, stated there was another number of 0140592, expiry Mar2021. Dose was 27.5mcg per spray, spray into each nostril. When providing strength, states writing was so small for her to see. Gets a magnifying glass to confirm strength, states it&#39;s with her age. The doctor also suggested for the caller to try Afrin spray on 18Mar2021.  Caller started it on 20Mar2021 and used it only once. She didnt like it. Caller said at her age she occasionally breaks out and uses Clindamycin for that. Dermatologist has her using Clindamycin 1 per cent pledgets. Applied twice to face once daily, She stopped 20Mar2021. Given Magic Mouthwash, which was in a pharmacy bottle, she took it once on 18Mar2021, but stopped. It was 5-10ml swish and spit. It made things worse and did not improve it. The doctor forgot to give her a measuring cup, and caller thought she told her a teaspoon. Caller added she tried using a warm cloth on her sinus area and her skin felt like a sunburn. The cloth left a red area around her cheek. Then this Sunday, after using the pledgets, went for a walk, next day noticed her face was really burned, not just face, her neck, arms, but she was not exposed, but had a burning pain, and she still continued to have it.  She asked the dermatologist if this could be caused from the Clindamycin. The dermatologist told her no. She took a walk on Saturday and did not know if she was dehydrated.  She felt like there were weights on her feet as she walked. It lasted 30 minutes. The burning in mouth started 7 hours after the first dose and it had improved. Therapeutic measures taken in response to the events included Benadryl, Zyrtec, Tylenol, Flonase, Afrin spray, clindamycin, magic mouthwash. Outcome of the events &#34;mouth started to burn/burning in mouth&#34; and &#34;sinus issues&#34; were ongoing-not recovered and for all other events were unknown at the time of report.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 30Jan2021(at the age of 79-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) If applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s) was none. Family medical history relevant to AE(s) was none and she is getting close to obesity if she keeps eating like this. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 11Jan2021, (Lot Number: EK9231, Expiry Date: Unknown, this is not on the CDC vaccine record card) via Injection administered in Arm Left for covid-19 immunisation and experienced Left arm was real sore after first dose injection. The historical vaccine included shingles vaccine. The patient experienced blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg on 20Feb2021 felt chills/chills on 31Jan2021, felt yucky on 31Jan2021, not walking well on 20Feb2021 , felt sick/sick as a dog on 20Feb2021, feeling nauseous on 20Feb2021, threw up like crazy on 20Feb2021, funny feeling around her head/feeling really funny on 20Feb2021, face usually gets red when her blood pressure is high and it she is not red at this time on 20Feb2021, vertigo on 20Feb2021, felt the really funny feeling going up her throat on an unspecified date in 2021, her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual on an unspecified date in 2021 and her balance was not quite right on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 220/110 mmHg (normal value: 120/80) on 20Feb2021, computerised tomogram: doctor mentioned 3 little places on 20Feb2021, electrocardiogram: unknown results on 20Feb2021, heart rate: little higher than usual on an unspecified date in 2021, laboratory test: unknown results on 20Feb2021. Patient received both dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. On the next day after the 2nd dose, she felt chills. On 20Feb2021, she started not walking well, thought she would fall. All of a sudden, she felt sick and threw up like crazy while she was visiting her daughter for the day. The firefighters came to take her blood pressure and it was up to 210/110 mmHg. They advised her to go to the ER. After several hours, she was given blood pressure and nausea pills. They mentioned vertigo. She says it got okay. However, 2 weeks ago, she started to have a funny feeling around her head. Not dizzy but her face usually gets red when her blood pressure high and she was not red at that time. It was again reported that the day after she was administered the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had chills and felt yucky that day. She also reported feeling really funny since 20Feb2021. She was asked for further information on events related to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She was at her daughter and noticed her balance was not quite right. She started feeling really funny so just lay down there for a little bit. When she did get up after about 15 minutes she started feeling nauseous. She got to the bathroom really fast and threw up like crazy. She did not have her blood pressure cuff with her so her daughter called the fire department and took her down there real fast. At the fire station they took her blood pressure which was 210/110 mmHg, so they suggested she head to the emergency room so she did. She was under observation in the emergency room, but not admitted to the hospital. The doctor mentioned vertigo somewhere along the way before she left the emergency room. She just kind of brushed the vertigo off until she was reading about that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can cause vertigo. She guesses vertigo was what caused these events because she had been sick as a dog. When they got her on the bed and rolled her back she felt like she was going 90 miles per hour and by the time they got her back on the bed she was throwing up again-but this time and the initial onset of throwing up was the only times she threw up. They gave her something after probably 5-6 hours, blood pressure medicine and nausea medicine and she got ok and left there. Her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual. About 2 weeks ago she was just sitting on the couch and noticed especially when she would turn her head she still feels really funny; not dizzy, dizzy; she was walking ok; but the really funny feeling keeps hitting her continuously. During call when she sat back down she felt the really funny feeling going up her throat. It was just the weirdest thing, she wishes she had a word to really explain what the really funny feeling was but she does not. She has not checked her blood pressure for a while because she has been holding for a while for this department, so her blood pressure could be up a little bit, but she stated event was worse right now than it has been. Regarding testing/investigations while in the emergency room they did a CT head scan, lab tests, and an EKG. CT head scan results, the doctor mentioned 3 little places but when she talked to her doctor he said that was really just nothing to worry about with age; he said they will check it in 6 months and make sure areas are not growing. Caller has no further information to provide regarding lab tests or EKG results, they did not mention anything. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg and feeling nauseous. The outcome of the events, felt chills/Chills , Felt yucky, her balance was not quite right, felt sick/sick as a dog, threw up like crazy, face usually gets red when her blood pressure is high and it she is not red at this time, felt the really funny feeling going up her throat, Her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual was reported as unknown, not walking well, feeling nauseous and vertigo was reported as recovering, funny feeling around her head/Feeling really funny and blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg was reported as not resolved.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

After the first dose she complained of visual disturbance which affected her sight, she was losing her vision on 27Feb2021 which went away after 1 month. Patient proceeded to take the second dose, and since has had the same visual disturbance from the previous dose, but this time it has not gone away. The patient received the first dose on 23Feb2021 and on 27Feb2021 the patients vision became distorted. Reporter stated she has seen 3 specialists and was now calling to find out if this side effect has been reported. The patient had been seeing an Ophthalmologist. Then about 20Mar2021 or 21Mar2021, the patient was on bromfenac sodium (PROLENSA), which was like an ibuprofen for the eye, her vision came back. A few days later the patient took the second dose of the vaccine and its 3 months and no vision came back. The patients vision has worsened since March. The patients vision went blurry on 27Feb2021 after the first vaccine and now she was losing her vision completely. The reporter wanted to know what he can do to keep the patient from going blind.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1687), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 80 years, on 29Jan2021 17:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cataract, arthritis and seasonal allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications.The patient stated that a couple of times she did not feel good and got very sore and could not bend over to pick things up and her eyes blurred up. After she got the shot, she gradually noticed aches all over and back pain. It was stated it hurt really bad in her back on the right side on the bone and she used the heating pad on it. Then the next day she was stiffer than ever and she couldn&#39;t bend over. She added her eyes were blurry, they felt like she had a cold in them, and she felt pressure in them. She added she always has this problem with her eyes but it got a little worse after the shot. All of that has gotten better now. It was stated they are telling her the second dose was worse and she was unsure about getting the second dose. Also mentioned they were saying you can wait a little longer and she was unsure if maybe she should wait. She wanted to ask about getting the second dose. She added she was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 19Feb2021. The patient said it was right sided back pain. She said she applied heading pad and took ibuprofen. She also experienced &#34;eye pressure&#34; and &#34;blurry eyes&#34;, &#34;how you feel when you have a bad head cold&#34;. She said, &#34;I have allergies-seasonal, so this isn&#39;t new to me&#34;.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of back pain (back pain). The outcome of the events did not feel good, eyes were blurry/ she felt pressure in them and  bad head cold was unknown while other events were recovered on 31Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

                                                On Saturday, February 13, I began to experience severe headaches for a week, and then excruciating pain in my temples and under my chin when biting into a sandwich and chewing food.  On February 23, I visited my Dr. and he said he could not give me anything for the pain because it would affect the antibodies.  On March 2, I visited my internist, Dr.  He did a SED test and found excessive inflammation.  On Saturday, March 6, I woke up with lost vision.  Was sent for an MRI at the Hospital.  Entered  the Hospital that night and was given 1 gram of IV solumedrol for 4 days.   Biopsy was positive for GCA.  I am on100 mg of Prednizone daily and have been referred to a neuroopthalmologist.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

I went home and was in bed for 2 days. Since then I have a sick headache on left side, and blurred vision, the fatigue is terrible and I am dizzy, I don?t feel like I have my balance. I?ve been to 4 specialists since then with numerous tests, but no one has an answer.

She passed out and didn&#39;t remember falling or feeling anything before falling. The patient also has a primary physician, but she had been seeing the plastic surgeon for this. The patient asked what does she do if she needs to get a booster. It scared her to death if she would have to take another shot. The patient asked (name) to hand her a pair of glasses to read the plastic surgeons name. She stated the printing is so small on there. She was supposed to see the doctor on 19Apr2021, but she didn&#39;t feel good enough to go see the doctor. For busted Mouth, they put in 3 layers of stitches. The stiches have been giving her a fit because sometimes they come undone and hang down. She had to go back into him and get them cut out twice, and she had another one from last night (18Apr2021). It is very sore. States the stiches inside the lip have not resolved and it was still hard. One part of her lip is soft and one part is hard. It was all hard in the beginning. The stitches on the inside are supposed to dissolve. For right Knee it was very sore and she can&#39;t hardly use it. For left shoulder it is very sore and she can&#39;t hardly use it. It made it awkward to get in and out of bed when she can&#39;t use her left arm or her right knee. Her left shoulder was really bothering her and she may have to go have some more work done. It has been popping and went in and out of the joint. That would be back with her primary doctor. Sore pinky on left hand had recovered it didn&#39;t stay that long.

Three days after that, on 1/29/2021, I became quite ill.  I had sudden onset of total body weakness, I was unable to sleep for 4 days, I developed a constant frontal headache, I felt like my body was electrified, my eyes started twitching and feeling like my eyelids were being pulled, my face felt like it was being pulled on one side, my nose became runny and hasn&#39;t stopped.   To this day I have no energy and am not like my old self before the shot.  I have gone downhill incredibly fast.  My doctors don&#39;t know what to do with me and I don&#39;t think things are going to get better.  My day to day life is a struggle.  I have no energy to do things.    One of the only things I have not had is a fever.    My eye doctor told me he thinks I had a GROSS IMMUNE SYSTEM REACTION to the vaccine.   0 I would appreciate it if there is anything you can do to help me.    Thank you,

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

A 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Deltoid on 22Jan2021 (Lot Number: EK9231) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. She had the first one 22Jan2021 and after that (22Jan2021) she had just a slight smell but it was so horrible. She thought that it was the blanket on the bed and she had passed it off a little bit. When she had her first shot she had mild side effects and then the next morning she could eat a little bit. After her first COVID vaccine she only had the horrible smell. That episode was short and by the next morning she didn&#39;t have the smell anymore. The event was reported as medically significant. The outcome of the event was recovered on 23Jan2021. The reporter considered the causality was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event parosmia and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.

Was seen by her primary MD and given antibiotics for presumed facial cellulitis (clindamycin and cephalexin). The facial swelling improved but then her right eye became red with worsened vision (3 days prior to presenting to ophthalmology). Exam found new onset of inflammation of the conjunctiva and all internal structures (panophthalmitis). She is a long-time patient at the eye clinic since 1993 and has never had inflammation in either eye prior to this episode. There is no other explanation for the sudden presentation of an acute inflammatory condition.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), in Feb2021 (Lot not reported) as 1 st dose, single then on 18Mar2021 (Lot not reported) as 2 nd dose, single; both intramuscular (at the age of 80-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since vaccination, patient was not tested for COVID-19. Medical history included neoplasm malignant. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reported adverse event was complete unilateral hearing loss right ear on 27Mar2021. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received were PET-scan (in 2021), MRI (in 2021), hearing test (in 2021), antibiotics and prednisone. The outcome of the event was recovered with sequel in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available a causal relationship between event unilateral hearing loss right ear and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded.

Inside of mouth no longer burning ,   Swelling in lips has gone down, they have been peeling for days.  Lips are red, still sore, but I&#39;m hoping they are done peeling. I really don&#39;t feel I can handle another shot of this vaccine.   I think I may have to cancel the second shot.  I don&#39;t know what is it it, everyone keeps telling me it has no penicillin or sulfa drugs in it, but the symptoms are the same.  The only difference is my hands haven&#39;t cracked and peeled along with my lips and mouth.  I&#39;ve had these problems since last tuesday night and am taking Benadryl trying to get some relief from it still.  Please let me know if you have any solutions to prevent this.

Consulted her dentist and as per consumer &#34;no abscess, so no cause or no reason for the bleeding. The bleeding also stopped.&#34; After her second dose, her right eye were swollen that made it look like a black eye. Asked consumer if patient has bleeding disorder to taking anticoagulant. She said no. Asking if we have any other reports just like this. Response: Told the consumer we don&#39;t have reports just like these and will be escalating her request. She wants to be contacted via email. Reporter is a Nurse Practitioner. Reporter is calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter is calling on behalf of a patient who she seen today.

Reporter stated that it was quite swollen and black, and looked like patient got punched in the eye. Today, at patient office visit, patient only had faint faint bruising at her eye. Seriousness criteria: Not provided. Indication: Because of patient&#39;s family. Patient&#39;s adult children wanted her to get it so they could come and visit her.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1284; Expiry Date: 30Apr2021) on 14Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE in the right arm for covid-19 immunisation, so she did not get the virus.  Medical history included Inflammatory bowel disease. There were no concomitant medications. she was allergic to Sulfa. She had no sleep the first night on 14Jan2021. The next day on 15Jan2021 she had a fever. Her temperature was 99.8 then later that day it was 103. She took an Aspirin. Friday night on 15Jan2021, she slept alright but sweat some, which was pretty normal. Saturday morning on 16Jan2021, her temperature was fine but she starred to get blurred vision like a migraine. She took another Aspirin and it went away. Later that day her temperature was normal at 97.2. She was a pretty active person. After she had the shot around 8 AM-10 AM in the morning, at 12 or 1230 she went out and took down her Christmas lights and she thought she felt good so she was going to trim her plants and she wondered if that had anything to do with her adverse events. Her arm did not hurt or anything. She is wondering if her activity had anything to do with disrupting the medicine? She was using that arm a lot, she probably should not have done it. She will not do it again. The outcome of Starred to get blurred vision like a migraine was recovered on 16Jan2021, of other events were recovered on 15Jan2021.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 15:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included wrist had arthritis (pain). There were no concomitant medications. Patient height was a little less than 5. She used to be over 5 but she shrunk. Her weight used to be at 226 lbs, it came up to 230. This year (2021) it went up because, its her, she ate too much and she did not obey the rules. Patient received Pfizer vaccine on 06Feb2021 afternoon at 300 pm in her left arm and that night developed itchiness, numbness and tingling in her fingers on the right side. Last night (07Feb2021) she unable to sleep the whole night as a result of lots of pain in her wrist and hand but especially thumb/wrist on the right side. she also reported swelling in her hand and was hardly able to bend her fingers. She tried to bend her fingers and she can but her wrist was swollen, it was less right now but she still had the pain. She applied muscle relaxant (unclear if topical) and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and massaged her hand with warm water and then for the second time she used the muscle relaxation. She hadn&#39;t taken paracetamol yet she was waiting 4 hours but the pain was still there, it was a little bit less. Not sure if it her arthritis or side effects from vaccine but believes it was from the vaccine. Stated she used to have the same problem with her wrist arthritis (pain). Also reported that she experienced additional side effects on 08Feb2021 which lasted about 5 minutes then went away: blurry eyes; wanting to faint; dizziness, sweating (whole body started to be like sweaty). Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing. She said at least she can write her hand was going back to a routine but she was in a lot of pain. Outcome of event wanting to faint/dizziness, blurry eyes, sweating was recovered on 08Feb2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020).

About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

She also noticed that her vision on her good eye became a little depleted which got her a little concerned and her body also became swollen and stated that she already gained about 3 pounds now.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

                                                double vision; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter). An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 81 years, administered in the arm on 09Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed from an unspecified date about 2 years ago but reporter was sure she had it before that. Patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. Patient historically took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot: EL3302) on 09Feb2021 at around 12:00, at age 81 years on the arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient had a reaction to Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine where double vision happened 2- 3 days after her second vaccination, but clarified that it was on 11Mar2021. The patient did not initially mentioned double vision to reporter herself, patient told her daughter last Saturday that she had been having double vision but reporter did not find out about it until later. The reporter took her to the doctor regarding the double vision and the doctor sent the patient to the hospital emergency room for double vision on 15Mar2021. Patient was not admitted to the hospital, was kept under observation in the emergency room where she had testing performed. While in the emergency room the patient had a CAT scan, and MRI and bloodwork and all of those tests results came back clear on 15Mar2021. The patient was released home from the emergency room after probably about 5-6 hours. The reporter just thought the double vision seems to be a little suspect being that she had had the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines and they have nothing else to attribute the event to. The vaccine was not administered at military facility. Outcome was not recovered at the time of reporting. Case was reported as non-serious.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EL9262, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 24Jan2021 at 12:15 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included monoclonal gammopathy, high blood pressure and cholesterol. Concomitant medications included Losartan and Metoprolol for high blood pressure and Lipitor for cholesterol which is under control with medication. Patient experienced dry mouth on 24Jan2021, tingling tongue on 26Jan2021. For the past 3 days the tingling was worse, then this morning it&#39;s better and dry mouth is about the same. Patient asked if her experience was a reported side effect of the vaccine. She replied she already spoke with HCP. She also asked if she could take Benadryl for the tingling on her tongue. She then indirectly questioned if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine after her reaction to the first dose. Patient also stated her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled on 12Feb2021, 19 days after the first dose. She asked is 19 days too early to receive the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. She is concerned because that is only 19 days. She is not sure if that&#39;s okay. Patient declined to write down Pfizer websites stating that she is not tech savvy as she is 81 years old, she prefers talking to someone. Outcome for Dry mouth was not recovered and recovering for tingling tongue.  Patient enquired about the timing of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Concomitant medications include: Losartan and Atenolol.  Vaccine was administered at approximately 5:00 pm at a drive through location.  The vaccination was administered by the County Health Department.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine (but while still at the facility), patient started experiencing a bulging of the right eyelid.  Patient did not immediately recognize that this may have been related to the vaccination. Over the next several days, patient started experiencing additional symptoms including drooping of right side of face, drooping of right eyelid, difficulty closing right eyelid and weakness on the right side of the face.  This was unusual and on 02/10/2021, patient contacted her primary care physician who referred her immediately to Emergency Department for evaluation.  The following tests and procedures were performed by the ER: Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC Hemogram, Troponin, eGFR and CT Head w/o Contrast (reason facial drooping).  Diagnosis: Bell&#39;s Palsy, Adult.  On 2/11/21, patient had a follow-up with primary care physician.  On 02/11/2021, the patient received prednisone (10 mg once daily for 5 days) as treatment for the Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The reported events required visit to Emergency Room on 02/10/2021 with follow-up at Physician&#39;s office on 02/11/2021.  Reporting is delayed because patient understood that the adverse event had already been reported.  At a later date, patient requested a copy of the adverse event report for her records but learned that the adverse event actually had not been reported.  Report is being filed by a contactable family member.

About 7 minutes after eating the bar, she went into a severe reaction and ended up in the emergency room and stayed overnight. thankfully was at work). Reported having shingles vaccination in 2014 and had shingles 2-3 weeks later, can&#39;t remember details. States it was a mild case. NDC, lot, expiry unknown. She stated every flu shot she received, she has gotten the flu and only takes periodically. States she retired in 2017 and had to take in 2016 and 2015, she would have lost her job if she didn&#39;t take. It had been 5-10 years before that, and another 5-10 years before that. States she stays away from the flu shot. Concomitant medications included metoprolol ER from Jan 2016 for atrial tachycardia, SYNTHROID started about 15 years ago for low thyroid hormone, Simvastatin ongoing, started about a year ago for cholesterol slightly elevated, OCUVITE PreserVision(Ongoing) taking about 3 years for macular degeneration age related has not changed or gotten worse in 3 years, baby aspirin started Jan 2016 (Ongoing) as cardiologist thought it would be a good idea, Vitamin D3: taking for 3 years (ongoing) for bone health, calcium with magnesium been taking a long time. 5-10 years to prevent osteoporosis (ongoing), glucosamine chondroitin taking since late 1990s. about 20 years for joint health (ongoing), multivitamin taking since 1995 or 1996. about 25 years for general health, vitamin C about 3 years ago started with the Ocuvite (eye doctor though it was a good idea to take together.   On April 28th2021 patient could not hear. She was deaf in right ear and the day before on April 27 it was like she woke up with pressure in both ears. It sounded like hell like she was in the airplane and by yawning she could not relieve the pressure and went to the doctor and was under treatment with steroids and antivirals and still deaf in right ear.&#34; She confirmed pressure is gone, but still deaf and under medical treatment with otolaryngology. She was kind of tossing whether to get the vaccine or not. First went to family doctor to see, didn&#39;t think she had an ear infection because no pain and was hoping maybe she would have wax in her ear, but ears were clean and no wax. So they sent her to an ear specialist and they did hearing test and she has pretty severe hearing loss in that ear. So she was still being treated. First the doctor put her on valacyclovir and methylprednisone for about 7 days and then that didn&#39;t seem to do anything and now she&#39;s getting dexamethasone injections into her middle ear. States she is due for one about lunch time. Pressure in both ears: patient reported has subsided, but then confirms it is a lasting effect comes and goes a little bit. Left ear is pretty much clear but right ear still has pressure and cannot hear and has not subsided. On an unknown date her equilibrium affected and stated has gotten slightly better, minuscule. Patient added she&#39;s pretty healthy and moves about, gardens takes care of business, goes to exercise class twice a week now partially participates because she gets dizzy from moving her head. Patient was treated with Valacyclovir: 1 gram tablet every 6 or 8 hours, states can&#39;t remember. Started 05MAY2021 for 7 days. Caller confirmed it did not help and she threw bottle away. Methylprednisone: 4 mg tablet by mouth started dose at every 4 or 5 hours, dose was a decreasing frequency of dose over 7 days. Confirmed she threw package away. Stated cortisone decreases irritation and inflammation. And Valacyclovir is an antiviral. Started dexamethasone injections last Thursday, 20 May 2021. Is scheduled to receive a dose today, will skip next week, and then one the following week, and then one the following week after that, states it is a series of four doses and then if that doesn&#39;t help she will have an MRI. Airborne: started taking about one week ago after first dexamethasone injection through tympanic membrane into middle ear. Relevant Tests: Hearing Test (Date: 05MAY2021)Result: pretty severe hearing loss in right ear, Test: Ear exam (Date: 03MAY2021; 05MAY2021) Result: Normal. Outcome for pain in extremity was recovered, for ear discomfort and deafness it was resolving, for hypoacusis and. equilibrium affected it was unknown.  Reporter seriousness for pressure in both ears and equilibrium affected: Medically significant, Deafness right ear: Disabling, Arm soreness: non-serious  Reporter causality: deafness in right ear: Causality: strong suspicion it&#39;s related to the vaccine, maybe not necessarily the vaccine itself, but her immune system reaction to the vaccine. Causality for pressure in both ear, arm soreness and equilibrium: related; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of  events such as deafness,balance disorder and ear discomfort cannot be totally excluded.

It did hurt and it was swollen, the neck. They gave her Tylenol and Benadryl. So, it does help her sleep but the next day, she was not so much hurting. Just had headache. On 17Jan2021, when she touched the back of her ear, it was tender and very sore. It was not as bad as it was. The first day (14Jan2021), she was feeling very tender on the gland. Those were not swollen. Lymphatic glands, those were the ones that got swollen on 14Jan2021. She would like you to know the main cause, they looked and told her it is normal for the lymphatic glands to get swollen after the vaccine. So, the patient guessed that is what she got but she still had a lot of soreness in the back of her neck. Outcome of the event events headache and neck pain was not recovered while unknown for other events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

This happens every night about one hour after sleep. I have no fever.   But I feel like I am in an oven.  Subsides about one hour later but extreme tinnitus continues.  During the day I feel hot but not the same intensity of the nightly attacks. Never had this before. I had a second shot on 2/26 and on that night it was very severe.  Still suffering to this date. Primary doctor does not know what I have.  Blood work negative except for two positive Ana antibody tests.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus. Outcome of the event dizziness was not recovered; outcome of the event unable to visually focus (visual disturbance) was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021; while room was spinning (spinning sensation) was recovered on 09Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.

                                                COVID Vaccine  I got my #2 Pfizer last Tuesday Apr 6....no problem at all with #1.  The vaccination was in my LEFT arm, and the 1st day or so I didn&#39;t really have anything but tiredness.  But the last few days have been very painful.  I developed swelling on the RIGHT side of my face starting at the temple. That progressed down to the ear area the next few days and was quite painful.   Since Saturday  my tongue, lips, gums became swollen resulting in barely being able to swallow. Also rash developed and is getting worse.  Additionally I ache all over and feel like a very bad case of the flu.  I tried Tylenol Extra Strength in the beginning, but that seemed to only ease the pain for about an hour.  Now I&#39;m  using  Advil, which helps for several hours.  Is there anything I can do to get relief.  This is the 8th day....and it seems to be getting worse instead of better.

An 82-year-old male received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch number: Unknown, ExpirationDate: Unknown) on 30Mar2021 via unspecified route of administration at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated the next morning she could not open her mouth, could not chew, face was hot and puffy, might have some fever also. She took a couple of Aleve, and it went away after couple of days. The patient stated she didn&#39;t know for sure if it was related to the Covid-19 vaccine or not. The day that she got the Covid-19 vaccine, later provided as 30Mar2021, she felt fine and never had a sore arm or fever. It was reported that it was almost like lockjaw, that she couldn&#39;t brush her teeth or chew. The patient reported that later in the day, the side of her face was all hot and might have been swollen and she took ibuprofen and that the inability to open her mouth went away in a couple of days. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient reported that she went to the chiropractor a couple of days later and the chiropractor said that he had heard about patients experiencing lockjaw after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and she looked on Pfizer&#39;s website and the AE she experienced was not listed as a side effect. She is just a little concerned as she is scheduled to receive her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine next week on 20Apr2021. She is afraid that the lockjaw might come back and might be worse. She is just curious if she is the only one that experienced the inability to open her mouth. The patient reported she does not know anyone that had this reaction and it is not listed as a side effect on Pfizer&#39;s website. The outcome of the event was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

It&#39;s more in my right arm and I cannot lift my arm when it&#39;s happening and it leaves me weak, trembling and in a cold sweat and sometimes I&#39;m real hot. In February I went to the hospital and 4 doctors looked at me, I stayed there one day overnight .  I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 29May2021 11:45 (at the age of 82-years-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included sensitive skin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available): None. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was reported as none. There were no relevant tests done. On 29May2021, the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. She had the worse reaction and didn&#39;t know what to do as she hedn&#39;t read about it and now she was reading it and added that she was not taking another one. She should have gone to the emergency room, but she was afraid they would admit her. She had read this paper on what she should, and she had almost every time. She went to her physician on 25May2021, and that they were giving the vaccine at his office and that it would be on the Friday (28May2021). Her physician had said that she needed to take the virus shot, but Friday (28May2021), it would be like to 12 o&#39;clock and she had been there on Tuesday for a physical. She said that they wanted her to make sure if she wasn&#39;t coming and reschedule. She said that she went to store on the following Saturday on 29May2021. After she got the shot, she sat there for 15 minutes and read a brochure and then stated that she had been there for 30 minutes. She was very warm that day and she went and did her little shopping and it was very hot. After she did all of the shopping that day (29May2021), she went somewhere else and when she did, she started feeling hot and it was hot outside and she thought she had better get out of the heat. She got home about 17:30. She got to feeling heat so bad and she sat on her porch which she always did before she goes in the house. She said later that day (29May2021), she started burning on left side of her head. Started burning like her head was on fire on left side of her forehead and it kept on. She had a sensitive skin, so she couldn&#39;t understand why it was burning so. She then stated that it was burning so bad she went to mirror to see what it was doing and added that the side of her forehead was red, like fire red, but it was &#34;kicking&#34;. Her son told her to put some cold compresses on it. She stated that she had been putting warm and that it had helped. The patient had rash forehead and she had put warm compresses on it and laid down because it was feeling so bad and she went back and looked in mirror and it had turned into fire and rash all across left side of forehead. She said she thought she must be having reaction to this shot. The patient stated that she loved coffee but hadn&#39;t even drank her coffee because she doesn&#39;t have any taste on 29May2021. She then looked at the information that was provided and the next day (on 30May2021), there was a big old sore like staph like someone had poured acid on her and for 2 days, she didn&#39;t put anything on her head to touch it. The patient considered the events feeling hot as serious and persisting, rash on nose as serious, rash all over the place as disabling, but then commented it was medically significant, nausea and vomiting had improved but was serious, eyes and face swollen up and pain on top of the forehead as very serious (even with her sitting, she could feel the pain arising on the left side), and sores on scalp and head as serious as serious. The patient experienced heat at night and added that it felt like something was hitting her on the side of her head. She tried to get some ease and she got and tried to eat some soup. She then went to the bathroom and threw up (confirmed it was on 01Jun2021). The patient was still having pain on the left side, top of forehead and added that it was &#34;shooting everything now and then&#34;. She then mentioned that it was coming back now. The patient then stated that it had been over a week and she was finally getting better. The patient stated that she wasn&#39;t going to the emergency room because they would want to admit her. She further stated that &#34;you could to the emergency room with a thumbtack and be put on Intensive Care Unit&#34; and reiterated that she wasn&#39;t going. The patient had rash in her hair and didn&#39;t want anything touching it as it was just painful and felt like a big old sore, like a scab. After two days on 31May2021, her eyes started swelling and almost shut the left. She applied Cortisone cream to rash on the 2nd day for one day only.  Doesn&#39;t not have it available.  No other treatment sought. The patient then stated that the rash, feeling hot, burning on left side of her head, rash on nose, pain at top of head shooting left side of face occurred later in the afternoon of 29May2021; while not provided for the other events. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room and/or physician office. The outcome of the events erythematous rash, nausea, and vomiting was recovering; for the events feeling hot, burning sensation, loss of taste, pain on top of the forehead/ pain at top of head shooting left side of face was not recovered; while for skin lesion, eyes swollen and swelling of face was unknown. The reporter considered the events to be related to the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

An 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), intramuscular on Left deltoid (upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 14:00 at single dose to prevent COVID. Medical history included sulfa drug reaction, high blood pressure diagnosed in 1970s or 1980s (States she was in the hospital in the 70s or 80s. She has high blood pressure which has been difficult to control, she is seeing a cardiologist and he is content with her blood pressure readings, her diastolic is normal), incontinence, thyroid nodule surgery a year ago (2020), thyroid nodule, ten operations in the last 3 years, tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery, scratchy throat problems since a week prior to getting the vaccine (from Jan2021) and post nasal drip and she has had that for years and when they operated nothing worked. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cipro where she could not breathe. She does not have lot, ndc or expiration date to provide for any of the medications mentioned that she had a reaction to. She took the Asiatic flu shot in 1958 (as reported), she had a reaction and high fever, weak and pale. This occurred when she was 19 years old. She took the Pfizer covid 19 shot last Wednesday. She stated that it could be her but she got a few of the reported side effects. What she found most important was that she had swollen lips that started about an hour after receiving the vaccine. Last night (13Jan2021) she got the chills and was shaking during the night. She had mild chills in the last few days, during the night she was shaking from the chills but it may have been cold at night, reporting the chills have subsided but she can feel it a little bit. In Jan2021, she felt a burning sensation in her left arm which lasted about two minutes. She got a piercing earache in her left ear for about two minutes and then it went away. She experienced nausea within two minutes, but she ate the ginger candy she had in her purse and her nausea went away. She could have something else too since she has a red dot on the inside of her throat. She did not see it was red before last night (13Jan2021). She took Benadryl on Wednesday afternoon after she called the doctor&#39;s office, she took the Benadryl thinking it was an allergic reaction, her swollen lips seemed like it was improved but now it was minor. She has had the tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery but she felt the tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, it is sort of still ongoing but states it has sort of improved. Patient also mentioned swelling on left side where the nodule was removed. She was asking if she should get the second dose. She has an appointment for her second dose. She has never had much problems till she was 80. Her husband tested negative for covid and she tested negative in Aug2020 prior to one of her surgeries. Patient stated that she is 83 but she is biologically younger. She felt pretty good normally. The events did not require emergency room visit or physician office visit. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the events burning sensation in her left arm, ear pain and nausea was recovered in Jan2021; Swollen lips, tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, chills was recovering; and unknown for the other events.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

She just had the two steroids, and she said she wanted to wait until Mar2021 until she considered getting immune therapy, but the nurse booked her for 26Feb2021, and she had her second vaccine from Pfizer scheduled on 19Feb2021 one week apart. She asked if that is too soon, and does she need to put off immune therapy again. She read it is 2-3 weeks between, she wanted to have this verified. Patient stated she supposed to take 6 steroids then 5 and so on. She took 2 pills then as she was reading information regarding the vaccine, she did not take anymore.  Last week is when she took the two steroids, she won&#39;t take them. She called a pharmacist, who said do not take them. The doctor&#39;s office, the nurse, gave them, after she told them she would have the vaccine. She stated she was furious, but she was getting this all the way down the line. She put the steroids away, she said she was not taking them, she talked to someone in the medical field and told her how she felt, and she agreed.  Patient asked if it will be ok to have the immune therapy at that time and soon after getting the vaccine if it would be effective. She mentioned that at her age she is more concerned that she gets that vaccine and she wants to delay having the immune therapy until March given the horrible reaction she had before. She tried and tried to have this conversation with her doctors, but she does not have all that technology and they are only offering remote appointments. Patient stated that she had no problems from the first dose of the vaccine stating she did not even feel the needle. She has been exactly an hour on the phone. The patient stated that she was losing her breathe after speaking at this time during the call on 05Feb2021. She also stated she is short of hearing (onset date unknown). Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Timing of these episodes are random, but seem to occur when she first gets up in the morning or after she takes a shower or has been active.  They lasts between 3 and 7 minutes and then completely resolve.  She has never had any similar symptoms.  She reports that these episodes occur between 4-6 times during the course of 24 hours.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

It was reported that two weeks later (19Feb2021), she had developed severe sudden onset hearing loss. The hearing loss occurred in both ears and that it has basically stayed the same. They have gone to the ENT and already had steroid injections. The patient was also prescribed Valtrex. The patient had finished the 10 day course of Valtrex that was prescribed just in case there were any viral or fungal issues causing the hearing loss. The patient has had 3 hearing tests performed and there has been no improvement in her hearing. The patient was scheduled for her 4th hearing test this week on 22Mar2021. The patient has had 3 rounds of steroid injections into her ears. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included hearing test: unknown result on 01Mar2021, hearing test: not improving, unchanged on 08Mar2021 and 15Mar2021 and magnetic resonance imaging: normal on 12Mar2021.

                                                A few days after receiving my second vaccine shot I lost my hearing. it was mostly in my right ear .  Went to Dr he gave me Afrin for 3 nights, flonaze during day and claritin.  After one week no improvement.  Went back and was given predzone for 10 days and went for a hearing test.  Test showed way below normal both ears.  Now have an appointment with an ENT specialist next week.  Ears seem to build up with pressure and noise and cause lightheadedness.

The Pharmacist had advised her to sit and wait 30 min. after the shot, due to her anaphylaxis history from multiple things. The Pharmacist monitored her and she continued to report itching on the forearm where she got the shot (not around the site) and slight shortness of breath. The patient never appeared to be in distress. As the symptoms continued, the Pharmacist decided, though an Epipen was ready to use, to call 911.  Paramedics arrived within 5 to 7 min., questioned her, took her BP, Oxygen level and listened to her breathing (all were good). She said she was feeling better and said &#34;no&#34; when they asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital. The paramedics stayed with her about 10 minutes longer and she left with her family. She did not receive any Epipen or Benadryl (is allergic to it) but wanted to take a box of Claritin 10 mg with her (said it always helps). The paramedic told her Claritin will not help anaphylaxis (for future). The patient was advised to contact her physician because she probably would be at high risk for a second Covid vaccine.

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Caller stated that she had no problem with smell. She said it was an insidious thing. She did not know when it happened. It was less than a month after 16Feb2021 when she had the second shot. They told her to go to Neurologist. She went to the Neurologist. He told her he did not think it was anything bad. He wanted an MRI to make sure it was not brain tumor. Caller said that she had a Micro Pacemaker inside. Caller said that taste had worsened. Coffee did not taste right, and it went on from there. Caller said the spot was on top of her leg.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Lot of pain right side of face like:  1.  toothache, whole jaw aches   2.  neck arthritis   3. sinus infection  4.  ear infection all at the same time.  Strong pain all through right side of face, sometimes up through eye.  Worse lying down.  Cause?   Dental exam complete mouth x-rays indicated no problems with any teeth.  Saw Dr. 3/3/2021, was checked for ear, sinus infections, felt all around my neck, no problems.  Prescribed gabapentin, told to continue the Tylenol Arthritis I had been taking on my own.  Symptoms continue today, only right side of face, head, temple area, sometimes up through right eye, teeth on right side ache.  Only take the Tylenol once a day since that is all that I need it.  More painful if I lie down in bed at night so sit upright until pain is gone; then sleep through the night.  No problem all during the day when I?m up and around doing whatever. . .no pain then.  Someone in my dental office has the same symptoms along with Bells Palsy, was told by her doctor it&#39;s from the Covid shot and could last 3 months? Pharmacist also told me filling the gabapentin for several others with same symptoms (I live in a small town).

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation; pyrimethamine (Tablet, Lot Number: AM0737A; Expiration Date: 31Jul2022) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg once daily for toxoplasmosis retinitis. Medical history included toxoplasmosis retinitis (eye infection toxoplasmal), vision loss (Blindness), and an allergy to sulfa medications. Concomitant products were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient had a second dose of the Covid vaccine. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 (over the last month of 01Mar2021), after starting the products, the patient had worsening vision loss (visual impairment) in her eye within one month of receipt of the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient felt the only thing that was new was she had just received the second dose of the Covid vaccine. As of 01Mar2021, the statuses of treatment with pyrimethamine and the worsening of vision loss in her eye were ongoing. An association with pyrimethamine cannot be ruled out. However, the event is confounded by toxoplasmosis retinitis, vision loss, and receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, which the reporter notes was the only new occurrence. The action taken in response to the events for pyrimethamine was dose not changed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of had worsening vision loss in her eye. The outcome of the events was unknown. The reported was considered as other serious (important medical events).  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EW0191) on 29May2021 (at age of 86-year-old) on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Asthma, ongoing degenerative osteoarthritis, ongoing Stent, COVID-19 from 15Jan2021, diarrhea. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet for pain. The patient previously took Plavix from unspecified date and ongoing. Caller states she is calling about the immunization, says she got it last Saturday in the afternoon (39May2021). She felt alright on Saturday, but from Sunday (30May2021) on, she began to have problems. Caller states she has advanced, degenerative osteoarthritis, and says it has been storming in Indiana this week. Caller states she has been in terrible pain, says she usually doesn&#39;t complain, and has been living with pain for years. Caller says she has to be pretty bad to complain. Sunday was really miserable with the arthritis. Caller says she is telling Pfizer not because she expects Pfizer to do anything with it, but says maybe she can help someone else who calls in because obviously she survived and the pain has gotten better through the week. Caller says Monday was another bad day, and she finally just had to give up and leave everything where it was and just go in the bed because she was hurting so bad. She clarifies she had to give up, says she tried to stay up but had to go back to bed because of the pain. Caller states her symptoms were an elevated temperature, which was a low grade one and still has it today, and she had GI symptoms. Caller states she and her grandson were running parallel, says they were both exposed at the same time, and both came down at the same day, and their symptoms were the same except her grandson does not have arthritis. Caller states they had a low grade temp, GI problems where they were not exactly nauseated, but it was kind of like a hunt. Some things went in their stomach and her stomach felt a little better with food in it, and then the problem was the diarrhea. Her and her grandson both had diarrhea and both slept quite a lot. Caller states she slept the clock around a couple of days. Caller stated both her and her grandson were hazy, mentally. The caller states she was surprised because her grandson is a very sharp young man, and he was sort of numb. When attempting to verify the details above and if her grandson also received the vaccine at the same time she did, the caller clarifies she is confusing things. She was talking about when they both had the COVID virus about the 15Jan. Caller says they were both exposed and came down with it the same day, says they ran parallel for 3-4 weeks. Caller confirms she is the only calling about herself today having received the vaccine. Caller states she is about 140 lbs, says she hasn&#39;t been very active lately. Caller states she received her vaccine at noon, says she was supposed to be there at 11, got lost getting there, waited in line, and then was ready at noon. Caller states they made her wait awhile longer because of her reactions to medications, says she waited a half of an hour. Caller states because felt it was wise for her to take the COVID-19 vaccine in lieu of her medical history with asthma, a stent, things like that. Caller says the doctors said it was wise for her to take it even though she had had the virus. She trusts , and has been with the doctor for 30 years, says she started with him when he first started his practice, says she trusts him, he&#39;s excellent, so when he said she should take it, she said ok. Caller states she didn&#39;t want to. Causality: Caller states she is inclined to think pain is related to the vaccine, but she is not going to say positively it was related, but it certainly is a coincidence. Caller states what she felt was that whatever was in the vaccine sort of irritated the irritation in her back and hips and leg and everything. Caller says they had some stormy weather this week and that always makes arthritis worse, but something caused the low grade fever. Caller states she is kind of assuming it&#39;s the COVID-19 vaccine. To be honest, she is kind of scared of the second dose so that&#39;s why she changed her appointment until the day after Father&#39;s day. Father&#39;s day will be the first time to see her entire family since the virus. Caller says her second dose was scheduled for the day before Father&#39;s day, but after the week she has had, she&#39;s going to get the immunization afterwards so she gets to see everybody. Caller then states she does feel the low-grade fever, and pain she was feeling, and the GI upset, were related to the vaccine. The GI upset was kind of a milder version of what she had when she had the virus. Caller states both she and her grandson had the GI upset when they had the virus. Caller says he wouldn&#39;t eat for awhile, but she got him to eat what she was eating because she figured out what her stomach would tolerate. Her and her grandson both had diarrhea and that was the bothersome part of it. After the vaccine, the caller did a lot of sleeping, says sleeping didn&#39;t last as long with the vaccine as it did with the virus. Caller says it was just a feeling of tiredness and she felt kind of blah. She really felt kind of stupid, it was hard to think- she doesn&#39;t know whether it was because she slept so much or what.  Caller states she does not take strong pain medications for her arthritis because she has a stent and is on Plavix 24/7. She was told two years ago there is an incidence of internal bleeding for people who take arthritis medication and those who have a stent and are on a blood thinner 24/7. Caller states she was given the option of either taking a chance or not to take the pain medication. Caller says she didn&#39;t take the chance and opted not to take the pain medication. Caller says she only takes Tylenol extra strength, she does not use anything else. Caller says it can&#39;t be a pain medication that made her sleepy and stuff. Terrible pain: Caller states that one day, she just gave up and went to bed because she hurt so bad. She is not sure she would say the pain is disabling. The pain began on Sunday. She was a mess when she woke up. She clarifies she might have been up through the night to go to the bathroom and was miserable. Sunday was miserable, and Monday was a miserable day. Elevated temperature: Caller states fever began in the night, says she can&#39;t remember whether it was Sunday night or during the day on Sunday, says she&#39;s not exactly sure when. When probed for the seriousness, she said the significance might be due to the immunization. She confirms the fever is getting better, she felt better yesterday. Caller says today her eyes are burning. She took her temperature earlier and it was up, and her temperature is still up. Caller states because she takes Tylenol morning and evening, before she goes to bed, says it helps the pain somewhat. Caller says the first part of the week, Monday and Tuesday, the Tylenol might have taken the edge off. Extra Strength Tylenol: 500 tablets per bottle, 500 mg per tablet. Caller states the NDC:3014256190. Caller says she doesn&#39;t see a lot number, but there is a number underneath the expiration date: 9EE2582B.Exp: Feb 2021. Caller states the pain today is about the same that it always is, says she&#39;s pretty much in pain all the time, says it&#39;s something she has to live with. Caller states about the only time she is pain free is when she&#39;s in bed and has relaxed and taken a dose of Tylenol and it has taken effect. Caller states after she gets up in the morning and starts moving around, she starts having pain. Sometimes she has pain early in the morning, depends on what she does, like run the sweeper or when she&#39;s getting groceries. Caller states getting her groceries are one of the worst things, and she will have more pain the next morning. GI upset symptoms: Caller says she&#39;s pretty sure it started Sunday or just right away after that. Caller says it&#39;s a strange feeling, it&#39;s kind of a queasy, hungry feeling, it&#39;s a weird feeling. Caller says she puts a little food down there and it helps. Caller says she&#39;s been eating a lot of crackers, wheat thins, and ginger snaps. Caller says she has eaten and is pretty comfortable, says she would say it&#39;s getting better. Caller states she thinks in general, she is getting better- it&#39;s not perfect, but she is getting better. Caller states the reason she called is, for instance, her daughter in law, the mother of her grandson, was tending to think his symptoms from the virus were psychological and so forth. Her daughter in law is sort of that way, and she thinks everybody&#39;s else pain is psychological but hers. Caller states she came to her grandson&#39;s defense and fixed him up three care packages over a month with food that her stomach would tolerate- like crackers, ginger snaps, powdered chicken noodle soup, not canned, and oddly enough canned green beans, just plain old green beans, nothing on them- she didn&#39;t even have to warm them. Caller says her stomach tolerated them. Also, baked beans helped, she needed protein in there, says she tolerated baked beans and so did her grandson. Caller can&#39;t say everything she put in the care package, but tea was one thing, and another thing was cocoa. Caller says she got a generic mix. She mentions she tried some others, but they were not that good which was also because her taste doesn&#39;t enjoy food. Caller states this cocoa was good and was the generic brand. She gave her grandson a couple of cans of that because she drank that every evening when she took her medicine and ate crackers with her medicine before bed, and it was kind of soothing to her stomach. She knows it sounds weird, but it worked. Her GI upset she would consider medically significant because there was definitely a tie up. She explains it wasn&#39;t disabling and she doesn&#39;t consider it serious. She explains it was annoying, especially when she had the diarrhea. Unable to determine if caller was referring to vaccine symptoms or virus symptoms. Tiredness: She states she would consider the tiredness medically significant because she would sit down and she would get sleepy and then she did all this sleeping. Caller states it wasn&#39;t serious. She states the whole thing about this virus is kind of annoying because it was just bad enough it kept her from functioning normally and kept her feeling kind of lousy. Caller states she is feeling better, says it&#39;s improving. Hard to think: Caller states she would also consider this medically significant. She wouldn&#39;t have driven, says she wasn&#39;t sharp enough to drive or do anything important. Caller states today she is a little tired, but her temperature is up- it all goes in together. Attempted to clarify symptoms of the vaccine with caller. Caller states one thing she wants to tell Pfizer about her grandson is about the mental fog. The caller and her son were very afraid her grandson had that because her grandson was just a blob sitting there. He has been depressed because his parents are in a custody battle, so she doesn&#39;t know what part that played in it. Caller says she was concerned about him. He is 15 and he is very intelligent, but his grades went to Ds and Fs. Caller says her son got ahold of the high school counselor and the mother wouldn&#39;t do anything about it. The high school counselor got in on it, her son got on it, then they got someone got on it. Caller says they got her grandson through the work he was behind on, says he was behind for the whole thing. His mother didn&#39;t encourage him to do any school work. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have done any good, maybe he was too far gone to do any work. Caller says they were concerned about the mental fog. She says her grandson is coming out of that and becoming his old self again. Caller says he is very intelligent and inquisitive, and he was just a blob for a long time. Medications: Caller stated she has been taking Plavix since 2008. She clarifies she started taking the Plavix because of her stent. She was on brand Plavix for a while and at one point she was switched to generic and she is on the generic 24/7. Tried to confirm with caller the generic name, but the call disconnected. Outbound call,was placed on 04Jun2021 at 3:24pm and was unsuccessful. Placed second outbound call, on 04Jun2021 at 3:25pm and was unsuccessful. The outcome of the events was unknown. The causality was reported as related. The seriousness was reported as medically significant.

                                                Patient developed dizziness and weakness. She did not totally pass out because she made it to her chair and did not fall on the ground. She described her vision going black. She said that she did not eat today at her normal times which could have contributed to the event. She is asking if the vaccine could have had anything to do with this?  She has not had a previous episode like this before. She did have some minor injection site pain at the time of the vaccine but that has subsided.  Follow-up call with patient on 1/30/31 at 19:37: Spoke to the patient. She is feeling better today.  She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

A 87-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 18Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication reported as unspecified (Caller states that she does take a few medications but nothing has changed with those in years, so she does not think anything else is relevant). Historical vaccine include flu shot and does have reactions. Caller stated she received Pfizer COVID shot first dose and within an hour she had migraine without the headache but did have the vision blocked out. It resolved after some time. she wanted to know the ingredient of the vaccine to see if she should take the second dose. Caller states that she had her first Pfizer COVID Shot on 18Jan2021. Caller states that she didn&#39;t have any of the ordinary reactions, both the caller and her husband had the shot and neither of them got a sore arm or swelling at the site. Caller states that after they stayed for a half an hour, and when they were driving back to, the caller started to get a migraine aura. Caller states that she has had them before, but not often, and she has not had one for about 10 years. So caller states that her aura started while they were driving, and then the caller&#39;s husband dropped the caller off at the grocery store. After being dropped off, caller states that her migraine came on strong. Caller states that her migraine was strong enough that she could not see, she was experiencing flashing lights, and blocked vision. Caller finally turned to another customer to ask if he could see the cucumbers in front of them. Caller states that she waited outside for her husband to get her. Caller states that migraine probably lasted for about 45 minutes. Caller is wondering if this could have been from the shot or not. Caller states that she does have reactions to flu shots sometimes, but not like this. Outcome of the events was recovered on 18Jan2021.

She also has blurry vision and swelling in her eyes. It felt like she had discomfort behind her eyes. It was causing difficultly reading. This lasted about 2 weeks.  It is not as blurry but her vision is not what it is was prior to receiving the vaccine. She went to Eye Center, they told her they didn&#39;t know what it was from. They gave her some eye drops and gave her antibiotic/steroid  cream. She has a follow up appointment 2/26/2021.

                                                On Tuesday, March 9th, a friend of mine went to my mother&#39;s home to take her to a scheduled dentist appointment. Upon arrival, she observed that my mother was disoriented and her vision was impaired. Specifically, her right pupil was completely off to the right side, her eye was irritated and slightly swollen. Per recommendation from the primary care office, my mother was taken to the emergency room. She remained hospitalized for two weeks during which time, several labs and x-rays were performed; several ideas surfaced regarding root cause including Miller Fisher Syndrome, mini-stroke, etc. but no final diagnosis was identified.

An 88-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 11:45 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung cancer. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient had unspecified other medication in two weeks. The reporter&#39;s mother&#39;s experienced mild allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she wants to know whether or not she should be getting her second dose. She will be asking her doctor as well as they were advised by the nurse administering the vaccine and also the doctor&#39;s nurses who observed her mother afterwards, but she was also advised to contact Pfizer.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn. Medical history included hiatus hernia surgery from Nov2019, surgery from an unknown date, vomited after surgery for three nights/days, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cancer, feet burning, feet red, asthma and thyroid. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), fluid pill, vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, acid reflux pill before nighttime before supper, thyroid pill, singulair pill. The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression..&#34; She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn&#39;t get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that&#39;s the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn&#39;t know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight. The action taken in response to the event for gabapentin was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event &#34;Pain in arm&#34; was recovering, the outcome of the event fatigue was not recovered, the outcome of the events &#34;temperature 99.2&#34; and &#34;Vomiting&#34; was recovered, and outcome of other events was unknown.
