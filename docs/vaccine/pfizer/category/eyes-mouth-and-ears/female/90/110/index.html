Medical history included osteoporosis from Aug2020, rash on her legs from Aug2020, (lower leg below the knee, she was using a steroid but she had stopped as she was told not to use it too often by her doctor and just use Vaseline to keep the skin moist. She was asked if she had used any steroids but she hadn&#39;t used it in the past week and maybe only once in the previous week but couldn&#39;t be certain it wasn&#39;t in the last 10 days. She resisted the urge to use Mometasone 0.01 as it damaged the skin.); allergies to Sulfa a few years before. The patient reported her daughter who died at 41 years old of breast cancer. There were no concomitant medications. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.The patient previously took brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate (COMBIGAN) a few years before and experienced allergies, the eye drops didn&#39;t her any good at all and was told not to use it anymore. She previously received flu shot most every year and never had a problem. She stated that evening on 19Jan2021 she felt fine and then the next morning on 20Jan2021 she experienced tingling around the mouth area and lips. Almost as though her mouth or lips were moving in a way that she had no control over. She looked in the mirror and saw no evidence of it moving but could feel it moving. It was just a feeling she was having. The feeling was about the same. The first 2 days was on just the right side but she has had now had 2 occasions where it was on the left side. This was not constant, just occasionally during the day. She wanted to know if this was a known side effect and will it go away. She wanted to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine considering these side effects.The outcome of the events was not resolved.

She was drooling and staring vacantly and was not responding to questions. This lasted for a bit. I called the ambulance which took her to the  hospital. They hydrated her and sent her home with no idea what caused it. The next day she was sitting on the toilet and passed out with her eyes closed. She started drooling. I again called the EMTs and they came. She had come to and they said she fainted and it was probably because she was having a bowel movement. This has not happened before or since these two episodes. I do not know if she should get the next shot.

A 92-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm up at the top on 13Feb2021 at 10:00 or 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6200) (at age 92 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received shingles shot for immunization. The patient&#39;s son said that a week and a half after receiving the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, the patient developed shingles and severe pain. He wanted to know if his mother should still go ahead and receive the 2nd dose. If so, how long does she have to wait to receive it. He said his mother received the 1st dose on 13Feb2021, and was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 01Mar2021 or 10Mar2021. After the shot, a week and a half later (Feb2021), the patient got what the doctor thinks is shingles. The reporter and patient didn&#39;t know if she should get the second vaccine.  The shot was not given by her doctor or at his office. The patient was healthy before and she&#39;s in quite a bit of pain, should she get the next shot because she&#39;s worried about it.  The patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled already on 10Mar2021 but hasn&#39;t been able to get a hold of the place when calling them. The patient had the shot on 13Feb2021, on Monday 22Feb2021 the patient had sharp pain that would come and go behind her right ear. Patient stated she hates the pain. The patient had swelling in the lymph nodes behind her right ear a couple of days later. On 23Feb2021 the pain continued off and on behind the patient&#39;s right ear and she was having trouble sleeping. On 24Feb2021, the patient went to the doctor and he prescribed antibiotics because he wasn&#39;t sure that&#39;s what it was. There were no spots on the patient yet, the patient had more pain than before in the back, but she did not have a rash or swollen lymph nodes. The patient&#39;s lymph nodes were swollen in the back of her neck Thursday night (25Feb2021). The pain continued, it was more severe. The patient developed a rash on Thursday (25Feb2021). Friday the doctor prescribed the medicine for shingles. On 28Feb2021, the pain was radiating in her ear and behind there, you&#39;ll see her wince. The patient didn&#39;t get red blotches yet. Monday and Tuesday the pain was sharp, kind of sticks and then it was gone, it came and went, yesterday it was constant all day and Saturday it wasn&#39;t constant. Saturday the pain was constant. Thursday you could feel the knots in the lymph nodes, they have gone down some today. There is a little improvement in the patient&#39;s ear lymph node swelling. The patient has ear pain. The doctor looked in the patient&#39;s ear on Wednesday the 24th, the pain radiates, on the outside and the inside, it&#39;s just pain, shoots there and behind there. The pain has gotten worse over the week. The pain is intermittent, not constant and when it comes it&#39;s really sharp, she&#39;s had more over the weekend where its coming more often. The patient was having trouble sleeping starting Tuesday evening, it was fair but by Wednesday the trouble sleeping wasn&#39;t bad yet, the patient was still able to sleep, she has had to sleep sitting up, but by Wednesday, she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep well. The patient states that she has slept better now that she&#39;s on medication, last night was the first time she slept well. The shot was given in the left arm, all of this is on the right side. The patient has had no vaccines before, she wasn&#39;t sick before this. She still has the rash all over, the rash is behind the patient&#39;s ear, all down the back side of her neck, side of the neck, up into her hairline slightly, on the right side of her face, on her collar bone, and a little on her back. People say they got a bad case. No further clarification provided. Reports these are pretty big blotches (Feb2021). The rash was about the same, between Thursday, Friday and Saturday the patient developed more of them. With the rash, the reporter noticed more on Friday and Saturday. Today the rash is there but it has not changed. For her history, the reporter stated she&#39;s on normal medication, she didn&#39;t have anything before this. The patient is not in a nursing home, resides in her own home, not in a facility, she&#39;s is able bodied to stay at home. The patient is mentally alert, walks with a cane when needed, she does everything on her own.  The patient&#39;s doctor sent her for x-rays behind her right ear and face, facial, shoulder, and behind the ear area, behind the neck area on 24Feb2021. The patient&#39;s doctor&#39;s office called and said it showed arthritis. The reporter states that this pain is not from the arthritis. The caller mentions that the patient got a shingles shot, it was a one-time shot, and she did not have a reaction to it. The patient was having a hard time hearing, she is hard of hearing in one ear. The patient was recovering from trouble sleeping and swelling in the lymph nodes behind her right ear; not recovered ear pain and rash; while unknown for the rest of the events.

Patient had no previous history of immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The patient did not receive additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. His mother got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine two weeks ago 05Mar2021 at 10:00AM in the right arm. In about four hours after the vaccine, on 05Mar2021 her lips were swollen; they read that it is one of the known side effects. Then next day they went to the family doctor who prescribed Benadryl. She took it for about a week but her lips are still swollen. His mother told him she noticed her tongue has had a few cuts in it but he is unsure of the exact date. His mother is not in bad condition and but she did have a severe reaction. She is scheduled for the second shot next week 26Mar2021. They stopped the Benadryl a few days ago because they are planning to see a specialist in allergies and heard they might want to do some testing so he wanted his mother to be clear of the Benadryl. Not have any product or information to provide NDC, UPC, lot or expiration for the Benadryl his mother took. The events resulted in a visit to physician or ER: Monday they saw the family doctor who prescribed Benadryl for lips swollen.

                                                94 yo F presented from assist living with slur speech for 1 day, last seen well on 1/30. Pt has a PMH of dementia (Baseline, she will keep saying, &#34;help me, help me&#34;, AOX3, using walker, could go to bathroom by herself), hx breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy, chemo, Tamoxifen, currently not on tx), HTN, HLD, vaginal bleeding (no further work up by family), overactive bladder (on solifenacin), hx of MI (undocumented, no PCI or CABG), spine stimulator placed. According to patient&#39;s daughter, she saw her January 30, she was doing okay after the vaccine. On  1/31 when the daughter called her on the phone, she knows she has some slurred speech, when she saw patient in the facility, she noticed her gait becomes unsteady.  She decided to bring her to the hospital.  1/30, she noticed the patient has spilled up some water, otherwise denies fever, chills, shortness of breath, pain,  chronically, she has constipations taking laxative.  In the ED, pt was afebrile, 36.1, heart rate 85, blood pressure 130/61, respiratory rate 18, saturations 98 on room air.  Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA. However, she has significant risks for bleeding given recent vaginal bleeding (investigation not pursued to spare her comfort), age, comorbidities, etc. Again, further discussion between family and primary team is required regarding risks vs benefits. Was evaluated by speech-language pathology present minimal oral dysphagia no overt clinical signs of aspiration, recommended to continue with NDD 2 diet/thin liquid. Patient was discharged to ECF.

The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

                                                Two days after the shot, my mouth developed sores inside both lips, the lower lip was swollen. Inside lower lip blisters erupted.  From then the soreness spread into the floor of my mouth and under my tongue. It was difficult to eat as the food  would scrape the sore parts. I have been washing my mouth with Oragel  two or three times a day, and am now rinsing with salt water.  My lips are so dry I have to keep lip balm on them continuously.  Today feels a little better but still have soreness in parts of the mouth, and roof of mouth.  Am worried regarding the second shot due on the 26th.
