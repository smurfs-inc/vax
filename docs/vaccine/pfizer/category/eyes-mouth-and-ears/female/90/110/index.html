Medical history included osteoporosis from Aug2020, rash on her legs from Aug2020, (lower leg below the knee, she was using a steroid but she had stopped as she was told not to use it too often by her doctor and just use Vaseline to keep the skin moist. She was asked if she had used any steroids but she hadn&#39;t used it in the past week and maybe only once in the previous week but couldn&#39;t be certain it wasn&#39;t in the last 10 days. She resisted the urge to use Mometasone 0.01 as it damaged the skin.); allergies to Sulfa a few years before. The patient reported her daughter who died at 41 years old of breast cancer. There were no concomitant medications. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.The patient previously took brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate (COMBIGAN) a few years before and experienced allergies, the eye drops didn&#39;t her any good at all and was told not to use it anymore. She previously received flu shot most every year and never had a problem. She stated that evening on 19Jan2021 she felt fine and then the next morning on 20Jan2021 she experienced tingling around the mouth area and lips. Almost as though her mouth or lips were moving in a way that she had no control over. She looked in the mirror and saw no evidence of it moving but could feel it moving. It was just a feeling she was having. The feeling was about the same. The first 2 days was on just the right side but she has had now had 2 occasions where it was on the left side. This was not constant, just occasionally during the day. She wanted to know if this was a known side effect and will it go away. She wanted to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine considering these side effects.The outcome of the events was not resolved.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

                                                Two days after the shot, my mouth developed sores inside both lips, the lower lip was swollen. Inside lower lip blisters erupted.  From then the soreness spread into the floor of my mouth and under my tongue. It was difficult to eat as the food  would scrape the sore parts. I have been washing my mouth with Oragel  two or three times a day, and am now rinsing with salt water.  My lips are so dry I have to keep lip balm on them continuously.  Today feels a little better but still have soreness in parts of the mouth, and roof of mouth.  Am worried regarding the second shot due on the 26th.

At 12:00 pm, she complained of worsening fatigue and blurry vision.  At 3:40 pm, she complained of loss of appetite but denied fever and chills.  The niece was unable to reach her by phone after 4 pm, so she came over to the decedent?s residence at 6:15 pm to check on her.  The niece found her lying face up in bed ?gasping for air.?  She then became unresponsive and EMS was called.  The decedent was pronounced at 8:11 pm after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts.  Autopsy showed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with marked partially calcific coronary atherosclerosis; marked pulmonary edema; and pleural effusions.  The brain was saved for neuropathology given the history of blurry vision.
