                                                Angioedema; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (patient). A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1284, intramuscular in the right arm (also reported as right shoulder), first dose on 22Dec2020 00:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s relevant medical history included severe reaction to some animal dander and pollen, severe reactions to poison oak, possible drug induced reactions (unspecified) post C-section, mild rash with influenza vaccine this year (2020) (with no other hx of adverse reaction to a vaccine); had allergies to pollen, mold, some animals. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) and experienced rash. The patient had no covid prior vaccination nor was she tested post vaccination. Adverse event reported was angioedema on 24Dec2020 with outcome of recovering. Systems started appearing on 23Dec2020 evening with slight rash and fluid collection under right eye. Developed more rash on 24Dec2020. In the evening to early morning of 25Dec2020, symptoms worsened significantly. Rapid swelling to face occurred. Swelling was concentrated around eyes and cheeks the most. Both right and left side of the face and neck were affected. However, the right side face had a more pronounced reaction. MD ordered oral prednisone and Benadryl as treatment plan. Also, ordered episode-pen for a worst case scenario. Symptoms have been improving under treatment but still persist some. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse event start date was 24Dec2020 (as reported). The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event angioedema was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Around at 7AM when I arrived at work I started feeling chills, took temperature 99.5F that is already elevated for me.  About 9:30 my temp was 101.8F and they sent me home.  I just had the chills and fever.  I got home and developed a headache and around 1PM I started feeling really dizzy. The temperature did not subside and the next day I woke up and I couldn&#39;t function, I felt really dizzy I kept laying down and drinking water, I could not keep anything down my stomach did not feel well. I felt like I had to vomit. When I sat down in the toilet then my ears started ringing pretty bad all of a sudden I could not hear anything and I passed out in the toilet. My husband found me and tried to wake me up. After that I still feel dizzy. I did not have any appetite either. I could barely hold water. The next day I was not as dizzy but my stomach was still upset but I could hold some soup down but then started with diarrhea. Employee health kept calling me everyday and I did the the telehealth appt and I also had a little bit of a rash in my chest that appeared all of a sudden red like a streak. The dizziness I had for the first 4 days, diarrhea did not come until the 3rd day and I had it for 2 days and my temperature was back to normal on the 4th day. Everything started to get better (my stomach stopped feeling queezy) around the 4th day but still felt fatigued until about 12/29/2020.

                                                Anxiety; Headache; Seeing stars; Chest tightness; Hand tremor; SOB; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 40-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1284; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscularly on the left arm on 06Jan2021 (10:15) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included migraines; heart murmur with surgery; grand mal seizure that has resolved; and contrast dye allergy. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan and norethindrone [norethisterone]. The patient previously took phenytoin, iodine, terconazole, tramadol and cetirizine; and had allergies with these medications. On 06Jan2021 (10:15), the patient was seeing stars; had chest tightness; hand tremor; and shortness of breath (SOB). The patient was referred to the Urgent Care Clinic due to these events. On 06Jan2021 (12:30), at the Urgent Clare Clinic, the patient had anxiety and headache. The patient had received acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen and water as treatment for the events, &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was provided with education on managing anxiety. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021 for &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;headache&#39; and &#39;anxiety&#39;. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested post-vaccination.

                                                I received my shot at 12:15 at around 12:30 I started feeling more aware of my throat. My swallowing felt slightly off however, I was not aspirated secretions. My throat felt slightly thick and I had the sensation of wanting to clear my throat. I took a deep breath and I could breath.  It started to feel like my throat was getting sore or irritated. I felt slightly warmer. I decided to wait the full 30 minutes. When I went to stand had a moment of dizziness that passed but then I felt lightheadedness for about 2 hours after the injection. My ear felt like it was warm and there was slight pressure there. My throat continued to feel irritated and still feels lightly irritated after 4 days.  After about 3 hours it felt like something lifted and I felt better. That night I was really fatigued and tired. Maybe slightly cold. The next day felt fine except for the throat irritation that still persists today.  The side where I received the injection my arm, shoulder, and chest area felt affected for two days after receiving injection.

                                                Received  the COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination at 8:40pm at a stadium location.  Around 8:57, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and the left side of my tongue went numb.  A little later the left side of my face felt weird and the inside of my ear felt numb. It wasn&#39;t tingling, but it felt like I had a Novacaine shot (like when you get a filling at the dentist).   My neck got stiff and I was really tired.  The symptoms lasted about 4 hours.    When I woke up this morning the left side of my face and jaw still do not feel 100%.  My left eye is watery.  I&#39;m very tired.

I am being treated with prednisolone drops and a dilating eye drop. My symptoms have improved significantly with the eye drops. I do not know if this is at all related to the vaccine - I have a h/o one other episode of anterior uveitis in my L eye in 2004, felt to be HLA-B27 associated - however I figure it is worth reporting just in case.

The patient was very healthy, in general the consumer knew she had no typical comorbidities. The reason it was thought to be related was she was perfectly healthy prior and right after she got the vaccine, the patient&#39;s tongue started to go numb, that day or the day after (in Jan2021). The events required a visit to Emergency Room, but not to Physician Office. Weight was unknown but the patient was very fit, and BMI (Body mass index) had to be in the normal range. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                December 28,(before the vaccine) I was exposed to COVID at work.  I started feeling feverish on Monday at work. I needed to use my inhaler twice that day. I couldn&#39;t stop coughing at work. At home that night - used inhaler again and I had an elevated temperature - 99. something is high for me. I missed work on Tuesday. Couldn&#39;t breathe and it hurt my chest to breathe. My temp was over 100. Dr appt - went to it late afternoon he wanted me test for COVID. Took vitals - mostly normal - temp.; checked OXYGEN - normal. COVID test - was positive. Temperature went to 101 that night - couldn&#39;t breathe good - couldn&#39;t stop shaking; I was aching and I was in pain; I couldn&#39;t feel warm enough. Tried to sleep and drink fluids. Still didn&#39;t have test results from COVID test on Thursday - temp was up to 102 now. The doctor said they couldn&#39;t do anything until they had results back of test. Friday - 101 and 102.8 - temperature that day. After hours clinic - I called them - Dr - I had to gasp for every breath and I was coughing a lot. He prescribed Benzymidate - cough pearls and Azithromycin  - started taking those that night. By Sunday afternoon, my fever continued and I still didn&#39;t have COVID results yet.  My mom took me to  Urgent Care on Sunday - still running fever; he looked at my lungs and listened -  he could hear wheezing and crackling in my lungs - he determined pneumonia - he didn&#39;t know what kind - he gave me Augmentin - he told me to use both my Albuterol inhaler and steriod haler;  Mucinex expectorant twice a day; Vit C and Vit D and Elderberry and Tylenol and two antibiotics. Saturday - before I went to Urgent Care on Sunday - I noticed I couldn&#39;t smell.  Monday is when I got the positive test for COVID.   Provided info to work and I tried to figure out how to work. Even though I was still very sick, I worked again online on Monday. But I couldn&#39;t keep working - got really whoozy; coughing and gasping  felt like I was going to pass out and felt like I could hardly breathe.  My mom called 911 for me. I managed to get to the bathroom - but having trouble breathing and I almost threw up - heard ringing in my ears and room was spinning. There is a lot of things after that I don&#39;t remember - when they moved me to ambulance to hospital  bed I realized I had an IV in me.  They stabilized me. They let me go home. I took the rest of the week off from work. Took a lot of medication and was keeping up with my vital during that week - 99.8 - 102.8 - for ten days I ran that fever. Broke Jan 20th. I went back to work on Jan 25. Still had to use an inhaler a lot. I&#39;m slowly getting taste back; I can&#39;t taste flavor but can taste salt . I&#39;m slowly getting smell back. I still have a lot of congestion but not as bad. Ears were bothering me this weekend so I did go to urgent care on they put me on a third antibiotic for an ear infection. Gave COVID to my son and my mother. Still have trouble catching me breath. January 23  - my isolation was extended to . the county extended my isolation period because of my family getting COVID. I&#39;m about 75% recovered, I&#39;d say.

A 40-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm), on 31Dec2020 13:30, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic migraines and depression. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medication included erenumab aooe (AIMOVIG), clarithromycin (CLARITIN), ibuprofen (IBU), mirtazapine (REMERON), paracetamol (TYLENOL), ascorbic acid (VIT C), and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient reported that &#34;about 20 min&#34; after receiving the vaccine, the patient&#39;s top back roof of the mouth, uvula and tonsils felt tingly. Then she started having a migraine, with light sensitivity, dry mouth, thirst, racing heart, and felt very hot. For a few seconds she felt dizzy, like how it felt when standing up too quickly, but she was already standing. Simultaneously, she had a sharp pain in her shoulder while she was dizzy. These reactions did not begin to subside until about 4 hours later. All these aforementioned adverse events happened on 31Dec2020 14:00 and the patient recovered from them on an unspecified date with lasting effects (recovered with sequel). After the tingly feeling in her mouth went away, she noticed that her uvula was dropped very low on an unspecified date. It did not look red and it was not sore, but it was so long that it touches her tongue and/or sticks to her tonsils. It has been 3 weeks later and her dropped uvula has not improved or changed. The patient did not recover from the event &#34;uvula was dropped very low/it was so long that it touches her tongue and/or sticks to her tonsils&#34;. She added that she tried to get her 2nd dose on 22Jan2021, but the clinic and the physician did not feel comfortable with giving her the 2nd dose because they have not heard of any cases of side effects of the tingly mouth/uvula/tonsils and continued dropped uvula. No treatment was received for all the adverse events reported. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had the following Covid tests post-vaccination: via nasal swab on 22Jan2021 with result of negative; via nasal swab with Color on 19Jan2021 with result of negative; via nasal swab on 15Jan2021 with result of negative; via nasal swab with Color on 12Jan2021 with result of negative; via nasal swab with Color on 08Jan2021 with result of negative and; via nasal swab with Color on 06Jan2021 with result of negative.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 40-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL8982), intramuscular at left arm on 21Jan2021 15:38 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Tachycardia (started about 4 years ago), Hypertension (started about 4 years ago) and Essential tremor from 2020 (she has been having symptoms for a while; finally, during the summer of 2020, she was diagnosed through a neurologist) and anxiety, all ongoing; pain, back problems and sleep disorder.Concomitant medications included ongoing Tizanidine as muscle relaxant for back problems, ongoing Metoprolol tartrate for hypertension and tachycardia, Primidone for Essential tremor and ongoing Clonazepam for essential tremors, to help her sleep, and also for anxiety. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient got the first COVID vaccine dose. Afterwards, she went to school and it &#34;was downhill from there&#34;. 5 days of persistent symptoms including sweating, muscle pain, joint pain and left hand swelling. It was further reported that she had to wait 15 minutes and then she drove home which is about a 35-minute drive. So about 45 mins after receiving the vaccine, she noticed her tongue, it was more on the right side of her tongue, she can&#39;t explain the sensation. She couldn&#39;t really taste. Things didn&#39;t taste right to her. This lasted 24 hours. She woke up the next day, 22Jan2021, feeling not quite right. She took some Tylenol that morning and went on into school. She took some ibuprofen in the middle of day, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. She has a history of tachycardia, but her pulse kept reading normal. She had a drink she was drinking from lunch and she ended up having the remainder of it the last few hours of that day. At about the end of her workday, around 15:30 she was finishing the Cdrink off and she said to herself &#34;oh that taste like a regular drink again&#34;. This tongue sensation/lack of taste resolved. At that point, she got really excited because she thought this was all that she would experience with the vaccine. She was grateful she had the chance to have the vaccine. She mentions her arm was very sore right off the bat. She experienced immediate soreness in her arm right after receiving the COVID-19. She thought when they were injecting her, it hit her bone. In fact, she joked about this with the person administering the vaccine. The person at the facility told her to rub it, it actually helps with that. This kind of soreness didn&#39;t seem like a major problem. She was still experiencing this soreness. If she is sitting on the couch sideways, with her side of her arm against the couch, she has pain that extends up into her neck. It was pretty painful. Friday, 22Jan2021 (24 hours later after receiving the vaccine), by the time she got home from work, she was really sore. She had some real muscle pain around her hips and upper thighs, both of them. The soreness extended across. It was like she had inflammation that started flaring up. She felt pretty sore that evening. It wasn&#39;t like a normal muscle soreness. She went to bed because she was pretty tired. The next morning (Saturday, 23 Jan 2021), she couldn&#39;t get off the couch. She had such bad muscle and joint pain. She slept off and on, the pain was pretty bad. Her whole body had so much stiffness and inflammation. Every muscle and every joint just hurt. She confirmed that she hasn&#39;t been able to regulate her body temperature. This has been going on since Saturday evening (23Jan2021). She stated that this wasn&#39;t normal for her. She does take medications to lower heart rate but she hadn&#39;t taken it. She was talking to her best friend about how she had been sore and slept all evening. She checked her pulse and it had dropped down to 40. Her O2 level was at 92. She didn&#39;t think it was that big of a deal. Her best friend was kind of freaking out about it. She had such pain and stiffness in her chest that extended across her shoulders, it made it difficult to breathe. She was laboring to breathe. She checked her pulse thinking maybe she was feeling anxious about it and her HR was up, but it wasn&#39;t. She states happened so bad yesterday, yesterday was worse than before. She got up on Sunday morning, 24Jan2021, and took a hot shower. When the water from the shower head hit her chest, clarified as her upper chest muscles just below her collar bone, the pressure of the water hitting her was painful. However, she was able to get up, she was moving around. Still the whole time. she had this fever-ish feeling. Her kids were telling her that they were sweating because she had the house at 76 degrees. Monday morning, 25Jan2021, she woke up and she was itchy around her left forearm. She was really itching on Friday night, but she didn&#39;t think anything about it. When she took a hot shower yesterday (25Jan2021), a red rash came up on her chest and it looked like she had hives on her forearm. She didn&#39;t know if the hot water flared that up, but she doesn&#39;t have any allergies. She also had gastrointestinal issues. She has had some nausea that has lasted the entire time since she received the vaccine. She clarifies the nausea has came and gone. She hasn&#39;t had much of an appetite. They thought she had a fever yesterday at school. It was 99. something but she had already taken Tylenol a couple hours before and she was sweating so much. She states she has also had diarrhea the last few days, clarified as the last 2 days (24Jan2021). She has already spoken to someone to report her symptoms but wasn&#39;t sure about and had question about getting the second vaccine dose. She reported having gone to Urgent care where she was told she had Post covid vaccine syndrome and that she shouldn&#39;t have a problem with the second dose. She explained she went to the urgent care yesterday, 25Jan2021. She called her doctor that morning and was told to continue to treat her symptoms and take ibuprofen and Tylenol but if she got worse, to go to urgent care. So, she went to the urgent care (Product information for the Tylenol and Ibuprofen she has been taking (Ibuprofen: UPC/NDC: not provided when probed. Lot: P142385 Expiry date: Apr2023 and Tylenol: UPC/NDC: not provided when probed. Lot: P121664 Expiry date: Sep2023). The nurse just explained (Name Withheld) was having the same exact symptoms as the patient, except it was (Name Withheld) second dose. Her symptoms were identical to the patient. The patient wasn&#39;t initially sure if it was from the vaccine or if it was her anxiety. The patient didn&#39;t feel anxious and her heart rate wasn&#39;t up. The patient told she didn&#39;t think anxiety caused her to feel like she had a fever. The school nurse looked it up and found out more symptoms kind of wax and wane. Her symptoms got much worse. On 25Jan2021, Test: Rapid COVID-19 test Result: Negative. The event immediate soreness in arm was not recovered; event couldn&#39;t really taste, things didn&#39;t really taste right to her recovered on 22Jan2021 and nausea recovered in Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021101606 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                After getting the shot, I walked over to the observation area a few yards away. I sat down and my vision went blurry and the room lights were too bright. I spoke with a dr about taking ibuprofen for my ankle, as I was told to only take Tylenol. The dr said that I was fine to take it. I didn?t want to ask about my vision because I was embarrassed and didn?t want to be stressing or panicking and that be the cause of my vision issues. But it didn?t subside so I checked with a nurse before leaving, about 15 mins after the vaccination  and asked if I was ok and she said yes, that she only had 1 other person tell her about blurred vision. I walked to my car and the sun was so bright I had to shield my eyes. I got in the car and took my mask off. I looked in the mirror and my cheeks and chin were flushed but my skin was pale. My husband sat with me for 10 mins and then went in for his shot. At this point it had been a little over 30 mins since getting vaccinated. I FaceTimed my mom so I wouldn?t be alone. As we were talking she said my face was getting puffy and I was getting darker circles under my eyes. I got off of the phone with my mom and called my husband on FaceTime. I asked him to talk to the dr for me and let her see my face. She said my face was swollen and red and asked if I could breathe or felt like my throat was closing over or tongue was swollen. I told her no. Once again I was told I was ok and to take Benadryl. An hr or so after the 1st dose vaccination I was able to get Benadryl and Tylenol. In a 12hr period I took 2 doses of Benadryl and 2 doses of Tylenol. My face got better in 12-24hr but I still have blurred vision and light sensitivity.

A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER), first dose at the age of 40-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Mar2021 13:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and known allergies: sulfa from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included rizatriptan; vitamin b complex (VITAMIN B); vitamin c [ascorbic acid]; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported within 10 minutes lips felt numb, swollen. Numbness spread throughout face, checked in with the medic and had vitals checked. Blood pressure was high, and pulse was high. Numbness spread throughout whole face. Ambulance was called and she was transported to the hospital. Within the hour of getting the shot she became unbalanced. She was gasping for air at times and started to feel numb in both arms. Upon arrival to the emergency room her legs started to feel numb. By nightfall she was unable to straighten out my legs. She couldn&#39;t stand up or lift her legs no matter how hard she tried. She was admitted to the hospital. A brain MRI was done and came back normal. Another one may be done. Bloodwork revealed ferritin levels were low and she was getting treatment for that (ferrous sulfate). While sleeping at night she woke up a few times gasping for air feeling like her throat was closing up. Today, she was able to stand up, but unable to stand up straight. She met with physical therapy and is using a walker. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days from 09Mar2021 to 12Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high on 09Mar2021, heart rate: high on 09Mar2021, magnetic resonance imaging brain: normal on 09Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: unknown results on 09Mar2021, serum ferritin: ferritin levels were low on 09Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The patient did not recover from the events.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140/ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration, at the left arm on 30Dec2020 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital.  Medical history included seasonal allergies and doesn&#39;t take medications. On the same day of 30Dec2020, about an hour after vaccination, patient got a very metallic taste in mouth, which lasted for about 12-18 hours and did sleep a lot, which she expected, but woke up about 11 at night and still had it and it was gone. Patient knew she slept longer than she normally does, went to bed at 1PM and slept until 11PM, which is not usually normal. Was up for about an hour or two and then went back to bed until 8AM of 31Dec2020. Patient was concern was if it was some type of reaction that it would mean she was going to have a stronger reaction to the second one and stated it was irritating but not a huge deal. Patient also felt tired and expected it as she worked five 12-hour shifts in a row. Patient was not sure if the metallic taste was connected to the COVID-19 vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa antibiotics. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took meperidine (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies. Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sharp intermittent pain in her left jugular/carotid neck area and felt a little &#34;tipsy&#34;. This continued for about one day. Then last week (approximately 28Dec2020), her upper left molar started aching (toothache). This subsided within about 2 days. Then on 30Dec2020, she developed a severe earache, which began to subside within about 2 days. Around 31Dec2020 through 04Jan2021, she had intermittent numbness and tingling in her left jaw area. Last night (05Jan2021), she developed a sharp pain on the back side of her left neck area. She went to the doctor on 04Jan2021, and no treatment was prescribed. She began self-medicating with an old prescription of prednisone on the evening of 04Jan2020 due to being fearful of developing Bell&#39;s Palsy. Most of her symptoms have now improved after beginning the prednisone. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Since the injection I had been getting headaches almost daily, mostly on my right side of my head.  On Dec. 5, 2021 I noticed I was getting a sore eyebrow.  Later that evening ok noticed swollen lymph nodes throughout my scalp, face, ear, jaw, neck and chest.  My eyebrow also started to swell and was slightly pink.  When the swelling was worse the next day - I went to urgent care and saw A doctor that diagnosed me with facial cellulitis.  After a couple days my eye was not getting any better and started to itch severely.  Called to urgent care over the weekend and takes to one of the providers who said to use cold compresses and elevate my head as much as I could.  On Dec. 11, 2021 I called back to the provider I had seen on Dec. 6 - he told me he believed I had developed shingles and to go to the eye doctor that day.  I saw a doctor on Dec. 11 &amp; was diagnosed with shingles.  They started me on antivirals along with the antibiotics they had prescribed on Dec. 6.

                                                Pt came to the COVID vaccination clinic today to receive her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine: EL3246. Pt states &#34;I am very nervous about getting this&#34;.  Pt brought a co-worker with her for support. Pt has &#34;MS and Anxiety&#34;. Pt received her vaccine without any difficulty. While sitting for her observation time after the vaccine she began having some &#34;tingling of her tongue and face feels hot&#34;.  Pt denies any breathing difficulty. Pt states &#34;I am not sure if this is from my anxiety or a reaction&#34;.  Pt is drinking water with honey. Gave her some fresh water and monitored.  Checked on her a couple minutes later. She was in the chair and then up to walk and was concerned &#34;my legs are feeling tingly and a little cold&#34;.  When asked if she ever takes BENADRYL for her previous medication reactions Pt states &#34;yes&#34;.  I asked her if she has someone who can drive her home and she made arrangements for her co-worker to take her. Gave Pt BENADRYL 25 mg po one for potential reaction symptoms at 15:05. Moved Pt to a quieter place to monitor and observe. Gave her a warm blanket and some juice. Vitals at 15:18:  BP= 116/68, HR=80 Resp rate 16-18.   Pt is alert, oriented and states &#34;feeling a little better&#34;.  Tingling sensation is &#34;leaving&#34;.  Pt denies any respiratory symptoms. Monitored by RN. Pt set up with telephone call with Employee Health Provider, PAC.  Determined this is most likely symptoms caused by her anxiety.  Pt left ambulatory with her co-worker and symptoms were resolved.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting my vaccine I noticed the roof of my mouth itching as well as my tongue and back of my throat.  I waited to see if it would go away and then a couple minutes later noticed my lips started itching and swelling and from there it just got worse.  I told the nurse practitioner that I think I was having a reaction, she had me take a seat told her my entire mouth throat &amp; lips felt swollen and itching and she looked and said it was full blown anaphylaxis reaction.  Administered EpiPen, benadryl and called ambulance where they took me to medial emergency department.

Paramedics came to evaluate and performed numerous 12-lead EKG&#39;s and noted multiple Premature Ventricular Contractions and transported me to the hospital where I was observed and consulted on from ED Physician. Later was evaluated by electrophysiology cardiologist with echocardiogram and EKG. Multiple physicians have advised not to get second vaccine.

                                                Within 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my left arm became very heavy and there was a tingling/neuro sensation in left wrist/hand. A pressure began in the  anterior of my throat which increased gradually. I sought treatment in our Urgent Care just after noon that same day. The Provider monitored my vitals which were good and administered liquid Pepcid. Said Provider chose not to give Benadryl as I had taken Zyrec that morning for my allergies. I was discharged from the Urgent Care and went back to work at 1245. At 1730 hours, I had a slight headache above my right eye and extreme right-sided jaw pain with tooth sensitivity. These lasted for only 10 minutes. At 1830, the anterior and bilateral portions of my throat began to feel &#34;prickly&#34; and I developed a wheeze. I used an albuterol inhaler to relieve the wheeze successfully. At this time I also developed an itchiness throughout my whole body, worse on left side than right side. I took 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. At 0300, I took another dose of 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. I also took an itch pill/antihistamine of my husband&#39;s which provided no relief. At 0800, I took 20 mg of Zyrtec. At 1030, I took 100mg of Benadryl. I continued to use Benadryl throughout the day, every 4-5 hours.  At 1800, I had a fullness in my throat, a tightness in my chest and my left shoulder blade felt almost numb.  I also had a hoarse voice which passed by the next morning. The chest tightness was intermittent over the next day or two.  On Friday, the itchiness had improved some but was still prominent. I continued to use Zyrtec and Benadryl throughout the day. My Primary Doctor called in Prednisone if needed. By Saturday morning, I felt MUCH better. Today is Sunday and I am no longer itching and I feel so much better today.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 06Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history included anaemia and anaphylactic reaction to shellfish. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and had no other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021, within 2 hours (at 12:00 PM), the patient experienced blurred vision, within 4 hours tachycardia and dizziness, within 8 hours headache, chills, body aches, and extreme fatigue, and within 12 hours, tightness in her chest, SOB, extreme fatigue, and body aches. As treatment, the patient received ibuprofen. The patient stated that she had a pretty severe reaction. She also informed her employer but nobody helped. They observed her 15 mins. post-vaccination. She was fine within 15 minutes. It was also reported that within 2 hours, she had blurry vision, tachycardia, and felt dizzy. In the middle of the day, she felt chills, shivers, dizziness, bloating, and headache. The patient also stated that she experienced shakes and taking a shower hurt, also, chest was tight all day. It was further reported that when she was sent back home from work, she started having a severe body ache, fatigue, chills, and shivers. She experienced tightness in her chest , shortness of breath, and she could barely get out of bed. This lasted all day. She still had the blurred vision and couldn&#39;t focus on her cell phone. She felt a little bit better today but was still not 100%. She contacted her MD who advised her to report this to Pfizer. The patient wanted to know if it was safe to receive the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that the events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Outcome of the event &#39;Vision blurred&#39; was not recovered, for the event &#39;Tremor&#39; was unknown, while for the rest of the events was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

Heart and lungs sounds were normal. Vitals at 1:49 pm: HR: 102, BP: 144/70, O2: 95%, RR: 21. At this point, on the basis of the symptoms she was experiencing, RN&#39;s decided to administer Benadryl 50 mg IM that was in the emergency kit. When the decision was made, client was asked if it was okay to administer Benadryl IM. She was explained the purpose of Benadryl, the side effects, and risks and benefits. Client consented to receiving Benadryl IM. Benadryl 50 mg IM administered to RA by RN at 13:51. By 13:53, her tongue was not swollen anymore. At 13:58, she was not SOB anymore, talking in full sentences, no acute distress, tingling stopped.

Following this immunization, she appropriately stayed in the waiting area for the 30 minutes. She then got in car and 15 minutes after, she noticed that her tongue was feeling full/swollen and that was experiencing neck swelling. These symptoms persisted and resembled a prior allergic response to Tetracycline and Aleve. Wheezing and breathing difficulty ensued and EMS was activated.   On arrival to the emergency department she was found to have wheezing with stridor.  A dose of epinephrine was administered and she was monitored in the emergency department with an initial improvement in symptoms. Approximately one hour and 30 minutes after initial epinephrine administration patient reported that she was having continued difficulty swallowing and she was starting to feel a little worse.  At this point a second dose of IM epinephrine was administered.    The patient was subsequently  admitted to inpatient medicine team for further monitoring.

                                                Pfizer shot #1: She received the 1st COVID vaccine Pfizer on January 24th at 7:00 p.m..  The following day she noted a low-grade fever.  On January 26 she noted edema of her eyes and lips associated with facial redness and itching that she treated with Benadryl intermittently for the past 2.5 weeks.  She was seen in follow-up by her dermatologist who suspected an inflammatory reaction and prescribed anti-itch facial cream.  She was also seen by her primary care who suspected angioedema and prescribed her an EpiPen which she has not needed to use.   Pfizer shot #2: 2nd shot delayed due to snow. Above sx resolved before shot #2. She had her 2nd COVID injection February 20 at 3:50 p.m. About 1.5-2 hours later she noted onset of itching to her eyes and nipples along with itching of the skin in the locations of her usual eczema.  She noted that her lips and eyes were a little puffy but less severe swelling to the eyes and lips than the 1st injection.  She took 2 Benadryl shortly after onset of these symptoms.  This seemed to lessen symptoms about 50%. Later she noticed that her voice sounded raspy and hoarse and she had a sensation of swelling to her tongue and throat but she was able to swallow.  Her throat felt scratchy.  She denies having lightheadedness, urticaria or GI symptoms. She went to the ED and was treated with benadryl, solumedrol and pepcid, monitored for a few hours and then discharged on 60 mg prednisone X 3 days and advised to continue benadryl 50 mg Q6h. She takes zyrtec 10 mg BID for seasonal/perennial allergies.   Allergy history: She has a history of both idiopathic urticaria in early childhood and idiopathic angioedema in her early 20&#39;s. States she had extensive testing but the cause was never exposed. Took high dose prednisone for 4-5 months, angioedema resolved spontaneously and then flared again a few months later. Finally resolved with n additional 3 months of prednisone. She has both seasonal (feb-may) and perennial allergies to cat and dust, asthma and allergy to ampicillin--rash in childhood, and humira--fevers.

The night of 2/25 (almost 6 days later) experienced flu like symptoms - chills, shaking due to cold, fever, thirst, joint and body aches, light headedness, fatigue. Morning of 2/26 chills and fever had subsided, had 8/10 severity headache that gradually decreased throughout the day. Body aches gradually subsided throughout the day and all symptoms were resolved by 6pm on 2/26. I had very similar symptoms after my first dose as well - initial injection 1/29 at 12:30pm, flu like symptoms began early morning of 2/1 that lasted about 15 hours.

                                                After 10 minutes, patient reported metal taste in mouth and feeling faint. She also felt tingling in her arms and lips. She struggled to get up. Her breathing seemed fine but neck was red. She laid on floor with legs elevated until her dizziness subsided. She originally said she felt better but then dizziness returned. Called 911 and had Epi-pen ready. She was breathing fine when paramedics arrived. Her husband later called at 7:45pm and reported she was feeling fine. He said the emergency room gave her a steroid, anti-histamine, and pepcid. She is not going to receive the second covid shot. Her husband later stated she got a full body rash when she had covid. I also advised them to register on the v-safe site.

                                                With having MS, I have severe anxiety and I was anxious  before going in- numbness and tingling in my legs and tingling on my tongue. Took Benadryl - tongue tingling went away and the legs tingling and numbness was the same  and started getting worse - they monitored my vitals and everything looked good and numbness remained. I had a driver and they allowed me to leave due to the Benadryl  _ just took that one dose of Benadryl (didn&#39;t take anymore after that) and then the numbness in my legs remained for about two and a half weeks. I used a cane for two days. I had a fever and chills that first night, body aches and injection site pain and severe fatigue and those symptoms lasted one day except fatigue was for three days. The day after the shot was the worse of the symptoms. They followed up with me that evening and they followed up with me at work.  I had the next dose - February 4, 2021 and experienced everything except the numbness in the tongue. Informal doctor visit because I work there.

It started on the right side of throat, then the left a few minutes later. Eventually a feeling of pressure behind eardrums and a little trouble swallowing. Epi was given approximately 20 minutes after vaccine was administered, then a dose of Benadryl. Paramedics were called, transported to ED for observation for 4 hours. Symptom of tightness in throat improved within minutes of Epi, returned after a few hours with less severity. That feeling took a few days to completely subside.

A 41-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 08Jan2021 at 08:00 AM  (at the age of 41-years-old) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the first dose vaccine BNT162B2 (LOT: EK5730 and EXP: Mar2021) on 18Dec2020.  The subject had a history of ongoing Migraine. Relevant concomitant medications were unknown. The patient stated that after her second dose on 08Jan2021, the reaction started at 06:00PM that night. She says she had a rash and injection site pain that went her arm to her shoulder and neck. She says she had a runny nose, runny eyes, cough with taste of blood, shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, chills, and dizziness that night. She says she did not do any treatment that night, she thought the fever would run its course. Caller says that the next day she had severe fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, runny nose and eyes, and she also started to fall down stairs and had muscle weakness. She says she had blurred and double vision, and ringing in her ears. She says she progressed from that in a week to having urinary incontinence, intermittent frequency at night, flank pain, and an inability to control her temperature. She says she was having hot or cold sweats and chills which continued quite a while.  She also reported that she has gained back muscle control, though she still has days where she is extremely weak, and her dizziness comes and goes. She says that the ear ringing has stayed the same, and her shortness of breath has stayed the same. She says that as of Mar 2nd she has been diagnosed with severe asthma, and she has never had any type of asthma or breathing problems before.  The reporter stated that that this was disabling, she hasn&#39;t been able to work since 08Jan2021.   The reported events were inability to work  (impaired work ability) on 08Jan2021, rash on 08Jan2021, injection site pain  (vaccination site pain) on 08Jan2021, runny nose  (rhinorrhea) on 08Jan2021, runny eyes  (eye discharge) on 08Jan2021, cough with taste of blood  (haemoptysis) on 08Jan2021, shortness of breath  (dyspnea) on 08Jan2021, fatigue on 08Jan2021, pyrexia on 08Jan2021, chills on 08Jan2021, dizziness on 08Jan2021, falling down stairs (fall) on 09Jan2021, muscular weakness on 09Jan2021, vision blurred on 09Jan2021, double vision  (diplopia) on 09Jan2021, ringing in ears  (tinnitus), urinary incontinence, urinary frequency (pollakiuria), flank pain, inability to control temperature  (body temperature abnormal), sweating (hyperhidrosis), wheezing on 09Jan2021 and feeling of body temperature change. Clinical outcome of the event inability to work was not recovered, while clinical outcome of all other events was unknown. Laboratory data included pulmonary function test, result: 40%.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Inability to work is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Two weeks after getting the second dose of the vaccine, I had two episodes of vertigo.  I have no history of vertigo.  I also developed  bouncy vision where it looks like things are bouncing up and down or moving side to side when I walk or turn my head.  It has not resolved.  I am scheduled with a neurologist on 5/4/21 to determine if I have any vestibular damage.  It is possible this is permanent and at this current time it is very disabling. I am not sure if this is related to the vaccine but I thought it best to report it in case other reports of this come up.

Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

                                                While patient was receiving her second dose of the Pfizer brand Covid-19 vaccination (at 14:50), she mentioned to me that she had a sustained local reaction to her first dose.  Her arm had a hard, red, hot spot for approximately a week.  At this time I told her we would like her to stay under observation for 30  Min instead of the normal 15 min. At approximately 25 min post vaccination, the pt reported the following: &#34;arm felt heavy, both arms did, but more so the affected arm, instant headache, sore neck, vision went fuzzy, breathing wasn&#39;t difficult but felt labored, throat felt like it was closing/congested, rash on the inside of the affected arm&#34;.    Pt stated that her heart felt like it was &#34;pounding&#34;.    VS:  162/96, 99% RA, HR in the 70&#39;s.    Patient was administered 50ml IM diphenhydramine and monitored for 90 minutes in the clinic area.  Dr. was consulted and also spoke with the pt, advising her to continue with OTC diphenhydramine once at home.     The symptoms resolved after approximately 40 minutes.  By 17:00 the patient was deemed stable to go home with the instructions to go immediately to ED should any further Sx present.  It was verified that she did not live alone and would have someone with her that could assist.    Pt was subsequently followed up with a phone call on the next day by RN who relayed that she was very tired, but no other complications.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

                                                About 20 min after receiving my Covid 19 vaccine, I left Hospital and began to feel numb in my throat, my lower face, and the tops of my shoulders. I had reduced sensation, but also felt as though I had no muscle control with movement. Examples of this are when I tried to flex my head forward as if in a nodding motion, or to elevate my shoulders like a shrug, or clench my jaw like when chewing. These were all extremely difficult and I felt as though I had no awareness of if I was even moving these parts of my body whatsoever when I tried to voluntarily do so. It was very strange and also upsetting. I also began to have blurred vision; it was difficult to focus or see properly, such as when you visit the eye doctor and they dilate your pupils and everything seems blurry and out of focus for a period of time afterwards. This all lasted for about exactly 1 hour post.  I did not seek medical attention for this as it did not worsen. I never had any difficulty breathing. It then completely went away.

                                                Migraine on day 3. Started around 5 pm the first time, took ibuprofen and hydroxyzine to sleep until it passed. Day 6, another migraine. Ibuprofen and caffeine. Day 7 I went to get a haircut thinking the migraines may be caused by heavy long hair. Day 8 extremely painful migraine, can?t open eyes as light made it worse, nausea, vomiting. Called my PCP, they recommended going to urgent care after I vomited. I couldn?t get a ride so I took ibuprofen, Tylenol, and hydroxyzine to help me sleep until it?s gone.

                                                I am going to describe all my symptoms so far in detail.  Shortly after the shot in the medical observation area I experienced mild nausea that went away for the rest of the day.  About an hour after the injection, I experienced nasal drainage in the back of my throat that lasted about 30 minutes.  3 hours after my shot, the arm pain at injection site began, followed by 6 hours later moderate to extreme fatigue that did not cause me to be sleepy or drowsy--simply fatigued.  I had enhanced sense of taste and smell.  On Wednesday, 1/27 I woke up seeming okay and tried to work at my computer from home.  I experienced light-headed and dizziness, and a headache that feels like pressure, and sinus pressure at the bridge of my nose.  I had to disengage from work.  After lunch around 2 PM I had extreme fatigue and had to lie down in bed the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I have moderate nausea that comes in goes in waves.  This morning, Wednesday, 1/28 I woke up with nausea and ate breakfast with a heightened sense of smell and taste.  I logged into work and the lightheadedness and dizziness began again (also sort of in waves, though the headache is more pervasive and less wave-like than the nausea), along with waves of moderate nausea and headache.  The arm pain at the sight of injection has significantly abated from a punch to mild pain.  The &#34;sinus&#34; or sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose seems only a fraction improved.  The headache or pressure has moved from the back of my head to the right side of my head.  I had no body aches, but this morning has mild to moderate body aches this morning in my legs and hip bones.   1/29 I woke up with 20%-30% reduced symptoms of nausea and headache, but the dizziness and sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose remain the same.  I still have enhanced taste and smell (a sensory plus it&#39;s not a distorted or odd enhancement, simply the same flavors and tastes enhanced).  The ache that began yesterday in my lower body, my legs still ache, though it feels more like numbness than an ache.  I tried doing some stretches which felt good, but my legs still feel the same after stretching.  Pain at the site of injection is reduced 90%. There are some strawberries sitting next to me, and I can smell them acutely. Yesterday, 1/30, I woke up with mild nausea and fatigue.  This nausea dissipated in the morning, but I felt too fatigued to do Pilates.  The waves of dizziness and waves of nausea returned mid-day and I had a low-grade fever of 99.4 (my temp. Tends to run slightly lower than 98.6, as I take it regularly).  The pain/pressure in the bridge of my nose has reduced 30%, but still remains.  The ache or numbness in my thighs remains the same. This morning, 1/31, my temp is normal at 98.6, but I have mild waves of nausea and moderate waves of dizziness.  The pain/pressure on my nose remains the same as yesterday.  I have some mild ear pressure.  My thigh weakness remains the same.  I am too fatigued to attempt Pilates.  Acute sense of smell and taste remains the same.  The headaches or pressure also seem improved since Saturday 1/30. Monday, 02/01 - ah back to work I woke up with moderate nausea and pretty intense body fatigue and muscle aches in my lower body.  I had to work, and I just wanted to crawl back into bed.  I worked anyway, also the fatigue tends to worsen mid-day.  The dizziness is moderate in waves, and the headache is still mild, along with that mild sinus pressure on my nose.  I was in bed after dinner but could have rested all day.  02/02 I awoke with a very mild nausea! The intense fatigue (which worsened several days past my vaccine) was mild. I was ready to attempt my regular Pilates routine, and I did it!  My muscle aches are mild to moderate (also, why are my muscle aches mostly confined to my thighs and hips I do have vague pain at the injection site, but its vague, and I use my whole body in Pilates) dizziness waves are back as I sit here typing and get ready to login online to my job staring at the computer screen is jarring to the dizziness waves and reminds me of the mild headache.  This is the best I&#39;ve felt since 1/27 through mid-day I tend to worsen and dizziness that is moderate is disturbing.  The heightened sense of taste and smell also seems to have waned a bit in the past two days, back to what I was per usual? I tend to have an acute sense of smell and taste.  *I would like it noted in light of new evidence that many people that have had COVID are experiencing intense reactions to the first dose that it is quite likely that I had COVID back in March when my learning center (I work with students age 4-adult, some of which are learning disabled and have autism) emergency closed because a client called to say she was positive for COVID.  I had taken her sons temperature the day before.  Me, and my two co-workers on my management team were also feeling sick.  I had a sore throat and chest pains for approx. a month, but at the time COVID testing was not widely available.  Since then, My co-worker has tested positive twice for the antibodies, and her husband, who was also sick at the same time, has tested negative twice.  I tested negative once for the antibodies, though given my job, my commute on the subway during rush hour my co-workers positivity, and my intense reaction to the first dose I most likely had COVID.  My boyfriend&#39;s roommate recently also revealed that he is positive to the antibodies, and he was literally sneezing and coughing in the same room with us this past summer and spring.    I think a 2nd dose of the same vaccine will cause fainting and vomiting, and the need for two weeks off of my work. This dizziness is alarming.  I&#39;m also thinking not having antibodies means nothing in terms of my body and immune system recognizing the vaccine and the virus, making me more ill than when and if I actually had COVID in March or last year.

                                                Patient reports that she received dose one of the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine last Friday, February 5, 2021 at 2:03 PM.  She received this here at facility campus vaccine clinic.  She felt a strange tingling sensation immediately upon receiving the injection that extended from the injection site across her upper back but otherwise tolerated the injection well.  Because of her history of food allergy she was advised to remain at the vaccination clinic for 30 minutes.  During that 30-minute wait period she felt generally well however began to develop pruritus at her back in the legs.  She did not mention this to the staff at the vaccine clinic and did not look at her skin.  The pruritus was not too bothersome and she left the vaccine area after 30 minutes and walked down to our clinic to return to work.  Her pruritus intensified very quickly upon returning to her desk and within a few minutes of after her return she went into the bathroom to look at her back and had patches of red, raised, urticarial lesions across her back.  She began to feel itchy all over her body.  She remained at work and did not take any medication or seek any medical help.  She did not look at her legs.  The pruritus intensified and when she looked at her skin of her legs approximately 1 or 2 hours later she had developed urticaria essentially head to toe.  She had large confluent patches of urticaria at bilateral thighs, urticaria at her face, trunk, arms, legs.   At this point she felt otherwise well.  She went home and took 10 mg of Claritin and applied a topical Benadryl cream to her skin.  This was not helpful.  She had severe pruritus of her eyes and eyelids.  She took 50 mg of oral Benadryl which also was not particularly helpful.  Sometime in the middle of the night that night she developed chills, felt feverish, and developed intense muscle and joint aches.  She took an unknown dose of ibuprofen with minimal improvement in muscle and joint pain.  She did have improvement in fever.  Following day was Saturday, she spent the whole day in bed in extreme pain.  She describes the pain at her wrists as feeling as though &#34;somebody was breaking my bones&#34; with any movement of her wrists.  She had pain even laying flat in her bed and had severe pain at all of her joints with movement.  She tried taking a flexeril with no improvement. She recalls a T-max of 102 sometime on Saturday or Sunday.  At that time she had been taking ibuprofen around-the-clock.  She also took 10 mg of Claritin approximately every 4 hours.  Each night she also took 50 mg of Benadryl.  She continued to experience urticarial skin rash and intense pruritus of the skin.  The urticaria waxed and waned during this time.  She also developed a fever blister at her lower lip. She spent most of Sunday in bed also.  She was feeling a bit better by Monday however still had intense pruritus.  Skin rash was much improved at most of her body however she still had mild urticaria at her face.  She did not have a fever on Monday but was continuing to take ibuprofen around-the-clock.  She discontinued ibuprofen yesterday and has not had fevers or chills since Sunday.  At this point her urticaria has essentially resolved. She continues taking claritin 10mg BID to 3 times a day and also 50mg bendaryl at bedtime.    She did not experience any bruising related to this rash however did have excoriation from scratching particularly at her face.   Throughout the course of these days she did not have any episodes of angioedema of the lips, tongue.  She denies difficulty breathing, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, throat tightening, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope.   She has a history of oral allergy syndrome with peanut.  Promethazine has caused diplopia, weakness.  Simvastatin caused muscle weakness.  She has never had any issues with vaccines.  She has been getting a flu shot yearly with no difficulty.  Her most recent vaccine was October 8, 2020, quadrivalent influenza vaccine.   No known history of allergy to polyethylene glycol.   No history of chronic urticaria.  She takes NSAIDs frequently without any difficulty.  She has not taken any NSAIDs prior to receiving this injection or developing this urticaria.  She had however taken 10 mg of Claritin prior to receiving this injection.   She has no history of anaphylaxis.  She has undergone surgery under general anesthesia on more than one occasion without issue.  No history of reaction to stinging insect venom.  She receives immunotherapy for inhaled environmental allergens here in our office and has done well with this.   She denies any recent medication changes or new over-the-counter medications.   She has not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19.

I sought treatment at Urgent Care. They prescribed 4 mg pack of 5 day steroid. On Saturday morning, the hives returned worse and covered my entire body except my face. The injection arm was swollen and red. I also begin to have shortness of breath. I went to the ER and they gave me an IV of benedryl and prednisone. I was released with another 4 day course but with 20 mg of steroid .

Realized the liquid was under clear part of eye.  Looked like some bubbled coming from top of eye, so weird.  Could feel the liquid moving in eye when moving head.  Touched the eye, liquid spread around iris and pupil not going over it.  Was so weird.  No pain.  Felt that it had to be a reaction to the shot.   My body seems to be pretty sensitive.  I have had cold sore a few times back to back due to stress.  My youngest has Cystic Fibrosis that is what allowed us to get the vaccine, in home caregiver of medically fragile child.  Went to urgent care, just needed a professional to say it would go away in a few days and note the reaction.  The PA said it was not a reaction to the vaccine, that it is not listed as a reaction in the data.  Blah blah blah.  I disagreed and left it at that.  Had a benedylt last night and put  a pataday drop in eye as recommended by PA

                                                Ten days after the vaccine was administered I woke up feeling like something was wrong. I just didn?t feel right. I tried to lay down to see if I could feel better but this did not help. Even while in a relaxed state my blood pressure was up to 170/97 and heart rate of 220. I was very dizzy and felt like fainting but did not lose consciousness. I had a terrible pressure in my chest, in the left side of my neck and along the inside of my left arm. Also notable my vision was blurred.  Called 911 ambulance took me to the Hospital ER and the ekg they performed was abnormal and also notable when they drew my blood my sodium level was below the normal threshold. I had taken 3 nitroglycerin tablets and my symptoms subsided enough for them to let me go home. Since coming home my bp has remained elevated much higher than normal at around 135/85. I continue to feel not quite normal and have the pressure in my left side of neck, chest and left arm. I feel very certain this is all due to the covid vaccine I received.

I saw the cardiologist who believed it to be sinus tackycardia as a result as an AE to  vaccine.  Felt as if my face and lips were swelling  so I took benedry and laid down again and the next morning  when I woke up and my face and lips were super swollen.  But by the 3rd day the symptoms began to subside a little.  By the 24th my HR had balanced out and I only had residual swelling around the eye area.

When I woke up I had numbness and weakness in the right of my tongue which I quickly realized included the right portion of my face. Included tongue was numb and I couldn&#39;t move it. An Er trip and CT scan confirmed it was Bells Palsy. Today,  My symptoms continue. Top of my head all the way to the  way to bottom of neck is experiencing paralysis.  Can move tongue now and it&#39;s partly numb but it&#39;s cooperating a bit more now. Nerve pain has worsened all over all the right side of face. Feels like someone  has kicked  face and I have a deep bruise.  It&#39;s a deep ache. Nothing will take away the ache away. My eye doesn&#39;t lubricate like it should. So I have to either manually close it and wet it manually or tape it closed.

                                                I almost blacked out around 8:30 AM the morning after my vaccination. I took my dogs outside and started feeling woozy and seeing spots. By the time I got back into my house, I had tunnel vision and could not see directly in front of me. I went to lay down, but ran into a piece of furniture because I was so disoriented and hit my shin on it. I collapsed on my bed. I stayed there for  few hours and then I was ok. I had severe, flu-like symptoms for most of the day - fever, chills, low energy, joint pain (specifically back and hip) - that waxed and waned. I finally felt almost back to normal approximately 50 hours after the injection.

She had her husband come to drive her home due to receiving a dose of Benadryl and due to the potential for drowsiness with this medication.   She was instructed to take another dose of Benadryl in 6-8 hours if her symptoms continue to persist.  She states that her husband will be home with her for the remainder of the day and will observe her and seek medical attention if needed.  She was also instructed to follow up with her primary care provider if symptoms persist beyond the next few hours today and certainly if they persist following a second dose of Benadryl in 6-8 hours.  She expressed understanding.  She stated that she was comfortable going home and continuing to monitor her symptoms.

                                                Within 30 minutes of shot-Fleeting itching in both ears, fingertips, and soles of feet.  Blurred peripheral vision in left eye only.  Dizziness, wooziness.  All resolved with 35 minutes of injection, initially. Within 4 hours of shot-Exponential increase in pain from waist down, including lower back pain.  Took Motrin 600 mgs which resolved pain within 1 hour of taking it.  Felt off/not myself-Felt foggy-headed-pressure in head and ears was not normal.  2100-0000 (Evening of shot)-Moderate sporadic dizziness that became moderate constant dizziness-Took 1 25 mg chewable Meclizine with 1 cup of water.  Pain increased and Motrin wore off.  Fatigue grew worse.  1/13/21-1/14/21-SEVERE back pain.  Intense pain in legs and hips.  Upper respiratory symptoms-Nasal congestion, ear pressure, sinus pain/pressure, chest and upper back discomfort, chest congestion, irritation, and aching.  Cheeks and nose looked puffy/swollen.  Eye pain, headache on and off.  Fatigue, dragging.  Felt feverish but no actual fever.  Body aches-sides, legs-front, back, and sides, lower back, and glutes.  Felt like arthritis from waist down, including lower back.  Took nighttime cold syrup, etc. to be able to sleep and/or at least dull the pain.  Also used heating massage pad to assist with pain relief. 1/15/21-1/16/21-Pain lessened in terms of intensity.  Had longer spells of less intense pain.  Also less pain with movement after resting/lying down.  However, pain still intense at this point.  Meds more helpful with the pain at this point as well.  On Sat, felt dizzy and unwell all day, including extra tired.  Hot, sweaty on Sat.  Racing heart, chest tightness.  Used inhaler and Metoprolol. 1/17/21-Felt unwell-intense pain still, dizziness, fatigue.  Took Meclizine 25 mg that morning.  Also took another 25 mg Meclizine later that afternoon.  Nausea, dry heaving to the point I almost vomited 2x.  After napping, nausea returned slightly but immediately went away.  Felt very tired remainder of the evening. 1/18/21-Went to MD to get clearance to return to work.  Dizziness prior to visit and took 1/2 25 mg Meclizine.  Felt better until I got to doctor&#39;s office.  While waiting to be called back, dizziness started up again and got severe.  While waiting on MD to come in and talk to me, I got nauseated and felt like I might dry heave/vomit.  I took another 1/2 Meclizine 25 mg and sucked on a mentholated cough drop to help with nausea, which did subside.  Dizziness continued to be severe.  MD took blood pressure, pulse ox, checked my ears, checked my pupils, listened to me breathe, asked me about my symptoms, return to work, and advised on safety of taking 2nd COVID injection when it is time but leaving it up to me in terms of if I feel benefits outweigh possible side effects of 2nd injection.  He prescribed anti-nausea meds, pain meds, and stated he wants to see me for a follow-up visit in 1 week.  He also prescribed steroid and pain med injections to be administered in office immediately, steroid injection sometimes contains Benadryl and based on how I felt after the shot, there may have been Benadryl in this one.  He also requested I message him later in the day to let him know how I was feeling.  Injections did GREATLY assist with pain and dizziness/foggy-headed feeling, once they kicked in.  I did message him letting him know how I was feeling after napping. 1/18/21 evening-I am still feeling weak and tired and having stinging like pain in both legs along with minor lower back pain.  Some chest and throat irritation as well as stomach discomfort.  Going to take a gentle laxative as well as some of the nighttime cold medicine I purchased.  Still also having dizziness on and off.  I plan to return to work tentatively, on 1/19/21, per my return to work note from MD.  I will keep my MD notified of how I feel between now and next Monday&#39;s follow-up.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

                                                Within 1 minute of my injection of the 2nd Pfizer dose, my throat started feeling itchy and scratchy, I couldn&#39;t clear it, this was at 2:30.  I was given a Claritin 10mg, 1 1/2 hrs later the sensation seemed to have cleared up. But 20mins later around 4:10pm my tongue started burning and tingling and within 15mins that sensation traveled to the back of my throat. Within 20mins from that I broke out in a rash on my chest, this was around 4:40. I was taken to ER and given 50mg Benadryl through the IV. My rash on my chest started going away but my throat and tongue still felt tingly and burning. It started barely clearing up around 8:45pm but it did not go away entirely, it is still here today 1/22/21 1:54pm, but not bothersome. It seems to be fading away as time goes. I will continue to take Benadryl at home every night until symptoms completely resolves.

At 9am fever of 101 started along with Hyper skin sensitivity and eye sensitivity and chills.  Aches turned into actual pain in my thighs and calves. It literally felt like I was hit with a baseball bat in my thighs.   Fever kept climbing all day to 103.9 at 3pm. Even though I was alternating Advil and Tylenol. During afternoon and evening I had extreme dizziness. Fever, chills, fatigue, hypersensitive skin and to sunlight with my eyes have persisted for another 24 hours.

                                                Sensation of fullness in back of throat, progressing to tingling sensation of mouth/face and upper body, and then tachycardia.   Became very nervous with the strange sensation and took pulse which was initially in normal range.  This however progressed to a rapid heart rate.  Overall symptoms lasted 3-4 minutes.  Pulled over and exited a busy highway.  Called 911 (2:22 pm) during symptoms and they said they could only call an ambulance.   Had some confusion when speaking to operator, as I couldn&#39;t tell them which exit I was at although I know the exit.  Ultimately, drove myself to the hospital parking lot (about 4-5 min away) as heart rate had started to return to normal.   Heart rate was in normal range when I rechecked in hospital parking lot.  Sat in car for about 5 minutes before deciding to drive back to vaccine clinic to report my symptoms.  Clinic about 3-4 minutes away.   Pulse ox was normal x 2.  BP was actually elevated x 2.   Waited 30 minutes before being released home.

The headache as also in my eyes and in my ears.  Back was also painful - not as bad as neck, but i can&#39;t explain how horribly a hope a massage could fix me.  There was no comfortable position to alleviate any of that.  I also got the chills, constantly, suddenly switching from shivering cold to so hot i needed to take blankets off - but soon as i took the blankets off I&#39;d be freezing cold again. I was also super nauseous, though i didn&#39;t vomit. I pretty much couldn&#39;t get out of bed much for 24-36 hours. During that time, i was unable to sleep as well, i think mostly due to the chills, constantly having to move about to keep warm or cool off, but not sure.      I did take acetaminophen around 10pm 1/26 (36 hours after injection)- i felt like I knew you&#39;re not supposed to, but I couldn&#39;t take it any more and it might have less anti-inflammatory impact than ibuprofen.  It dulled the pains some, but didn&#39;t make it stop. the chills and nausea mostly stopped and was able to sleep more the second night, last night.       I&#39;m now up and trying to work today (1/27). Head still has pressure headache throughout. Neck is still sore, like a pressure headache. I feel generally foggy and heavy.

                                                01/29/2021  930 noticed an itch on left thigh, like I wanted to hive - on various spots throughout the day. 01/30/2021 very tired (to be expected), noticed I had burning in what feels like my gall bladder and developed an ?odd? stomach ache later in the day. Thought it had to do with something I ate, but consumed nothing out of the ordinary. Went to bed early, felt like I wanted to fever but never did. decided to take a tsp of children?s Allegra because I still felt ? itchy? at times.  01/31/2021 woke up to what felt like pressure on my chest,  like someone was squeezing me. Thought that was odd and thought it was perhaps the way I slept. Was still tired (4AM) went back to sleep. Woke up again feeling more rested and the same feeling. It was an awful feeling. Grabbed my pulse oximeter and my oxygen was about 96 laying down. Called an. ER, thought maybe I had Covid or something as I have never felt that way before. Receptionist told me she felt the same way after she got the shot.  I ate, felt better but then developed a horrific headache akin to a migraine that was so sensitive to any movement I made. Felt like someone was shaking my head, it was so painful and I became disoriented. Like. I would get confused in my thoughts. Became very sensitive to light and movement. Looking at Facebook, I had to stop because I felt like I was going to seizure. Had to really rest. Ate lunch and took a multivitamin to see if that helped. Eventually I felt better but had to be careful, take it easy. 02/01/2021 woke up this morning still tired, like my body is fighting something. And I could fell the headache coming on and noticed I was getting confused in my thoughts. I decided to stay home from work. The morning was very bad as I felt as though I wanted to seizure. Could not get a hold of my doctor. My head still hurts, not as bad, but after I eat, I get confused and can?t hold two thoughts at once if that makes sense. Head seems very sensitive to eye movement like yesterday.  It?s a gross feeling, even in absence of the pain.

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, my throat started feeling really thick - hard to breathe. Felt like I was wheezing. Super shaky and dizzy. I gave myself my epi-pen. I notified them and they took me to ER - IV - Benadryl and Solumedrol . I got really shaky for about an hour afterwards and then they discharged me. It cleared up my throat issues. within 4 days, I had significant shortness of breath again and I was directed to ER Gave me evaluated me for a pulmonary embolism - I did not have one. They gave me Solumedrol again. They gave me a prednisone taper. And then a week after that - or two weeks after - the shortness of breath returned  - Dr had me go to ER room again - They gave me another prednisone taper which I&#39;m still on and I have significant fatigue still and 24/7 out of breath still. Currently: Flonase 50 mg - twice a day - Admerdiscus 100 mg  - twice a day

                                                I immediately felt skin and eye itchy after I received the vaccines. Stayed in the waiting room for 30 mins, felt better. Next day skin  itch got worse. Specially around my eyes.Eye itchy, rubbing, pain, vision blurry,  puffiness, discharged, I bought some allergy drops but it didn?t get better. , on the 7 days after the vaccine, it was a Saturday, it got so much worse  that I could barely open up my eyes. So I went to  a clinic. The nurse practitioner gave me eyes drop for infection, it did not get better. She prescribed another eye drop, still not working. Now my eyes feel horrible,.

                                                On 2/28 around 6pm. I started feeling some flu like symptoms start. Mild headache, fatigue, chills, slight runny nose, mild sore throat. My left eye suddenly felt awful. I told my husband my eye is stuck (open). It was very scary and I felt like I had to hold my hand against it tightly. Meanwhile my right eye just wanted to stay closed, so then I couldn?t see at all. My husband guided me into the kitchen and I tried to flush my eye with water to see if that would help whatever was going on with my eye lid. My husband gently rubbed the skin above my eye. He couldn?t see my  eye lid at all. All that was visible to him was the tip of my eyelashes. He was able to grab the tip of my eyelash and release my eyelid. It was very uncomfortable and scary.  After the eyelid was released the eye was very sore . I called the nurse line and they recommended I be seen within 24 hours. I saw the doctor this morning not related at all to the vaccination facility. She said it sounded like an ocular muscle spasm. She said she didn?t see anything in the vaccine literature about this type of response but recommended I report it in case it?s a rare response.  I have never had that happen before and I hope to never have it happen again.

                                                heart rate jumped up; thought she was going to pass out; eyes were blurry; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 43-year-old female consumer received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at single dose via an unspecified route of administration on left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Relevant medical history included autoimmune issues diagnosed in 2006-2007. Concomitant medications were not reported. After 4 days from vaccination on 14Feb2021 the patient experienced blurred vision, increased heart rate, and feeling that she will pass out (as such) . She went to the Emergency Room and they did two EKGs, two COVID tests, and blood work to check the enzymes in her blood for her cardiac muscle, but there was no reason, nothing they could find about why her heart rate spiked. Patient also reported that her heart rate went up from about 03:00PM up thru midnight last night, and was still not down completely, it was a little erratic, but it was better than it was. She was prescribed treatment at the hospital to bring her heart rate down, but they didn&#39;t want to give her more and risk lowering her blood pressure. Patient was monitored through the night, and she was supposed to see a cardiologist there but they didn&#39;t show up, so she put a phone call in to hers. She was admitted to the hospital overnight. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date.

A 43-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 06:30 (at the age of 43-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 (with taste and smell loss). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

The next day I lost my sense of smell which lasted about 1.5 week and my arm was sore, heavy and red at the injection site.  The soreness and the feeling of heaviness ended the next day but the redness stayed for about 5 days and changed to a bruise which then stayed for about 1 another week.  On the 29th I was given a COVID-19 test which came back positive. I noticed when I lay flat I cough alot but when I prop myself up I dont.

A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included cutaneous t-cell lymphoma from 2017 and ongoing, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing thyroid, covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date not ongoing (lasted about 1-1.5 months; she did not have any breathing problems) and blood cancer. Concomitant medication included bexarotene ongoing for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rosuvastatin ongoing for cholesterol, levothyroxine ongoing for thyriod. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID 19: positive in Nov2020, found out tested positive around holiday. Clinical course: onset about 26 hours after administered the first dose; onset as soon as she got back to work next day: 06Jan2021. The side effects were at their worst for at least 24-48 hours. Further described as all side effects occurred only on left side of her body: whole left side of face swelled up on 06Jan2021; left eye turned red on 06Jan2021; whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb on 05Jan2021; eye went black/left eye looked bruised on 05Jan2021; pressure in head on 06Jan2021; felt like someone squeezing her eyeball out on 06Jan2021, within the first 24-48 hours, her &#39;left leg went numb&#39;. She called to talk to physician and nurse who advised her to take Benadryl; which she did take and the Benadryl stopped the side effects; but she could not take a lot of Benadryl or anything because she was at work. She stayed at work because at least there were healthcare professionals, adults in case she passed out; at home she has 7 young children and is also raising her grandchild. The side effects did not completely go away. The arm thing was normal; The next day she was at work and had the swelling on left side of face; blackness around the eyes; arriving home she had headaches on 07Jan2021 and then her leg went numb for like 20 mins; the whole left side of her body went numb including even her vagina; left side of her body was so numb and weird and tingly feeling that she started panicking because she was driving on 06Jan2021. She calmed herself down thinking it&#39;s only the left side; you can drive with your right side to get home and be fine. It was more like left side of her body was asleep, tingling, she has never had that happen before. Everything else like the headache, flu feeling was about 48 hours later (on 07Jan2021). She had COVID already back in Nov2020 for about 1-1.5 months; the next side effects she had were like the COVID symptoms she had, like the chills and everything on 06Jan2021. She had the lethargic feeling again, her head was hurting, she felt extremely weak on 06Jan2021. Patient also felt nausea on 06Jan2021, Dizzy on 08Jan2021. Another doctor said it sounded like the side effects she experienced with the vaccine sounded like allergic reaction or Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient was asking the doctor if she could get like an Epi-pen or prescription Benadryl or something because she is afraid to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and not have something to respond to side effects with. The outcome of event whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb was recovered on 07Jan2021, for headaches was recovering, chills and nausea was recovered on 08Jan2021. Outcome of other events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140), intramuscularly on the arm on 19Dec2020 11:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tachycardia and stroke from 2019 and diabetes mellitus diagnosed in summer of 2020 and ongoing. Family medical history included father had type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medication included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) for diabetes. The patient previously took regular flu shot and had body aches; it did not happen at the year of report but in years past she did have it. The patient took the COVID vaccine for precaution as she was a healthcare worker/paramedic and stated there was no prescriber. She received the vaccination at a health department facility, not a military facility. She had no previous immunizations and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date as COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Dec2020 and after nine days, she tested positive for COVID-19 on 30Dec2020 and had an inpatient hospital stay. She mentioned she was so happy that she did not have any symptoms for those days. She stated that she got the shot on the 19th and later that evening was when she started having symptoms. She tried to sleep and it woke her up, she felt sleepy, tired and experienced headache on 19Dec2020 20:00 to 21:00. On 28Dec2020 23:00, she had an increased cough. She initially had increased cough from wearing mask and was having post nasal drip, then she got wet cough and that was when she decided to get tested. She went back and forth on dates; stated she was confused with the dates because of being in the hospital, it had been a while and the dates were all meshing in together. Her specimen was collected and they did the test on 29Dec2020 then found out that she tested positive for COVID virus with a COVID test nasal swab on 30Dec2020 17:30. She mentioned she lost weight after she got COVID, had no sense of taste or smell on unspecified dates. She did not know if it was related to her thyroid but she started losing hair and her heart rate started increasing on Monday, so they took her off all her meds and said the COVID was doing crazy things to the body. She had to go on Carvedilol for the sinus tachycardia and had high blood pressure now. This was all new after she tested positive. She has had bouts of tachycardia before and did have a heart monitor as she had a stroke last year. So those have never been persistent or symptomatic. If she did have a high heart rate, it always went down. This one was symptomatic. She did fine the whole week after the shot, just had that little bit of sleepiness, was tired, and had a headache. The patient reported near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism on 08Jan2021 14:30 to 15:00, which required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 10Jan2021 (2 days). ER or physician&#39;s office was required. She never went to the ER for the vaccination, it was just for the near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism that she went and was then admitted to hospital. She just got out of the hospital the day before report (10Jan2021), was there for two days and was still recovering. She was supposed to receive her second vaccination on the day of report however her doctor did not know if she should get the second dose due to double antibodies. She did not ask if she still had the virus or it went away. She has not been to work in two weeks. Outcome of the events tested positive for COVID virus was not recovered; near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism was recovered with sequel; sleepy, tired and headache was recovering; while the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

At approximately midnight woke up with severe chills, fever (103) , Body pain, Severe eye pain and nausea. Developed a headache and sweating throughout the night. Continued to administer Tylenol at regular intervals. Sweating was profuse in that pajamas needed to be changed twice. At this point it has been more than 24 hours and though the symptoms have reduced in severity, eyes are still very sore and still experiencing chills and low-grade fever off and on. I would?ve gone into urgent care but there was a huge snowstorm. The reaction was quite concerning and very surprising. There was literally only a sore arm and mildly at that from the first injection .

                                                Sat 5pm eyeballs began to hurt.  The entire eyeball was painfully sore.  At night I woke up with tongue that felt thick or swollen.  Then the next am woke up with aches, headache, chills, hot (suspected fever but did not get up and check) tiredness.  Spit up yellow fluid (thought it might be from GERD) and laided around all day.  Did not eat as stomach felt nauseated.   At 3 pm I ate half a sandwich and at 4 ate half a banana and drank some water and 1/4 of cup of sweet tea.  By 6pm I was really sick to my stomach got up and threw up sandwich and banana.  I thought I saw some blood but was not sure.  I continued to throw up and it became all blood (bright red) mixed with water.  This occured twice and then I called doctors office and the dr on call advised me to go to ER since urgent cares were closed.  I went to ER about 8:30pm with continued headache, nausea, lightheadedness.  I tried to tell ER dr that I was there mainly for throwing up blood.  I sat in waiting room.  ER dr saw me at 3am and gave me Zofran for nausea as i thought I was going to be sick and gave me EKG, Blood panel and Blood Pressure readings.  Told me I was mildly dehydrated. My BP was higher than I think I have ever seen it.

These symptoms stopped 1 hr after vaccine. Then, very slight rash on neck and chest the next day (2/28) red spots (no itching), no treatment. Today (3/1) the rash is lighter and many spots are gone.

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20&#39;s, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn&#39;t have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours. She confirmed this product was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date on it. She clarified she also had been taking the generic version of TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH, it was the Up and Up Brand acetaminophen (Lot#: P122699, Expiry Date: Nov2022) gel caps, 500mg. COVID-19 rapid test was negative on 23Feb2021; COVID-19 PCR test on 23Feb2021 was unknown results. Patient asked if there was a hotline she can call or an information number where she can talk to somebody about her symptoms. She also reported this to her doctor but the doctor made it clear since it was a private practice, they had limited information. The doctor did take down similar information, she just did not know if there was any further information or a hotline she could call. The outcome of events was unknown.

A 44-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm, on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from 2017 and ongoing, cosmetic filler injections got in her face within the last year and half or 2 years. Patient said that she knew that Allergan asked her doctor about her ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s as well. She takes medication for that. Patient also said that her white blood cell count runs low, like around 2 if they want to note that as an immune system thing and she confirmed that was an issue for her prior to receiving the COVID 19 vaccine. Family medical history included that her daughter has Hasimotos as well. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications for Hashimoto&#39;s disease. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EI1685) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 18Dec2020 at the year of 44 years at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. She said her doctor believes she is having a reaction with her fillers. She clarified fillers were like cosmetic injections got in her face. She thought the filler was called Allergan but she didn&#39;t have any other information about it. She did know her doctor did call Allergan and did a report with them. She thought it was like a big deal because it was not documented with Pfizer just with Moderna. She said the doctor was also going to call and report this as well. The doctor has not called yet but he said he was going to, she just left their office. Basically the places she had had filler injections within the last year and half or 2 years not have, under her right eye there was a large bump that was swollen and then the places that were called labial folds, the marionette lines where she had had filler there were all swollen and that was on the right side of her face and then on the left side the marionette lines were swollen as well so basically everywhere she had had filler injections were swollen except the left eye, the left eye is not swollen. And the places were swollen and hard. She first noticed the swelling yesterday 25Jan2021. The bump on her right eye was yesterday around 15:00 and then this morning (26Jan2021) it was much worse under her eye and she noticed the bumps on the right side at about 6 am this morning and around 9 am she began feeling it on the left side and it progressively has gotten worse since it started in all of those areas (26Jan2021). This case reported as serious. Patient did not visit Emergency Room, but she has been to 2 different physicians in physician office. No other vaccines administered on the same day as either dose of the suspect product. Patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was not recovered.    Reporter assessed event everywhere she had had filler injections are swollen except the left eye, her left eye is not swollen as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information a contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be fully excluded. Consideration should also be given to the contribution from the cosmetic filler injections. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 at 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included underactive thyroid. Concomitant medication included unspecified thyroid medication. The patient was asking if her symptoms were normal following the vaccination. She got the second dose of the COVID vaccine yesterday, 07Mar2021 at around 11:00 (also reported as 10:00 to 10: 15 or 10:30). Throughout the day, she was fine and mentioned that she had soreness on her arm later. At around 22:00, she was driving home and started feeling a slight headache and reported that she didn&#39;t take anything. She was tired, so when she got home, the patient fell asleep. She woke up and did feel a slight headache and couldn&#39;t sleep on her left arm because it was killing her, but it was fine. At 5:30 this morning (08Mar2021), the headache was still there. She then stood and sat up, took her thyroid pill because she has an underactive thyroid and was on the highest dose of thyroid replacement. The patient stated that the events happened so fast, as soon as she got into the shower. She got out of bed and started walking, grabbed her stuff to shower and started feeling that her headache was building up more than it had all morning so far. She thought maybe it was just because she had just physically gotten up and started walking. She got into the shower, and for about 2-3 minutes into getting into the shower, she remembered she had started putting shampoo into her hands; grabbing the shampoo bottle; but she suddenly got so nauseous and the headache that came on was extreme. She did not have a lot of time to react. She thought she would throw up in the shower, she had no time to get out of the shower to the toilet to throw up; she suddenly felt dizzy, passed out in the shower and fell to her left side on the floor. All she could remember before she passed out was that she had the shampoo bottle in her hands and she said out loud, she heard herself say &#34;What is happening to me&#34;. Then she lost all the strength in her arms and legs. She remembered for a split second she tried to hold on, she dropped the shampoo bottle on the floor and grabbed the rail or edge of the shower and tried to hold on because she felt herself when she went down. Her left ear was completely clogged up only on the left side. When she passed out, thankfully she thought by trying to hold on to the rail or edge of the shower that she kind of eased her fall down, so she did not fall hard or hit her head. She did not know if she passed out for seconds or minutes because she has no idea exactly when she went into the shower, maybe around 05:45; but when she woke up she realized she was on the floor, she was not flat on the floor but on her knees, having fallen to the left side with her head off to the side on the shower wall; the glass door to her shower was wide open and all the water was coming out of the shower; it scared her when she woke up. The outcome of the event passed out was recovered on 08Mar2021, not recovered for headache, and unknown for all other events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

At 70 minutes after shot administration, felt itchy on limbs, then trunk and neck, then ears, eyes and into scalp. Symptoms progressed over the next 2 hours (flushed neck and then lips felt tingly and numb). At 7:30 my soft palate started to feel numb and I started to have some difficulty swallowing. Went to ER. Symptoms continued. After IV meds given swallowing difficulty continued to worsen so I was given a low dose shot of Epi. Swallowing improved (not to normal but not as severe) over the next hour but itchiness returned. It is now 8:00pm on 1/9/2021 and I continue to have itchiness, my tongue and soft palate are still numb but I am able to swallow fairly well and my entire face has decreased sensation to touch.

January 4, 2021- The slight numbness in tongue continued and my face started to feel a little different too. I had headaches on and off throughout the day and evening. January 5, 2021- Woke up to get ready for work and noticed that my right eyelid was a little swollen and the right side of my mouth looked different. I arrived at work and my right eye was not closing properly and I was having difficulty blinking. I left work an hour later and went to ER to seek treatment. I was prescribed Prednisone and Valacyclovir for a seven day course.  The first time I had Bells Palsy was in 1997 when I was 22 years old.

Vision was more blurry without my glasses but could not wear my glasses which made the blurriness worst.  Had pressure behind my eyes with a mild headache along with sensitivity to light.  The next day 11/05/2021, had my eyes checked by the eye doctor who indicated that everything was normal, eye pressure and response to light.  He did put a numbing eye drop in my eye that made the eye pressure relieve for a couple hours but when that wore off, I could feel the pressure behind my eyes.  On 11/06/2021, my eye and vision were back to normal

                                                I received the shot at 2 o?clock. By 2:05 my tongue and the back of my throat started tingling and burning like it had been scolded. It was reported after 30 minutes.  25 mg of Benadryl was given PO at 2:35. I started to develop a cough and was clearing my throat but had no difficulty breathing. At 3:05 another 25mg of Benadryl po was given. I was monitored until 4:30 PM. I was sent home. By 630 the sensation had started to increase again. I took 25 mg of Benadryl PO again. By 7 PM I was not having any relief so I spoke with my physician and he advised me to take 25 mg of Benadryl PO and the first row of a steroid dose pack. By midnight the symptoms had started to reoccur. I took another 50 mg of Benadryl. I finished the medrol dose pack on Wednesday, January 13th but still have the raw sensation on my tongue.

Worsening chills until midnight, then complete body ache, muscles, joints, everything, terrible headache.  Was on couch and walked upstairs.  By the time I got there, I was nearly vomiting and on the verge of losing consciousness.  I laid down on the cold tiles and tried to stay conscious. I couldn&#39;t even talk.  Saliva was pouring out of my mouth uncontrollably.  After awhile it let up enough to scoot into the bedroom and climb into bed.  Then an entire night of worsening chills, fever, aches, eye pain, sore throat, pulsating ringing in my ears.  Little if any sleep. I tried to get up and sit in a chair this morning at 3am and within minutes was so nauseated and light headed I had to lay back down flat. Tried to drink some hot tea and Gatorade at 5am.  Thought I heard someone walking around the house and then realized it was heartbeat pounding in my ears.  This morning my feet are super sensitive, I have urinary frequency and urgency, and the pulsatile tinnitus is back.  Later today had episode of sharp chest pains front to back that resolved after about five minutes.  Treatment has been rest today.

The next morning my right ear swelled , was red and covered in hives and very painful.  It continued to swell over next few days, very painful. I was feeling drained and had gastrointestinal symptoms for days and this morning woke up with my face swollen and another rash and hives on my face. I had a little trouble breathing as well and went to an Urgent Care. The doctor believes I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and administered a steroid injection and prescribed steroids and antihistamines.

                                                About 25 min after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a little tingling on my lips and my cheeks and my face felt heavy. I looked myself in the mirror, my face, cheeks and neck became very red like beet red and warm to the touch. I returned to the vaccine site and they observed me but the symptoms worsened, my eyes started getting puffy/ my cheeks started getting purple instead of red, and they sent me to the ER. At the ER they continued to monitor me and gave me IV Benadryl and IV Pepcid and IV steroids and said I had a delayed case of hives. Once I had all the IV medication the swelling went down and the hives on my arms and my back went away, the redness in my face and neck stayed until next day and I noticed after taking a warm shower the next day the redness returned on other parts of my body. I took a Benadryl. About after 2 days it was all resolved.

                                                Started to feel bad when I left after 15 minutes wait time. Upon leaving I almost pulled into the hospital parking lot to wait, but decided to try and drive home. I began to feel light headed, dizzy, dry mouth, it felt hard to swallow. I knew I did not feel well so I drove myself to the fire station that was closest to me. They took my blood pressure upon arrival and it  was 141/93.  My normal blood pressure is around 116/63, so it was considerably high. I do not have a history of high blood pressure. The morning of the vaccination I had, had a very small cup of coffee and had eaten a piece of raisin bread. I had also taken two 250 mg generic acetaminophen tablets with 65mg caffeine prior to the vaccination. I also experienced chills and a low grade fever of 100 degrees.

A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EK570), via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she felt yucky afterwards on 23Dec2020, experienced shortness of breath on exertion and coughing on 26Dec2020; chills, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, body aches, fever on 28Dec2020; loss of taste, loss of smell and COVID-19 pneumonia on 07Jan2021.  All the events were reported as being medically significant.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 29Dec2020.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia and included: started on bronchodilator, cough elixir, steroids and azithromycin (ZITHROMAX).  The outcome of muscle pain, body aches and COVID-19 pneumonia was recovering and of loss of taste and loss of smell was not recovered.  The causality of the suspect vaccine to the events was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

I then became lightheaded and dizzy and my hands and lips/cheeks became numb and tingling and I got very shaky. I summoned paramedics who came and took vitals and my heart rate was in 130s with blood pressure of 190/100, I have no prior history of high blood pressure or high resting heart rate. Blood pressure came down to normal level within 30 minutes, other symptoms improved and I was cleared to leave vaccination site. Intermittent numbness in face and hands and general shakiness persisted through the next 12 hours and heart rate stayed 100-120 for 12 hours before returning to my normal rate of 60.

                                                DAY 1 (Thurs. 1/14/21 - received 2nd dose of the vaccine at 8:49 am central time): 15 MINS POST SHOT: acute tingling around mouth and tongue; BP spiked and face became very flushed. Waited with nurse until 1 hour post shot. BP stayed above normal all day, as did fatigue. 12 HOURS POST SHOT: sever headaches warranting migraine medicine but I only took Tylenol and Ibuprofen since Maxalt (10 mg) can raise BP. Alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen every 3 hours but would only get about 2 hours of relief each time. This continued through the night.   DAY 2 (Fri. 1/15/21): 23 HOURS POST SHOT: Headache remained. but was lessened after taking Mucinex D. Extremely fatigued, which remained throughout the day.  24 HOURS POST SHOT (9:00 am): Saw NP at clinic, BP was normal.  Was prescribed Fioricet, ESGIC 50-325-40 and advised to take it if headache returned. If ineffective after 2 hours, advised to take Maxalt 10 mg. 10:10 am: took Fioricet with no impact to headache, took Maxalt at 12:10. 28  HOURS POST SHOT: Severe, painful heartburn in my chest and  upper back - Mylanta provided no relief.  Headache returned and started having severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath. 29 HOURS POST SHOT (~2PM) Went to urgent care; vitals were all normal. Received fluids and &#34;GI cocktail&#34; containing lidocaine. Heartburn pain subsided but headaches and abdominal pain. Was advised to go to Emergency Department and did. ED ran multiple labs and ECG to rule out gallbladder, pancreas, etc. Headaches and abdominal pain at this point were excruciating and debilitating. Shortness of breath was significant. ED staff said they have seen the different reactions I was having to the vaccine, just not all together in one patient at the same time. Pain subsided after fluids with Benadryl, Toradol and Reglan. Was discharged approximately 4 hours after arrival. MD prescribed Reglan for continued headaches through the weekend.  DAY 3 (Sat. 1/16/21): 48  HOURS POST SHOT: Severe headache when I awoke. Reglan did not provide relief. After two hours, took Maxalt 10 mg . Headaches and significant fatigue continued with such severity I took Maxalt as frequently as allowed per dosing instructions. I stayed in a dark room until Monday (1/18/21, Day 5), ensuring I was staying well hydrated and nourished. The fatigue was so significant that movement was very labored. It should be noted that I am a very active person and I had zero energy and missed two days of work (Fri and Mon).  DAY 4: headaches were less frequent  DAY5 (Mon. 1/18/21): At 3:30 PM (~126 hours post shot) - it was like someone flipped a light switch and the fatigue and headaches were gone and I felt like I was back to normal.   DAYS 6-7, (Tues. and Wed 1/19-20/21) - worked a normal day at work.  DAY 8 (Thu. 1/21/21): extremely fatigued again, like over the weekend, but it only lasted today.  Of note, the lips and tongue tingling would come and go following the initial weekend of severe reactions. While noticeable, it was not as significant as within the first 15 mins of receiving the dose.  On Monday 1/25/21 at approximately 3:00 PM, the tingling was very noticeable and my BP spiked again. Since that time until now, I have had no reactions.

A 45-year-old female physician received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EK9231, Expiry: Apr 2021), intramuscularly in the left deltoid on 30Dec2020 at 16:30 (at the age of 45-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heartburn. Concomitant medications included (dexlansoprazole) DEXILANT for heartburn from an unspecified date (reported as a year and a half). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 31Dec2020, the patient experienced dizziness with visual disturbances. She was having increasingly more and more dizziness with visual disturbances where today (20Jan2021) she felt nauseous from that. It was impairing her from driving because she felt things were moving that weren&#39;t and made her panic on the interstate, as of an unspecified date. It. Initially it was bothering her while driving, but now she noticed it while sitting at her desk or when she ate. It was all the time now. The reporter assessed the events &#34;increasingly more and more dizziness with visual disturbances/she feels things are moving that aren&#39;t&#34; as being between disabling and medically significant. The patient did not visit the emergency room or a physician&#39;s office, although stated it probably did require it. The patient queried whether to receive the second dose today as her symptoms were worsening. The clinical outcome of &#34;increasingly more and more dizziness with visual disturbances/she feels things are moving that aren&#39;t&#34; was not resolved, and of nauseous, &#34;impairing her from driving/ bothering her while driving&#34; and panic were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship causality between events dizziness with visual disturbances and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

                                                Constricted throat. I was given Zyrtec. Observed for an hour. Got discharged. Throat constriction didn&#39;t go away until 2 hours afterwards. Puffy, itchy eyes (both eyes) with rash came and lasted about two weeks. Monday or Tuesday, I noticed a rash all over my body - red and blotchy. That went away in a day. I got chills, fever, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and that lasted 48 hours (16th in pm-17th and got better evening of 18th). When I had the rash was all over the body, I took a Zyrtec. The weekend I was really sick I didn&#39;t take any medication.  Phone visit with Doctor  - January 15th - allergist - I followed up with him about the throat constriction. He just was monitoring symptoms. After the weekend that I was really sick,  I told him and he ordered bloodwork.

Fever was down to about 102.4°, feet were still burning and my face and eyes were swollen. I took more ibuprofen and put used cold compress on my eyes. Around 4:30am I woke up with abdominal pain and pain in my hips. Fever was lower, eyes were better but face still swollen and feet still burning. I called off work at that time. By about 8am fever broke and have just had an intense headache.

                                                ringing in the ears; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as one injection to left arm) on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy. Concomitant medication included prednisolone acetate (PREDNISOLONE ACETATE, Manufacturer: Pacific Pharma. NDC: 60758119-05, Lot: E88990, Exp. date: Feb2023) 1%, four eyedrops a day until she is out, 7 days at most or a week for allergy. The nurse called as a patient about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, which she received on 16Dec and had a headache - only a slight headache, the day after and ringing in her ears that has not gone away. She says it was her first injection of the vaccine. The patient says she was given the vaccine through her work, and says she had a headache that evening and then a slight headache the next day. She says that the ringing in the ear, she noticed the next day in the morning. She says it is hard to tell if the ringing is just one ear or not, the ringing is staying about the same, and is more in her right ear. She says she has not had treatment for either the headache or the ringing in her ears, and the headache improved on its own. She had no new medications and didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines when she got this one. She says that she went to the eye doctor in the past week and he started her on eye drops, she has never been on prednisone for allergies, and for her eyes he gave her prednisone drops and allergy drops. She says she started that medication on the evening she got it, Monday 21Dec. She would like to know if there could be some type of allergy, she doesn&#39;t know if she should take the second dose of the vaccine. She says she doesn&#39;t know if there is something she should do for the ringing in her ears, like a common treatment or anything, or if others have been reporting this. She says she saw on the website that one side effect said ringing in ears, but she isn&#39;t sure if the website was either of those provided by call handler for further information. The outcome of the events slight headache was resolving while ringing in the ears had not resolved.

A 46-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK5730, Expiration Date Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in her right deltoid on 19Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Crohn&#39;s disease from 2007/ diagnosed at 33 years old. There were no other concomitant drugs. The doctor who received the COVID vaccine stated that she must had been exposed to the virus prior to receiving the vaccine because she became symptomatic 48 hours after getting the vaccine. She noted that on Pfizer website recommended that a person not get the vaccine until 6 weeks after active infection but she of course did not know she had been exposed and when her second dose was due, she would not be 6 weeks after active infections. The vaccine was received on 19Dec2020 and she tested positive on 22Dec2020. The only symptoms she had experienced after testing positive are nasal congestion and loss of smell and they started on 21Dec2020 in the morning. She had had no worsening of her Crohn&#39;s disease. The only testing she had had done was the PCR testing for COVID. No treatments for the symptoms at this point. The outcome of the events tested positive COVID was not recovered, while for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal role of BNT162B2 would seem unlikely based on the temporal gap between the vaccination therapy and the event onset.

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

At 1000 on 1/8/21 began having a headache that worsened to a severe migraine throughout the day.  Also that afternoon, developed sores/ulcers inside of mouth.  Next day developed worsening sores in mouth and then my tongue began to swell and then noted sores on my tongue as well.  This improved with Benadryl over the next 36 hrs.

                                                After waiting in the waiting area for about 20 minutes following the vaccination, I left to return to my car and go home.  While walking through the hospital, I started to feel weird - almost light headed and fuzzy.  By the time I got to the hospital entrance, my tongue had started to tingle and swell (I don&#39;t know that it ACTUALLY swelled, but that&#39;s how it felt) and I was concerned about losing the ability to breath.  I started going back to the vaccination site, but the feeling started to subside.  After about another 15 minutes, the feeling was gone.  I did NOT report this to the vaccination site and instead just proceeded home.

                                                The day after I received a vaccine, I had higher than usual blood pressure and pulse rate. I also had a muscle pain in the arm and I felt tired during the day and in the evening. My pulse rate continues to be high. My pulse rate was 100 on the second day and for number of days it is around 95. Today it was 95 most of the day. I have not been regularly checking my pulse rate before, but based on what I found in some information in my medical record, it is most likely around 75. I notice the higher pulse rate through pulsation in the chest and temples. I have a hard time concentrating on work and reading things on the screen.

Went to ER and they first thought I had wax in it - couldn&#39;t hear after they flushed it with warm water. Didn&#39;t change anything . Did a brain MRI - and that was negative. Did some bloodwork - and it all came back okay. After all that - 6 hrs there: Prednisone - 60 mg a day for 10 days. After 24 hours of taking that my hearing was back -  there was huge improvement. I Still have very loud ringing in my ear. Constant buzz in my ear. Had a hearing test to test and it looks pretty good. Going back in three months for hearing test.

After presenting to the ED, she was found to be hemodynamically stable with no further complaint in regards to pain, fever, nausea/vomiting, rash or other systemic responses. Airway appeared to be intact. Patient had a tryptase lab drawn (4ug/l which was within normal limits). Patient had a distant history of hives although the med/agency was unknown. No other signs of allergic reaction.  Speaking in a clear voice. Maintaining good oxygen saturation. less likely anaphylaxis. Given 50 mg of Benadryl in triage. Pt Observed for 3 hours after the vaccine for progression of the swelling.  Patient continued to do well and was sent home with follow up occupation health regarding recommendations regarding the second dose in 3 weeks. Given the limited nature of exam findings, mild form of vaccine reaction could not be ruled out. However, the cause of her symptoms could also be due to other factors including food (no detailed history on this).

                                                Had soreness in the arm for two days. On the 26th, evening, I went to take drink of water and some of spilled down my face and I thought I just had a fat lip. 27th, I went to work and went to lunch at noon, I went to eat food and I noticed that my mouth -right side was numb. I thought something might be wrong and someone told me that my right side of my face looked slack. Saw on Dec 28, Dr. - had already scheduled an appt for follow up for diabetes - and I told her about my symptoms and she looked at my face and had me smile and crinkle my face. She sent me to my doctor downstairs (she had the nurse call downstairs and told them I needed to be seen that day). I went downstairs and I saw my doctor and my doctor scheduled an MRI on 28th at 7 PM and also ordered for me to take Prednisone and Valtrex. MRI result came back fine. I responded well to both of these meds - I started to get muscle control back into my face. It shot my sugar numbers up but solved the other problem in about 15 days I could shut my eyes without delay and I feel like I have muscle control in my face. January 22, I got the second dose and so far I don&#39;t notice anything different.

She had a headache coming to the clinic which she had taken excedrine for prior to arriving.  We took her blood pressure about 10 minutes after vaccination and it was 150/88 HR 130.

Five days later, I was walking down a hallway at the hospital (I am a physician) when all of a sudden I experienced vertigo (I was not dizzy, but I felt my vision shift to the left). I fell down, landing  against 2 crash carts that were in the hallway. I did not lose consciousness. I had persistent dizziness and nausea for at least 10 days afterwards.

                                                sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss worse on one side; tinnitus; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 46-years-old female patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular into right arm on 05Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization. Time the vaccination was reported as 10:00-10:30. Medical history included food and environmental allergies. The patient had a history of autoimmune antibodies to thyroid but with normal thyroid numbers. No medication was needed, but autoimmune antibodies was found in the past. She had a propensity for autoimmune disease, it was just not active. She was diagnosed the first time she found auto antibodies 12 years before 19Jan2021 (2009) and checks her thyroid yearly and they had been normal. She still had antibodies, but thyroid hormone levels are normal without intervention. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Historical vaccine included Pneumovax 30 days before getting the COVID vaccine (06Dec2020, 46-years-old). Her pneumonia titers were low. Historical vaccine also included flu shot, she felt sick but like everyone else, she did not consider that abnormal. She thought most people felt kind of down and it did not have long term effects. It did not require any doctor visits. She did not have a rash or anaphylaxis. The patient was a physician and well versed in terms of symptoms. By evening of 05Jan2021, she developed tinnitus, which she had never had and has been there ever since. She was on day 13 post vaccine and still having bilaterally, every day and it never went away. She had a physician visit on 12Jan2021 and hearing test performed that day. They did find sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss worse on one side, her test confirmed bilateral hearing loss at 11:00 on 12Jan2021. It was mild so far in the high frequency ranges. So, they gave option to start 14 day course of high dose steroids with steroid injections into the ear, because in some cases of acute hearing loss, it can curb or reduce it. She decided to do that. Now she was going to be on steroids. She would be temporarily immunosuppressed. She did not know if that will affect the vaccine. She had not decided if she will get second shot. It is due next week, but she was a little nervous. She was considering delaying the booster a couple months out to see if more information develops. She provided her weight as between 175 to 180lb. Right now, the hearing loss was mild and it won&#39;t be that bad, but normally, it was permanent, which would be disabling hearing loss. She was going 20Jan2021, for the steroid injection in the ear canal. That would be the first injection. She was taking oral steroids now. They would see if this limits the progression. The events outcome was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possible causality between the reported tinnitus/sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, cannot be fully denied based on the reasonable temporal association.

I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

                                                On Sunday I started with a severe headache. When I woke up on Monday morning I couldn&#39;t lift my head. The headache was intense. I could not open my left eye. I had facial paralysis on the right side of my face. I had slurring of speech. When I walked I was dizzy. I fell asleep all day long, and woke up each time completely disoriented.

                                                In the first 5 mins after the injection I became very irritable and then within 10 mins had a cold sensation in my head that I had previously had after a reaction to sulfa and had almost passed out.  I told a staff person who had me talk to one of the nurses &amp; put me in a separate space from people getting vaccinated.  The nurses then wasted a lot of time talking to me about anxiety instead of treating me.  The cold sensation traveled from my head down my neck, there was a sharp pain in my left breast, and then my heart started racing.  My lips and tongue on the left side started swelling.  I told the nurses this but they ignored me.  Eventually they brought in equipment to monitor my vital signs.  My blood pressure  and heart rate were higher than I had ever seen them and kept rising.  The head nurse eventually said I needed medical care &amp; there was no doctor on site.  She called the paramedics.  It was now 1 hour after I told them something was wrong.  The paramedics thought this was temporary because my bp fell to 153 [I told them I did not have a hist of bp this high]  from where it had been before &amp;   gave me Benadryl pills. (The ER doctor later said they should have done something).  Later that night my HR went up to 220 and I was taken to the ER.  The ER doctor also wasted time assuming it was anxiety but bloodwork showed I was in shock.  They first treated me with 4 aspirin, then Atavan, which all did nothing.  My bp was up to 189 the last time I could view the monitor.  Sodium chloride ivs, Bendaryl ivs were given after the bloodwork.  Diltiazem was eventually also given. I had palpitations that caused my entire body to shake. EKG showed I had developed an atrial flutter and the doctor said the flutter, arrhythmia, and tachycardia were caused by the shock from the vaccine disrupting the electrical signals in my heart.  I stayed overnight in the ER until Sat morning.  I took Diltiazem but jolting palpitations and tremors did not stop.  I saw a cardiologist on the 25th who concluded I had gone into shock from the vaccine, and I was given the wrong medication, and put me on metropolol.  Metoprolol lowered my bp and reduced the palpations.  I weaned off it with the doctor&#39;s permission.  I still have palpitations.

There were no other secondary systemic/organs affected apart from mild transient hypertension. Given the strong concern for subjective airway compromise, I directed the administration of epi which the patient said she felt her throat relax after adminstration. 911 was called and patient was transported to ED.

A 46-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8732), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Mar2021 at 10:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included celiac disease and asthma. The patient had allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication(s) (received within 2 weeks of vaccination) included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), Dexalant and birth control pill. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the was not patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 26 Mar2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat, my blood pressure was high, my throat was closing, she experienced body aches and at home she started wheezing/bilateral wheeze. Within minutes of receiving the vaccine, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat and she had a weird sensation in her throat, 15 minutes later she was not able to form words. The patient was given liquid Benadryl (oral) for my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat and her symptoms resolved. She went to the nurse station, who took her BP which was high, which it normally is not so the treating physician felt confident in letting me go home. She was monitored for an hour and was sent home with no more tongue swelling. At home she started wheezing. She called her HCP and was advised to take a nebulizer with no effect. At around 14:00, when the Benadryl wore off, her throat was closing so she was directed to epi-pen herself and call 911. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital and treated for anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. She was given prednisone 50mg by mouth daily for four days and a refill for her Epipen. No additional Epipen was administered. On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced skin hurting like a neuropathy, chills and she experienced a rash. On an unknown date in Mar2021, she experienced bronchospasm, upper airway swelling, respiratory distress, dry cough, hoarse voice and difficulty breathing (without wheeze or stridor). No sneezing or rhinorrhea. She was treated with adrenaline, corticosteroids, antihistamine, IV fluids, Oxygen, bronchodilators and other. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The administering doctor not to take the second vaccine. The outcome of the events anaphylactic reaction, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat, my blood pressure was high and my throat was closing was recovered with sequealae, skin hurting like a neuropathy, she experienced body aches, at home she started wheezing/bilateral wheeze, chills and she experienced a rash was recovered and bronchospasm, upper airway swelling, respiratory distress, dry cough, hoarse voice and difficulty breathing (without wheeze or stridor) was unknown.  Follow up attempts are needed.

This 47-years-old female nurse reported that she received BNT162B2 (lot EL0140) 1st dose intramuscular at Left Deltoid on 28Dec2020 9:38 for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was none. Concomitant drug was not provided. The patient reported in the evening on 28Dec2020, she noticed her tongue swelling. She started to notice her tongue swelling shortly after dinner, probably around 6:30-7 in the evening. She was a little bit on pins and needles regarding this reaction. It happened quite a few hours later after receiving the vaccine. She was thinking should she go to urgent care or emergency room or not. Her tongue was still swollen but it seemed like over the week, the swelling had gotten better. However, the swelling came back. So really overall, the swelling hasn&#39;t gotten much better. She hasn&#39;t been drooling due to the swelling. She hasn&#39;t had issues with eating, drinking, swallowing or breathing. She just had ridges around her tongue. Her tongue felt a little bit heavy. The question she had was how long was this going to take before the swelling went away and was it safe her to take the booster shot (second vaccine)? The swelling was still persisting.  The outcome of the event was not resolved.

                                                About 36 hours after vaccination, I experienced incredible &#34;brain&#34; fatigue/fog. My physical body did not seem affected by the fatigue but my brain/head felt very &#34;fuzzy&#34;. I had a hard time getting words out. Similar feeling to etoh intoxication. I was a bit off balance and dizzy. I remember shaking my head to try to clear it. I also had a very&#34;plastic&#34; taste in my mouth and felt nauseous. At the 48 hour mark (almost exactly) I felt better. At 60 hour mark brain/head symptoms completely resolved. Only experienced a very slight nauseated feeling.

Within 2-3 minutes mouth, tongue and throat started to swell. 50 mg of Benadryl was given. Started to feel better but 45 minutes later swelling started back up. Dryness in mouth still there and water couldn?t quench my thirst. Escorted to Emergency department. Epinephrine shot given 40mg of prednisone, 20 mg of Pepcid and 10 mg of Zyrtec given. Given another 20mg of prednisone, 10 mg of Pepcid and 10 mg of Zyrtec 1.5 hours later. Release after 4.5 hours. Given 3 days of medicine previously given. Swelling started back up 6 hours later so I took 50 mg of Benadryl. Swelling continued every 6-8 hours. Mouth was still really dry but as long as I drank 100 oz of water a day I was ok.   Tuesday I had a small fever and very achy. Went to doctor and he prescribed 20 mg of prednisone twice daily tapering off for 11 days, 10 mg of Pepcid and Zyrtec twice daily for 11 more days.  Finished my medicine Saturday January 2nd. I have been feeling better but still have swelling occasionally.

This lasted for about 20-25 minutes and then  mostly resolved.  I was monitored by the paramedics.  I had normal vitals at the time of evaluation which was soon after notifying staff. After the 1st injection I had a similar episode, but I thought it was anxiety related.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, also reported as &#34;for work.&#34; The patient has no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine on 22Dec2020. She was scheduled to receive the second on 12Jan2021, Tuesday. Since receiving the vaccine, the night of receiving it, she developed a clicking sensation in her right ear. It hasn&#39;t gone away. It was kind of like &#34;when you have water in your ear.&#34; It is not popping like on an airplane. She can trigger it if she hums or makes her vocal cords vibrate. She can make it happen. It is not painful. She notices it a lot at night. It might be a eustachian tube thing. At first, she was wondering if it could be coincidental. She hasn&#39;t experience it before though. It could be related to a sinus thing. But she hasn&#39;t realized a sinus issue. She thought, by now it would have gone away. No one has looked in her ear though. She works in healthcare. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at work. She noticed the clicking in the middle of night so she can&#39;t say an exact time of onset. She thought it might have been improving, but she thinks she is just getting used to it. She is less aware of it now. The patient asked if she should be seen by her HCP or have her ears checked out. She asked if the clicking sound that developed in her ear after getting the first dose of the vaccine was normal? It is persistent like &#34;if you have water in your ear.&#34; It happens mostly at night but is happening right now. The patient further reported having the expected side effects of headache, fatigue and feeling run down since an unknown date. The patient has not recovered from the event &#34;developed a clicking sensation in her right ear/ persistent like &#34;if you have water in your ear&#34;/ notices it a lot at night/ happens mostly at night but is happening right now.&#34; Outcome of the events &#34;headache&#34; and &#34;fatigue and feeling run down&#34; was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was vaccinated at 3:30pm .  At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:00 in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Patient take medications for mood and sleep with were very low doses. But she didn&#39;t have any medical problem. She took 10 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), 150 mg of bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) and 10 mg of doxepin for sleep. Yesterday after the vaccination towards the end of the day (09Jan2021 approximately 11 o&#39; clock am), she developed a stomach ache about 5 pm and it went on throughout the night and she normally didn&#39;t have issues with her stomach. Maybe it was because she was hungry because she went ice skating with her son where they wore mask in the afternoon yesterday and she was feeling perfectly fine. But when she came home, she noticed her stomach started hurting at 5 pm and she wondered maybe it is because she was hungry. And after she ate it was still bothering her and then it got progressively worst in the middle of the night where it would wake her up periodically. But she was so fatigue that she was able to sleep still. But she noticed in the middle of the night that her stomach would wake her up because it was aching and cramping in the middle of the night. And then she also had some sweating in the middle of the night as well as some pain behind her eyes. And today (10Jan2021) she had some fatigue which she noticed was not usual, she had mild headache which she saw was a common side effect. And then in the morning (10Jan2021) some fatigue and weakness like when she walked to the bathroom it was hard for her to walk. And when she went to use the bathroom she had some loose stools which was not common for her unless at all she was sick or have eaten something that makes her stomach really sick which was very unusual for her. Her stomach was still hurting her, if she walked it will start getting cramped so she was sitting down. The only thing she toon this morning was 2 acetaminophen medicine tablets because she was having pain behind her eyes when she woke up. She was just going to say she had influenza type A and type B on several occasions. And these symptoms are similar to when she had type B influenza, which was not as difficult as type A. So this is, they seemed to be like a mild version of type B influenza which she had terrible stomach issues, diarrhea and fatigue and pain behind the eyes from type B influenza. She had not any sickness because she work from home and she had limited field contact. So, she hadn&#39;t had illness from past year now. Because she worked from home. She provided mental health counselling remotely. So, she didn&#39;t think it could be attributed from anything else. The left on arm which was up toward like shoulder area and it was sore but it was tolerable in Jan2021. Outcome of stomach ache/stomach cramping was not recovered, and outcome of other events were unknown.

A 47-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Sinus infection, Kidney stones, pink eye when she was a kid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She reports the following side effects: itchy, red and swollen eyes, itchy throat, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip). The patient experienced Right eye itching, red and swollen eyes/right eye swollen, Right eye pink on 08Jan2021 with outcome recovering, right eye shut on 09Jan2021 with outcome of received on 09Jan2021, itching throat, mucus from throat, clear mucus, Right eye weeping on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered/resolved with sequel on 11Jan2021, Left eye itching on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip) on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Jan2021, right eye red/ right Eye being Red on 09Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021. The patient got her First shot on Thursday morning at 7:30AM, then on Friday night 08Jan2021 at 7 in the evening her right eye was itching and weeping, it felt like something was in the eye but there wasn&#39;t. The right eye was swelling as well on Friday. On Friday the itching of the throat started.  She is also having scratchiness in the throat. Her eye is scratchy also. When she woke up Saturday 09Jan2021 she couldn&#39;t open the right eye, it was glued shut completely and red. When she was a kid, in the past she has had pink eye, and there was green stuff coming out the eye but this was not like previously. She had to pull the eye lids apart, maybe this is viral.  With her throat, she has had sinus infection in the past before in which she couldn&#39;t breath out of the nose, but with this she is experiencing Mucus that is clear and thin from the throat. Her left eye itching started Friday night, but it was only slight itchiness and by Saturday the left eye was normal. She is purely doing this report to help, in case other people have this happen. Early today, she did use a Neti pot and it did help a little, she has had horrible sinus infections in the past but this is not it. In the past, once you get a sinus infection you are prone to getting them, thankfully she has not had one in a few years, she would get thick crap in the sinuses, in this case her eye was draining going into her nose, therefore making her have a runny nose, and she also had scratching in the throat. She is breathing clearly through the nose. Itching in the right eye was ongoing but less intense. Right Eye Swollen: She was looking at mirror hates looking at herself but the eyelid was back to normal, however the white part of eye is still swollen. Right eye being Shut: It is open now, that was a one day occurrence. Itching in the throat: She noticed that today at noon around 1 is when she last had it, it is 5% still there where she feels something. Mucus from Throat: She used the Neti pot a couple hours ago, at about 1:30 PM. Since then she has had some drainage but it is 95% better. Her Right Eye ball is still pink looking like as if she was hung over. The Left eyeball is white. Right Eye Weeping: She left work because her right eye was weeping so much, going into her nose, and she is running at work, she has glasses, goggles, face shield, and so she cant wipe the liquid. She came home and iced her eye which helped. Right Eye Pink: On Saturday the right eye was red. Right now it is pink, like an eye lash is in the eye. The right Eye being Red was only for Saturday, like sclerosis, it was red and swollen. The left eye was swollen, but it is better now from this morning. She was super congested on Friday (08Jan2021), barely being able to sleep, she couldn&#39;t breathe through the nose. Weird, she barely slept but it wasn&#39;t a sinus infection. She couldn&#39;t sleep because of nose running and the eye running then Saturday into Sunday she was able to sleep with eye running. The runny nose got better with the neti pot. She is schedule for the 2nd dose on 28Jan2021. The outcome of other events was unknown. Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

I went to the doctor again, they said it looked like inflammation of the iris. On 12/26 is saw an eye doctor that said it was episquaritis. I had a follow up appointment on 01/11 with the eye doctor he found out I have nodular degeneration. I had a follow up on 01/25 and was referred to a cornea specialists. This all started post vaccine. I have not history of eye problems.

There was pain initially. I am not sure if it is related as this did not occur until 1 week after I had the vaccine. However, I thought it was worth mentioning as the vaccine is so new.

                                                Immediately upon having the injection administered, my heart rate sped up. I sat down within the waiting area for monitoring thinking that if I sat down for a bit, that it would  maybe pass . Within about 7 minutes of  that, I began to feel the back, left side of my throat go numb. I began to get very dizzy after that and I alerted one the pharmacy Nurses, that was on duty. She asked for me to open  My mouth so that she could see if my throat was swelling &amp; said that she didn?t see anything and I was told by her that it may just be anxiety that I was experiencing and she asked me to take a few sips of water and to try and relax a bit. She resumed helping others, while I continued to sit there. It was then when I experienced a heavy onset of chest tightness and the inability to breathe. The left side of my face and jaw went numb &amp; that?s when I really knew something was wrong. I was taken outside for some fresh air and realize that I was so nauseous, more dizzy, very weak upon standing and I told the same nurse and another young lady that was assisting me that I felt like I was going to pass out and to please call EMS for me . At that time, I lost temporary feeling in all 4 limbs  and I began to experience heart  palpitations . I was having some trouble swallowing and I was laid down and. My blood pressure was taken. Blood Pressure was 235/130 and it was taken several times until emts arrived. It was then 200/120 and 180/112 by the time help arrived. Overall I experienced burning sensation in chest and abdomen, facial weakness and numbness left side fever loose stools weakness, shortness of brEath and chest tightness blurred vision felt like I?m out of touch with reality Malaise restless and the loss in feeling in my Limbs are slowly returning body And  muscle and joint aches and pains and wheezing bouts

At 2 PM she still had a headache and she lost most of the taste and smell; at 4 pm she was sick to her stomach; by 5:15, her arm and head hurt badly, the taste in her mouth was like super weird but it was not exactly metallic taste it was weird bizarre taste she never had before. Her smell came back. She was extremely nauseated and had a bad headache. She stated that all of her symptoms were gone away except the swelling in her throat. She further stated she called the hospital and stated she got injection site pain, headache, and muscle pain. She also got injection site swelling and redness, nausea, swollen lymph node and a headache and the weirdest part that really bothered her was the strange taste in her mouth. She got some of the smell and taste back and now it&#39;s gone; it&#39;s really bizarre like the injection site pain, the headache everything was gone literally gone. The only things that was still hanging on was her lymph nodes and throat. The second due dose of vaccine was on 14Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from swelling in her throat and swollen lymph node, and has recovered from other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Then, nausea and dizziness started, followed by burning and itching on both sides of tongue.  Then the back of the throat started hurting, and it became hard to swallow, followed by becoming very cold, chills, and dry mouth.  Finally the skin area around mouth and lips and up through the cheek/jawline became very itchy.       It was not anaphylaxis because my breathing was okay.  We drove home, and I took two Benedryl (50 mg) upon arriving home.  Within 2 hours all symptoms subsided with the exception of a nasty headache.  Today, I am fine, but just have a sore arm at the site.

                                                Her upper lip is a little swollen; Injection site soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot unknown, first dose) solution for injection intramuscular on 31Jan2021 at 08:43 (at the age of 47-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included seafood allergy (also happens when she gets seafood from, company name, it makes her lips puffy). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated everything was fine except for some injection site soreness on 31Jan2021 that lasted about two hours then completely resolved. On 01Feb2021, the patient stated this morning her upper lip is a little swollen (puffy). The puffiness as if a 2 year were to head butt you and it left your lip puffy. The patient stated last night for dinner she ate ham which was a different brand than usual and was wondering if it may have had some preservatives in it that could have caused the lip swelling and did not have any lip swelling before she went to bed at 10 pm last night. The outcome of the event lip swelling was unknown. The outcome of the event injection site soreness was recovered on 31Jan2021 after 2 hours.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                The entire left side of my body immediately felt mildly heavy and affected, but it was so minimal I thought it could be in my head. Throughout the evening after my shot I felt a bit of contracting of leg muscles and neck/shoulder muscles on the left side of my body. The left side of my face felt noticeably warmer than the right. This was all very mild, but just noticeable. In the middle of the night, I woke up with extreme night sweats but only on the left side of my body. The next morning (today) the left side of my face is still warmer but it feels droopy and bloated and slightly &#34;Numbish&#34;. My left eyelid feels heavy. My left cheeks feel swollen and puffy and my left gums and lips feel slightly numb. I also have a very mild headache only on the left side. This is disturbing, while it is not debilitating or painful, it is strange and makes me think I should not get the next shot. Even as I type this, my left hand feels very fatigued. I don&#39;t know who to call or talk to about this. I do not have a health care provider.

                                                Stomach upset; Mid back hurting; Metallic taste mouth; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6199), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Mar2021 at 07:58 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and ongoing allergies from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included lansoprazole (PREVACID) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease, start and stop date were not reported. The patient got her first dose of the vaccine yesterday (09Mar2021) and immediately when she was given the injection, she had a metallic taste in her mouth. This lasted 10-15 minutes. She added, she has allergies and she told them that when getting the vaccine. She was told to sit for 30 minutes. She actually sat for 45 minutes instead, but that went away. She later clarified she was referring to the metallic taste that went away. She also had nausea throughout the day. Last night, she took medicine for acid reflux because she has GERD and had stomach upset from the nausea. She clarified she took PEPCID. Then after that, she noticed her mid back was hurting. She is not sure if this is considered a muscle ache, did not really feel like a muscle ache, but it was like a burning type of pain. This was in her mid-back area. It would like to start on one side and rotate to the other and go back and forth. She sent an email to the doctor. She is the one who suggested she get the vaccine because at first, she was not going to get it. The doctor talked her into it. Metallic taste in mouth she did not have after leaving the area. It was a different taste. She was unable to clarify outcome. It was just something she noticed. Nausea: Commented she also take lansoprazole (PREVACID) every day. Last night, she took PEPCID. From what she can tell this morning she has not had nausea. However, she has not gone through the full day yet so would say it&#39;s still ongoing, but better. PEPCID (Lot: MHF063, Exp: Mar2021) at 20mg tablet, as needed, for stomach upset. She commented she does not know if she will take the second dose. Stomach upset seriousness criteria was confirmed as medically significant. It has gone away, but medically significant because she did not feel it until after the shot. Mid back hurting seriousness criteria was confirmed as medically significant as it is significant to her even though she is not currently getting treated for it. She still feels the ache. Yesterday, it was like a burning ache. Today it is just an ache on her right side, but still mid back. She does not know if it is a muscle ache. The outcome of the events was stomach upset was recovered on 10Mar2021, Mid back hurting and nausea was recovering, while of metallic taste mouth was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported events of stomach upset and back hurting due to temporal relationship.  Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided.

Then My right ankle swelled up.  My face and hands had hives on them.  My throat felt better, I thought but about 1/2 hr. Later I started wheezing and my right ankle and leg were swollen  so, I went to the urgacare.  They saw me but told me that I should&#39;ve gone to the ER. I have a history of anaphylaxis. They gave me steriods and Benadryl via shots and sent me home with the same.  I woke the next morning with a sore arm, a horrible headache and my face broke out into hives and was swollen again. Today is the 4th day after and my face still feels a little swollen, I have a headache and now an earache in my left ear.  Today I also felt nauseous and couldn&#39;t eat.

I did not get better. I felt even more on fire and my skin was hot to the touch. My tongue was really swollen and things get super fuzzy after the I might die feeling. Epi#2 Given around 5 minutes after Epipen 1. Medics took me to the ER and  more rescue meds were given. I was admitted to the nuero trauma floor for 24 hrs and given meds and iv fluids. I got out the next afternoon. By the next day I was back in urgent care. They gave me meds and sent me home. By 9pm that night I was using epi#3 and going back to the ambulance. I have been to urgent care 2 times since for continued issues. I have zero appetite and my whole GI system hates me. I am alive and breathing but still feeling the impact of all of this.

A 48-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, reason for no lot number: consumer stated, &#34;I can&#39;t even read, it says EK or E something 5730. That&#39;s what it looks like.&#34;), intramuscular in arm in Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included low thyroid, have had thyroid cancer many years ago.  Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID).  Consumer stated, &#34;I just have a question, I had a shot done on Wednesday and I have heard the second shot was worst so I was little concern we are all concerned about getting the first shot to begin with. So I had the shot on 11:30 at work at the hospital on Wednesday. I probably about 1:30 to 2 O&#39;clock in the morning total like flu side effect. I thought I got a flu, aches, pain, teeth chattering, shaking all night long and 102 fever. I haven&#39;t been sick at all thank god in a while but it feels like I had, so, I have a new born grandson supposed to go there for Christmas so I&#39;m concerned because I was running a 102 Wednesday night and I was so running a low grade so is it normal to have reaction like that?&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Yes, let me just get a pen. I just don&#39;t want to be around the baby. I thought I was fit but I don&#39;t usually when your body gets the vaccination your body fighting against the vaccine so I don&#39;t think it is going to affect the baby. I just don&#39;t want to get this shot if they got affected and if they are on fever. I just want to make sure before I go over there for Christmas.&#34;  When probed if calling for the first time in Pfizer drug safety department, consumer stated, &#34;No, actually I was just thinking now before I had out I grab these side effects yesterday and I read it I have fever 102, I was like let me call the number from the paper that they gave me with the shot card, let me call you guys and try to figure out what the hell is going on here and why I&#39;m so freaking sick from this shit.&#34; .Height and weight: Consumer stated, &#34;I say about 130 and about 5&#39;6.&#34;. LOT#: Consumer stated, &#34;Let me see if I have the card, I know I have it somewhere. May be I&#39;m just thinking I shouldn&#39;t get the second shot. I can&#39;t even read. it&#39;s Pfizer, I can&#39;t even read, it says EK or E something 5730. That&#39;s what it looks like.&#34;Manufacturer name: Consumer stated, &#34;Covid 19 Vaccine and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s Pfizer.&#34;.Lab work: Consumer stated, &#34;I had all my labs on like you know like regular labs CBC&#39;s like everything. I have bad thyroid it goes up and down, I didn&#39;t feel well so I went to you know I know when my thyroid is up or down so I went and got the whole blood panel done.&#34;.Date of administration of first dose: Consumer stated, &#34;It was probably like December 8th. I had it done on 23rd of December.&#34; (Not further clarified).Event date: Consumer stated, &#34;The same day I had the shot.&#34;.When probed if still experiencing the events, Consumer stated, &#34;Yes. It&#39;s not totally improved but it is better than it was but I still feel like very weak and achy.&#34; .Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;Tylenol and Ibuprofen I keep alternating it.&#34;Consumer stated, &#34;I just want to make sure I can go back to my grandson today because I went to my daughter last time she is leaving for (place name) tomorrow and she was nervous and now I&#39;m like still running a low grade fever last night and I know my daughter is going to flip out if I show up. I told her it&#39;s okay because it&#39;s only vaccination but I just want to make sure with the Covid shot I got.&#34; .The outcome of events I still feel like very weak and achy and pain/achy/aches was not recovered.

I had Lasik about a year ago and I called my eye Doctor because I was nervous and I went to see him and he told me it looked like a allergic reaction.  He put me on steroid drops. When I woke up Saturday morning my eye was fine, so I stopped taking the medicine.

                                                I waited 15 minutes and was fine. As I was driving to my work, my injection site began to hurt severely and I felt my throat swelling, it became increasingly difficult to swallow. My tongue felt larger and my lips and face began to feel numb. I felt flushed and I became tachycardic. It lasted about 45 seconds and then waned and then would flare again.  I was able to speak and called my husband (a physician) who stayed on the phone with me while I drove to the hospital. I went straight to an outpatient unit and was given hydrocortisone IV, loratidine PO and famotidine. By the time I was on the unit, my throat only felt slightly tight with tachycardia down to 103. Following the injection of steroids, I only had one further flare of throat tightness and tachycardia that was transient lasting 30-40 seconds. Everything resolved within 40 minutes of receiving therapy. Of note, I apparently had erythema on the anterior of my neck which corresponded to the area of throat tightness.

The patient stated that she is calling about the COVID Vaccine, she just had the shot at 7:50AM this morning. After getting the shot she heard that she is not suppose to get the shot if she had tested positive for COVID before the vaccine. She wanted to know if this was true or a rumor. Back around Nov2020 she did test positive for COVID. It was the week before the holidays on Wednesday 18Nov2020 when she lost taste and smell, she then got tested on 19Nov2020 Thursday then got results Friday or Saturday morning, the weekend before the holidays that she was positive. The test was a nasal swab. The girls in the office said she was not suppose to get the shot if it had not been 3 months. When she had COVID shot they didn&#39;t tell her if she could take it or not. This morning she woke up everything was fine, she drove over to get vaccine, after they put the vaccine in, they made her wait 15- 30 minute, while waiting she was getting a headache, then the headache went away and she then felt funny in the head. She was a little nauseous then that went away. Then she had this overwhelming feeling of tiredness like she could go to bed. She felt bad a little bit. When she then drove back to work at the school she had this funny taste in the mouth. Her boss wanted to call and see if this is all normal. The date of first dose was 13Jan2021, all the symptoms she experienced occurred within half hour of receiving the vaccine. She thinks she is fine. At the moment she does not have the taste in mouth any longer and her headache left. She still feels funny in head as well as she just feels bad inside, she has the feeling of overwhelming tiredness, she just feels like something is coming on, like she knows she is getting sick. She has no Lot or Expiry to share, she vaccine CDC card is outside in the car and not physically with her. Her drive to get the vaccine was an hour away to a Hospital and all the medication was taken an hour before. She went to the hospital to have the vaccine administered. Then she drove to work at a school. She has had an antibody test, in which they draw blood, it was negative but that was even before she caught COVID, it was back in Aug2020 or Sep2020. She has had no issues with vaccines in the past. The outcome of the event headache, a funny taste in the mouth, and nausea was recovered on 13Jan2021, tiredness/overwhelming feeling of tiredness was unknown, feeling &#34;funny&#34; in the head was not recovered. The events were assessed as non-serious.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I waited in the holding area (mass vax clinic) for 20 min.  No symptoms. The lights were very bad and bright flourescent so admittedly I was bothered by them or it could have been the beginning of the whooseyness  from the shot. My husband picked me up in the car out front, we were driving and I began to get pressure in my sinuses and mostly the sides of my nose. I did have some head congestion but this feeling had never happened (it should be noted I had negative covid tests to make sure stuffy head was nog covid related). Then I felt pressure in my ears and my face began to feel flush as my cheeks. All of this began at about 35 minutes after the injection. Then my lips began to feel strange. It was a cross between tingly and numb. I made as many faces in the car makeup mirror to make sure my face muscles were moving properly And they were. But there was definitely numbness occurring in my mouth. Tingly-numbness. This all happened within about 10 min of the first onset. Then I noticed some splotchiness on my lower arms. Mostly my left (shot was given in right- no redness at the injection site). I also got some splochiness on my chest and neck. Cheeks were also ruddy and flush. I did NOT have any problem breathing or swallowing at anytime. Nor did my pulse race (other than from a pit of panic from nerves over the reaction). I didnt have a thermometer but don?t think I had a fever either. We pulled over and I called a nurse on call. She told me if things worsened to go to hospital. I did have a little bit of the feeling you get when you are about to pass out and you feel like things are closing in a bit. But it never got past about a 2 on a scale of 1-10.  I decided I wanted something to eat (I HAD eatten before) and I went to get a sandwich. I still was a bit light headed but the symptoms did start to subside in about an hour. After that I was only tired and took a nap. Nothing else after those initial reactions.

                                                About 10 mins post vaccine my throat started to feel tight and almost numb.....then I was having difficulties swallowing, as if there was a lump in my throat......a few mins later my inner ears felt like they were burning and I felt pressure.  I asked staff if symptoms were a side effect of vaccine at 15 minute mark from waiting period.  They had me sit back down for another 15 mins and paramedic come see me.  I told him I felt fine other than my throat feeling like it was as getting tighter and the difficulty swallowing.  He offered to take my stats and I asked him to wait to see if symptoms would dissipate.  After approx 49 mins of waiting from initial shot dose, my heart felt like it was racing and my throat felt tighter and I was now having a much harder time swallowing and I felt lightheaded.   They took me back and hooked me up to get my vitals.  About 7 mins later they brought an EPI Pen and I administered the shot in my leg.  After approx 10mins &#43;/- I began to feel my throat loosening a little.  Then over the next 10 mins or so I felt almost normal with little trouble swallowing.  They told me that I needed to go to the ER for further Eval.  I arrived  at ER approx 15 mins later and they gave me 2 Benadryl and 2 steroid pills and monitored me for the next 4 hrs - I was released shortly after - and again no other pain or side effects after EPI Pen and meds they administered.   Sent home with EPI Pen and Steroids and instructions on what to watch for.

                                                It started out as an itchy area under the band aid. I took the band aid off and the itching got worse and went down my arm. A minute left after waiting 15 minutes I let the nurse know the reaction I was having ( bad itching), she looked at it and was red. She said it could be a site reaction and gave me an ice pack. Another nurse came to check on, and I told her I was really thirsty. By the time she got back my lips were feeling very heavy, lips itching and difficult to swallow, then my whole chest was covered in  a red rash. With in a couple minutes there was a paramedic there and was more difficult to swallow, they tried to give me Benadryl thru an IV and blew my vain. So he asked me for a IM shot of Benadryl, I said yes and took me to the ER. By the time got there the Benadryl  wore off and my lips got itchy and they took me right to the room and Dr gave me IV Solumedrol and Benadryl. They watched me for two hour sin the ER , they released me with 3 days of prednisone, Epipen, Benadryl. I went to the pharmacy  (15 minute drive from ER) and both my eyes starting swelling, so I took 50mg of Benadryl capsule and the next day I started the prednisone, I had to take Benadryl every 3 hours for the next couple days because my eyes would start swelling.

ER staff admitted me and began me on a IV steroid treatment accompanied with Pepcid and Benadryl After 2 hours in the ER under close observation my tongue was still swollen and my windpipe was in danger of being closed off so I was transported via ambulance to Hospital and admitted to Intensive Care Unit where they continued to administer steroids and Benadryl. By 2 a.m. my condition had not improved and I was given an EpiPen in my arm. The EpiPen did help but by 6 a.m. my tongue swelling had returned but not as severe. On march 24th The hospital then moved me from the ICU  to the cardiac wing to be placed on a heart monitor as they continue to administer steroids, Benadryl, and Pepcid. I was given another Epi Pen by 11 a.m.  in the cardiac  care unit due to my tongue beginning to severely swell again.  As of today, March 25th My tongue continues to swell and they still have me admitted to the hospital as they continue to observe me and continue to administer steroids and Benadryl all via my i.v. port. Today they are going to begin me on an oral Prednisone.

A 48-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: EN6199), via intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 11Mar2021 at 15:47 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing osteoarthritis, ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed about 15 years ago (2006) and ongoing anxiety diagnosed about 15 years ago (2006). The patient was very sensitive to medications even vitamins. The patient had a flu shot in Aug2020 (reported as Aug2021) and experienced chills that only lasted a day with the flu shot. The patient did not have any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. There was no illness at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included nabumetone (manufacturer unknown) 2 doses a day, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date, then on 11Mar2021 at 09:00 at 2 doses a day and then on 12Mar2021 at 18:30 at 2 doses a day. On 11Mar2021, blood work and urinalysis were taken and the patient assumes they were normal. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine last Thursday on 11Mar2021 at the pharmacy. She stated that this was the only thing that was new. On Thursday in the morning she was perfectly fine. Then she had lots of issues because of taking the vaccine. On 11Mar2021, shortly after she received the vaccine, within 14 minutes, her nose went numb, her upper lip went numb, she had shortness of breath, heart palpitations, panic attacks, severe anxiety, lightheaded / dizziness and the patient also experienced depression. Since the patient was very sensitive to medication and  vitamins, at first she thought it could have been another medication, Nabumetone, an anti-inflammatory, but her physician said that it was not that because it was out of her system before she received the COVID vaccine. The patient  said that she stopped the Nabumetone before the COVID injection. Her last dose before the vaccine was at 09:00 on Thursday (11Mar2021). She said that she usually takes 2 doses a day. She said that she took it again at 18:30 on 12Mar2021 Friday after the COVID injection. On 11Mar2021 at 17:00 she took alprazolam (XANAX) 1mg. She said that she ended up having a panic attack and could not breathe and stated that she thought she was dying. She kept coughing and her nose was numb. She took a Cetirizine (ZYRTEC) at 08:00 and it was not working fast enough so she took alprazolam 1mg at 08:15. She stated that she could not catch her breath and thought she was dying and she fell to the floor so her husband called the number. On 12Mar2021, Friday morning , she felt like she was dying. She was coughing and her nose was numb and she felt like she couldn&#39;t breath and she was pulling at her shirt and was lightheaded and dizzy. On 12Mar2021, Friday morning she was sent to the emergency room (ER) by ambulance because of the severe side effects. She had a hard time breathing. She contacted her physician via telehealth conference and was going to call them back to go in later this week. She said that she was still having anxiety. She was also still having shortness of breath, but it was more associated with anxiety now. She stated that because she had a panic attack she ended up hyperventilating and they thought her symptoms were from hyperventilating (which she has never experienced before). The patient inquired when the side effects will go away- referring to the heart palpitations, being on edge, and can&#39;t breathe.  She stated that she was not all there due to her anxiety. Her biggest concern was the anxiety, it was a shaky feeling with heart palpitations. The patient spoke to her doctors and the pharmacists and both of her doctors advised her not to get the second dose of the vaccine. She asked the pharmacist if she should take Diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and they told her no. On 15Mar2021, electrocardiogram (EKG) showed an abnormality and chest x-ray the patient assumes was clear. The outcome of events upper lip numbness was recovered on 12Mar2021 (Friday morning), nose numbness was recovered on 13Mar2021 (Saturday morning). The outcome of events heart palpitations, lightheaded / dizziness, severe anxiety, shaky feeling / being on edge, shortness of breath was not recovered. The outcome of event panic attacks, depression, hyperventilating, coughing, abnormal electrocardiogram and fall was unknown.

                                                The day after receiving the shot I developed pain in my entire arm from armpit to fingers. Pain became severe by day 3. Pain spread to my right breast, neck, back, and right scapular area. I have had numbness in my fingers on right side. Today is 16 days. The pain increased every day for about 10 days. Decreases slightly and is now holding.  I&#39;m am in terrible pain. I didn&#39;t sleep for 6 days when the pain was at is peak and still can barely sleep. It&#39;s the worst pain of my life. It feels like my arm is in fire and in a meat grinder. My arm and neck pain worsens when I use my arm or change positions. I am also getting flushed heat feelings on my face intermittently.  Since this vaccine I have had allergic reactions to ibuprophen and prednisone which sent me to the ER. Two medications I have received before with no problem. I also felt I was reacting to gargling with listerine which I have used before without issue.  I eat eggs regularly and got a small sensation of throat swelling with that too and have not eaten them again. My doctor is having trouble treating me since I am now having so many allergy symptoms to different things. I have been advised by my doctor not to continue with this vaccine or any vaccine in the future. I am still in terrible pain that is limiting me from participating i. my normal life activities.  I did not develop any rashes or obvious swelling at the injection site. Twenty minutes after receiving the shot I did get a bit flush feeling and some redness in my face and my ears felt hot and then cold. That resolved within about 45 minutes.

On 04/09/2021 came back for second round. The nurse gave me my 2nd shot and said they don?t make patients wait after injections, I left the facility and by the time I reached my car my tongue had swollen up, went home and later that night my husband and kids asked what was wrong with my eyes - both my eyes were bloodshot red and swollen. On 4/10, my left eye was better but not my right. I have had brain fog, not being able to remember short memories all weekend. I plan to call my doctor in the morning.  As a woman, I felt morally obligated to share my side effects.

                                                About 3 weeks after my first dosis of the Pfizer vaccine, I started having constant numbness in both arms, hands and right legs, dizziness, pins and needles, extreme fatigue, lethargy, feeling the pulse of my heart rate in various part so my body in an opressive kind of way like in my throat, under my right breast, in my back on the ribs usually. All these symptoms never subsided and became noticeably worse a few days after my second dosis on April 8th.  My arms are always numb when I get up and become worse when hanging down, of course, but with different intensity.  I am feeling extremely dizzy as I walk around and unstable. Walking feels like the ground is further than it is in a way. I do notice a slight shortness of breath but more of an oppression in the rib cage than panting. I have been avoiding walking far or walking my dogs all together. I am not seeing any improvements even after my visit to the Urgency Care where nothing wrong was found on blood work and EKG. I was told to reduce inflammation with dietary supplement and some vitamins. I cannot work of course and what is a bit frightening now is that I am not improving on day 8 of my second dosis! Same rotation of weird symptoms all day (feeling my blood not circulating normally if that can be described even, numbness, pins and needles in arms, and right leg. Sometimes it affects my right cheek. Dizziness and unstability to walk around. Vision is lower as well. Too weak to do anything constructive.    My legs feel like they are not reliable (never have had that feeling at my age). It is more than feeling like a zombie, it is feeling too weak to do anything and my head is sometimes spinning. The numbness can be painful as a sudden thrust in an arm ( this does not last more than a few seconds).  It has now been going on since week 3 of my first dosis and today is day 7 of my second dosis! I had 0 symptoms on the first 2 weeks of my vaccine, dosis one. Now, I don&#39;t see any progress, rather a slight worsening of all the symptoms above. It is freakish not knowing what I have, of course. One can imagine, so stress adds to the mix sometimes during the day. I would not dare to even go walk my dogs now. A short grocery store visit at the most.

The blisters on her lips were white places like a canker sore but it was not a canker sore. Her lip was split like mouth ulcers. She took Benadryl and it helped.

Left hand rash, of the webbing between the thumb and forefinger, raised. Not as severe as the wrist. Numbness or tingling of the lips, intermittent, first occurred an hour after the vaccine and has been infrequent since then. Gradually reducing in frequency; described as an awkward sensation of tingling.  Has contacted her PCP for an appointment. Local Pharmacy would not sell or recommend medications due to the patient&#39;s history of Pfizer vaccine without her having been diagnosed first.

The 49-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history.  Patient got first dose of the COVID vaccine and experienced her lips tingled/ tingling of the lips and her throat got tight, both on 21Dec2020, led to medically significant, lasted about 20 minutes. They observed her and she did not need any further treatment. Outcome of events was recovered in 21Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of her lips tingled/ tingling of the lips and her throat got tight cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event (anaphylactic adverse reaction) profile of the suspect product.

Twice while I drove back to work and twice while I was working. These episodes were brief. I also experienced numbness and tingling in my arm that received the injection. This feeling spread to my shoulder and traveled up my neck to my face. I had numbness and tingling on my left side of my face and lower lip. This lasted  till about 3:30 pm and then went away.  Tonight around 7:00 pm I am still experiencing some numbness and tingling on my face and lip which comes and goes. I am having soreness in my arm at the injection site.

A 49-Year-Old Female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899, expiration date: Mar2021) on the 21Dec2020 on deltoid left at single dose to prevent COVID 19. Medical history included Hypertension and Rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications included losartan for Hypertension and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (PLAQUENIL) for Rheumatoid arthritis. She was experiencing a few side effects that are on the list. However, the one that is not on there and she have never had them before. She think that it is something with her left eye there is some puffiness and there is a little bit of swelling and there is a sensation to touch like a little bit of pain when you touch it. It actually started yesterday (22Dec2020) and she took the vaccine two days ago (21Dec2020) and it is on the same side as her injection. So it is on her left side on her left eye and the injection was given on her left Deltoid. It seems to be getting a little better now though the sensation by touch is not as much as it was this morning or yesterday. So she think like it is like going away but it is just something that she think may be should be looked at as one of the possible side effect. She did get neck pain, headache, and bit of headache. She think she was a little bit feverish and nausea and joint pain and a lot of fatigue. She had a harsh soreness around her both temples and her face was like when smile or laugh it was sore. Patient took Ibuprofen to help with the soreness and the pain. It was 800mg. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I did have a hematoma and bruising, No fever On Jan 1st, I started feeling fatigued again and noticed round reddening approximately 2 inch in diameter appear about a inch under vaccination location which is still bruised.  There is no pain or itching at reddened site. Jan 2, 3 and 4th-Fatigue worsened and developed low grade temp never surpassing 100. My throat developed allergy reaction feeling, same reaction I get with nuts.  Throat did not swell and benedryl managed the reaction on Jan 3rd.  My eyes began swelling and I could not stop sneezing.  Developed laryngitis from the post nasal drainage.   I was up whole night but still went into work as normal on Jan 4th.  Struggled through the days but swelling and itching subsided.    I experienced the muscle aches on the 3rd and 4th. On Jan 5th, started feeling better and rested.  Still have reddened reaction on arm but is fading.  It is faintly visible today on Jan 6th, I feel better, just have the sneezing currently and a mild headache.  Benedryl is the only medication besides daily meds I took during the past several days.  I did not want to interrupt the immune system&#39;s work.

                                                throat swelling; Initially had headache; dizziness; irritability; Throat tingling; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received a single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EJ1685) as the first dose via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Dec2020 06:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia, asthma, prediabetes, and carpal tunnel syndrome. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were not any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient had no previous allergies to vaccines. The patient allergies to medications which included: doxycycline, medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA), metoclopramide (REGLAN), gluten. The patient initially had headache, dizziness and irritability, throat tingling, throat swelling, and difficulty swallowing started around 12 hours after injection, event onset date reported as 29Dec2020 18:00. The events resulted in emergency room/ department or urgent care. The events were reported as non-serious by HCP. Treatment received for the events included diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine embonate (HYDROXYZINE PAMOATE). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pharyngeal swelling together with other symptoms was likely related to the single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                29 minutes after vaccine was given i felt tingling and numbness on my left cheek and left side of my lips. i informed nurse and she began taking blood pressure and oxygen levels while asking if i was breathing ok.  i said yes. i then felt the right side of my lips go numb.  i felt a faint tightness in my throat but after about two minutes it felt like my right side of the lips started to feel normal and my throat.  then all at once i felt the blood rush from my body and tingling all over. i told the nurse i didnt feel good. she layed me down on the floor and put my feet up. she asked what i was feeling and i said i felt like i was going to faint.  i was aware that my tongue felt heavy and i wasn&#39;t talking clear. another nurse got the allergist or doctor on standby and she asked me what i was feeling. i just rubbed my throat and my cheeks and lips and felt numbness and my throat tight and my tongue very thick. she asked if i was having a hard time swallowing. i nodded so she said they were going to sit me up because they needed to give me an Epipen. i nodded, tgey brought a wheekchair for me and as they helped me stand because i had no strength, a nurse stabbed me with the Epipen then they took me to the emergency room and observed me until 2:30pmish to make sure i didnt have another episode. then i wss discharged and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor within 3 days. An  allergist will also see me to do a skin test.

                                                The night I had the Covid vaccine, ~ 12 hrs later, I had a sudden onset of intense itching in my right ear, that extended deep into region of Eustachian tube. This lasted ~ 1 hr  and finally subsided just before I was getting ready to take a Benadryl.  The itching returned intermittently over the next 3 weeks, and was bothersome. This was accompanied by the feeling of warmth about the ear occasionally. One incidence of tiny pains in the ear occurred.  After ~ 18 days, a gradual onset of ringing in the ears began. This worsened on day 19 , becoming twice as loud.  At this point , I deferred the second vaccine dose which was scheduled for day 19, 1/22/21.

                                                I received my second Pfizer covid vaccine at 4:00 p.m. on 1/14/2021 from a co-worker.  At 2:30 a.m. on 1/15/2021 I woke up with severe rigors that lasted 2 hours.  Over the course of the day 1/15/2021 I had a second 2 hour episode of rigors. They were almost violent and seizure-like.  In addition, I had severe nausea, dizziness, decreased vision, fever, myalgia, and exhaustion.  My temperature reached 103.4 and lasted over 24 hours.  Ibuprofen would bring the fever down 1 degree and helped decrease rigors, but did not help the headache.  On 1/16/2021 I developed redness and swelling of entire upper left arm, and edema in arm pit.  I spent three days unable to work or sit up in a chair. Symptoms began to decrease after three days, but I was unable to resume full work days until 1/22/2021.  Vision returned to 100%, and nausea resolved, on 1/23/2021.  Decreased appetite and fatigue are still an issue as of 1/25/2021.

                                                At night on the day of the vaccine I started with a headache, a dull headache, nothing sharp, really tired and my body was achy. My left arm was sore.  The next day roughly the same symptoms throughout the day, really tired and just kinda achy. On a Holiday after I had the vaccine, when I took the ibuprofen, my husband realized he lost his sense f taste and smell and he realized he was the same way the day before. He got tested Saturday the day after the Holiday and since I was still achy on Saturday I called employee health and they told me to get tested. I was tested through Employee Health ( employee only testing site). I still get tired really quick, I get winded really quickly even after doing chores at the house, like laundry and even if I am sitting still, I still sometimes am short of breath. The dull headaches are still present. I had lost my sense of taste and smell but those came back.

A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration at arm on 15Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated that she just wanted to report what she thinks is adverse reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer not sure what to do about it at this point. She was vaccinated Friday 11 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. Both days felt really fine. Last night (16Jan2021) got some fullness under her armpit which was on the same side as the vaccine, which looked like swollen lymph nodes under her armpit which you can see was kind of benign. But in addition to that some generalized malaise lowgrade and headache (Jan2021). Seems totally fine but her both eyes are very swollen (Jan2021). Nurse took some ibuprofen (ADVIL)-600 mg, she was taking Prednisone for inflammatory prosthesis in her eye as treatment (Jan2021). Outcome of the events was unknown.   The nurse considered the occurrence of the events are because of COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Swollen eyes and Eye inflammation cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 3am the next morning I woke up to a loud ringing in both my ear.  When I sat up I was very very dizzy.  I got up and showered and my feet swelled very bad.  I did not feel well but I went to work but the feelings never got better.  So on 1/10 Sunday I went to the medical center because I jjust didnt not feel well.  The swelling in the lower legs was still there so I was prescribed 20 mg of presnisone for 5 days.  The sound changed during the time of the antibotics but after I stopped taking the prednisone the ringing sound came back, my left foot is still numb and my eyes are constantly red and burning even after putting drops in my eyes, I still suffer from headaches and if I turn my head too far left or right I get dizzy still to date.  On 1/14 I was given a 60 mg dose of tapered predinosone for 2 week to help elevate the symptoms but it did not work.  On 2/12 I saw an ENT specialist who performed a hearing test which did produce minor hearing loss and was diagnosed with having Tinnitis.

That was it until later that night I started getting a really bad headache/migraine.  I started taking Tylenol but that didn&#39;t help much.  I got chills and I&#39;m sure a slight fever because I was sweating.   I started throwing up also..  After taking Tylenol every 4 hours my headache finally went away and I started to feel better.   This was around 2:30 pm the following day.  I would say my symptoms lasted for about 22 to 24 hours.

I was wearing a thick hoodie and when I pulled  my sleeve up, it was covered with hives and welts. My lower lip started to feel full and nose started to feel runny. I was close to a pharmacy when I discovered the hives so I went and bought Tylenol and Benadryl and took it immediately. After that, I headed to the emergency room of the facility where I got my covid 19 -Pfizer injection. When I got there, my right arm started to feel itchy as well and I also broke out in a rash on my left upper chest. They gave me a steroid injection and steroid taper prescription.  When I got home that night, my right forearm broke out in hives. The next couple of days, my left arm intermittently had hives.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

                                                Delayed Localized allergic reaction.  Approximately 24 hours after shot, I developed hives and swelling on cheeks, chin and swelling of lips.  Immediately took 25mg of Benadryl.   Sought treatment at an UTC for evaluation.   I did not have trouble breathing and oxygen saturation was good, always above 97%.  Upon reaching clinic 1 hour later, swelling and redness had gone down.  Doctor diagnosed it as a localized allergic reaction to vaccine.  I was given another 25mg of Benadryl and prescribed prednisone 20mg for 3 days.   Swelling and redness has been intermittent since yesterday.   All swelling and hives are confined to the face.  I have been taking 50mg pf Benadry every 6-8 hours continuing this evening.  It should be noted that I pre medicated with Benadryl the 2 nights before vaccination, the morning of, 1 hour after the shot and late evening the day I received the vaccine.  I knew with my history of allergies I was at higher risk of allergic reaction.   Please note the facial, eye and lip swelling began the following morning,  12 hours AFTER my last dose of Benadryl.

Next 2 days the injection site became red, swollen (knot under skin) and grew in size to a silver dollar. My left arm was sore.  Redness and swelling dissipated on 4th day and looked like a bruise.  About 6pm on 4th day, I was itchy on my stomach. I didn&#39;t think twice as had a neoprene/spandex brace around stomach/back from exercise. When I finally took a shower at 8pm, I noticed my torso was completely red.  I immediately took 2 Benadryl. Throughout the evening the rash/hives spread to my shoulders. Took 2 more Benadryl at 1am. By morning rash around torso  was almost gone, but some spread slightly to wrists, shoulders, breasts and knees. Took 2 more Benadryl at 8 am. Applied Benadryl cream to few spots on body throughout today. Itching mostly gone but splotches on legs, neck and few on back. Will take more Benadryl about 6pm.

                                                The day after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine, I had a massive headache, to the point where I stayed in bed and slept all day.   I also noticed that my brain was foggy.  The next day I was able to move to the couch, but the headache was still severe with continued brain fog.  I called by PCP to see if there was anything that I needed to be doing or taking and she told me that I should start feeling better the next week.   The headache remains but is mild.  I have memory loss and difficulty concentrating.  I am a nurse and over my weekend at work, I had difficulty doing my job because I couldn&#39;t keep track of what I was supposed to be doing and had difficulty charting.  My coworkers even commented that I seemed &#34;really different&#34;, that my memory was poor, I had personality changes (according to one person) and that my standard of care was much less than usual.  One person also commented that seemed to not be able to hear her and kept asking her to repeat herself.  I find myself having to concentrate harder to see when I am reading or typing something.  I missed work on January 14 and 15 because of the mental fogginess and headache.  I thought I was doing better, but I realized that I wasn&#39;t when I returned to work on January 23 and 24.  I have spoken to my PCP on the phone once and am awaiting calls from my PCP and neurologist regarding this event.

Peripheral IV established labs obtained. I do have concern for adverse reaction secondary to the vaccine as her symptoms started she said shortly before an hour after receiving the vaccine is started with tingling in her tongue throat and her body. She has minimal cardiac risk factors. Given she was tachycardic she cannot be perked out. EKG obtained showed no acute ischemic ST elevation or depression. Initial troponin was not elevated. Patient received 500 mL bolus of normal saline she deceived Benadryl and part of Pepcid. While the Benadryl infusion was going on patient reported feeling lightheaded and her heart rate was noted to increase to the 130s briefly. The medications were stopped, the Benadryl had already finished however the Pepcid was not completed. Her heart rate proved quickly and the lightheadedness resolved. Repeat EKG obtained did show some mild ST depression inferiorly. A repeat troponin obtained at 2 hours remain negative D-dimer was elevated to 91 therefore CTA chest was obtained. This showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism there is small groundglass opacity left upper lobe which is likely related to atelectasis do not feel that this is infectious in etiology patient has not had cough fever or chills. She remained on cardiac monitor here without any further tachycardia and her symptoms had resolved. I do believe patient&#39;s presentation is secondary to adverse reaction to the vaccination. She was advised to take Benadryl at home and may also try over-the-counter Pepcid at home for her symptoms. Did not feel that steroids were warranted at this time. She is to follow-up closely with her primary care provider. I did advise if she has new or worsening symptoms she should return to the emergency department and she expressed understanding and agreement with this plan.

When I got to my car, my face felt very hot and was flushed and the right side of my tongue felt thick for a day or more.  Yesterday was one week ago from my vaccine and my tongue intermittently still feels thick.  My tongue  feels like it does when novocaine starts to wears off from the dentist.  My right arm also felt sore and puffy; however, there was no skin reaction.  The next day or so the right side of my neck was sore.  As to be expected, my arm was also sore.

She said the nurse suggested she talk to a medic located in the back are of where the COVID-19 Vaccines were being administered. She said she talked to medic. She said at that point it was probably about 25 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she never had allergies, and had no problem with the flu vaccine. She said she has had issues with anesthesia in the past, and if she is given the wrong type of anesthesia, she can get nauseous. She said the medic took her heart rate, and her heart rate was 154-ish. She said her heart rate was high, but sometimes for her, that is the case. She said the medic asked her how her breathing was. She said her breathing was OK, and could swallow fine. She said when the medic rechecked her heart rate, her heart rate was still the same.

She said her symptoms didn&#39;t seem like a panic attack because she wasn&#39;t having difficulty breathing and she wasn&#39;t short of breath, but she was somewhat nervous. She said she was not sure what to do, so she contacted her family doctor to see what she should do when she goes for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said the Urgent Care doctor gave her a prescription for Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25mg capsule, 1 capsule three times daily, as needed, for anxiety. She said her doctor told her the Hydroxyzine Pamoate is used for allergic reactions, as well. She clarified when she was at the urgent care her heart rate went down, and the nurse at the urgent care gave her 2 Benadryl pink capsules. Reported she took Benadryl when she got home because she was afraid she was having an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. Outcome of possible allergic reaction was unknown. She said she had a great night sleep, and the next morning took her first dose of the Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25mg. She said her primary care doctor suggested she take the Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25mg an hour before she gets the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose.

                                                Within approximately 56  hours from 1st injection, I got an intense left eye pain.  Went to the ER where they flushed it, numbed it, and prescribed drops for conjunctivitis.  I had no symptoms prior.  Completed treatment and seemed fine.    Within 13 hours of second dose (3/3/21 @ 2:00 pm), I woke up with eye pain in the left eye and used part of the remaining drops; thankfully did not get as bad as the first one, so far.

I got sick with the first one from about 4ish hours after until the next mid morning maybe?  Then I felt bad again that second night.  I had my vaccine (second) yesterday at 4 PM, and I felt OK going to bed but had a pretty pitiful night.  I woke up at 5 AM and I felt horrible.  That felt like someone took a pair of metal cymbals and slammed them together on my head.  The tinnitus was strong.  I also had body aches and joint pain and felt like I had the flu.  I felt a little better around 1 PM, but felt bad again around 330.  Now I&#39;m miserable again with terrible body aches and chills (this was at 7:38 PM).  I&#39;m sure I will feel better in the morning, just wanted to share my experience.&#34;  Sadly, since then, I have had tinnitus with a metallic ringing in both ears along with hearing loss.  I had some vertigo one day but unsure if this was related.  The tinnitus makes me very sad.  I am a hospitalist and am happy to have been vaccinated, still.  It has been 2 months today, and it remains, unrelenting.  It is worse in the morning and at night.  The hearing loss is difficult.

                                                severe tinnitus/tinnitus was reported as worsened; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper arm on 19Mar2021 (batch/lot number: EN6207; expiration date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing arthritis, ongoing intermittent tinnitus - she has a history of noise exposure and intermittent tinnitus in the past but was certainly unremarkable, she shrunk before the vaccine - she was five seven her whole life and then thinks she was only five six. Family history included hearing loss in her mother, grandmother, and uncle but that was with advanced age. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 first dose on 26Feb2021 via injection in her left upper arm (lot number: E and then either I or 1 9266; expiration date unknown) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced severe tinnitus on Mar2021, tinnitus was reported as worsened. She received the second dose of the Covid vaccine on 19Mar2021 and reported a day or two later, she started experiencing tinnitus. She stated that she has been on and off steroids for the tinnitus. She asked if there has been a correlation identified between the vaccine and tinnitus. She asked was this a side effect of the vaccine. She was asking for any information such as studies, articles, awareness and frequency, regarding tinnitus being experienced after the vaccine. She was calling about the COVID 19 vaccine. She stated she was formally a retired audiologist she was calling because she was wondering what information Pfizer has about the onset of tinnitus. She stated after the second vaccine, she has developed significant tinnitus and as an audiologist she has trained people about tinnitus. She asked was this a symptom of the vaccine. She stated she knows tinnitus was a side effect of the COVID virus but was unsure if it was a side effect of the vaccine. She stated as a matter of fact she went to the national adverse reaction to report her reaction but not the particular Pfizer website. She stated she turns 51 next week and was currently 50. She stated she was five six as she has shrunk. She clarified she shrunk before the vaccine and stated she was five seven her whole life and then thinks she was only five six. She stated her doctor does not know she has this side effect. She stated she was going to see an ear nose throat friend but she was waiting. Severe tinnitus: She stated this started between 1 and 2 days after she received the vaccine which was on 19Mar2021 so either 20Mar2021 or 21Mar2021. She stated it may have got worse she had taken a short round of steroids and the tinnitus got better after the first two days and then the tinnitus returned and had no response to the steroids and she has done this twice. She stated the first two days of steroid usage she feels relief then the tinnitus comes back and she said to heck with it and stopped the steroid. She stated the tinnitus was a constant bilateral high frequency pure tone just very high pitch. She stated this was medically significant because it was a significant finding but not life-threatening. First dose was an injection in her left upper arm and received on 26Feb2021 unknown NDC number and expiry date. She stated the lot number was E and then either I or 1 9266. She stated it was actually not her turn in to get the vaccine but School System had extra doses and opened it up to anyone and everyone not just 1A or 1B. She stated she was 50 with no medical significant comorbidities other than arthritis and since the vaccine was opened up to the general public she was also eligible to get the second dose. She stated she believes the COVID 19 vaccine was related to the severe tinnitus because the onset was immediate and she has had tinnitus from other noise exposure but this was very different and not intermittent and does not come and go it was a different pitch too. She stated there has been no changes, no medication changes so everything else remained steady almost immediately after the vaccine her ears started ringing and she sort of ignored it and her ears were screaming loud a significant very loud even in the presence of background noise just a constant high pitch noise. She stated the tinnitus was impacted only 2 days from the steroids and then no impact after. She stated she considered taking a third dose and was still doing experiments. She stated was this something Pfizer was aware of and was there any information about monitoring people. She stated she knows there has not been a vaccine for that long and there may not be long term resolution but she wanted to report and ask what information Pfizer may already have. She stated the first steroid she started approximately 9 days after the onset and she had Medrol left over from her knee. She clarified the name as Medrol dose packs. She stated she thinks it was a 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Medrol dose pack that she had left over and she was able to set a series of 4, 3, 2, 2, and 1 but she threw packaging away and it was not a current medication as it was dated a couple years ago but she figured she would see if it would work and the first couple days it did but then not so much. Medrol dose packs unknown manufacturer, NDC number, lot number, expiry date. She stated moving forward her husband was a doctor and wrote Prednisone 10 mg and she was supposed to take 30 mg twice a day for 10 days and she took 30 mg once a day since she did not read the bottle and so she took 30 mg once a day for 5 days. She stated the same thing happened the first two days resolved and then nothing. Prednisone unknown manufacturer, NDC number, lot number, expiry date. She stated so she was actually considering taking 60 mg for 10 days and try to hit the tinnitus to see if she has an impact. She stated her concern/whole point to take the vaccine was to get antibodies and the body can recognize it but now a week and 2 weeks out she has taken a steroid which was suppressing her immune system and what does that do to the immune system. She stated the tinnitus was significant and she does not have a quiet moment and it was a cruel injustice as she used to train people and spent hours and hours counseling and now she was experiencing it. She stated it was significant enough to call and see if there was anything Pfizer knows more. She stated the first dose was given at 12:30 to 13:00 and the second dose was around 11:45 to 12:00. The adverse event did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

Today, feels normal. Pt denies hx of allergies but her mother has a hx of anaphylaxis with IV contrast. EE denies throat tightness, SOB, wheezing. Numbness on left leg.  Advised EE to go to ER if she experiences throat tightness and itchyness, SOB, or wheezing. Advised pt that she should consult her PCP to decide whether or not the benefits of recieving the second dose of the vaccine outweigh the risks and if she should pre-medicate with benadryl for the second dose if she choses to recieve it. &#34;

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received the vaccine on Monday at 4:30, around 5:30 I noticed my tongue feeling weird, no difficulty swallowing, no resp issue and no rash. I took 25 of Benadryl and went about my evening. Tuesday around 12:00 I had that same sensation but a little stronger, I would call it a tongue swelling but no resp issues or swallowing problems. I called my PCP and he recommended me to take Zyrtec (which I take 1 daily) BID and Benadryl prn. I took 3 doses of Benadryl Tuesday and a Zyrtec Tuesday night and one Wednesday and  around 8:15 had the same sensation, tongue swelling but milder. I immediately took 50 mg of Benadryl and called my Dr again and he recommended a steroid pack and Benadryl prn and to not take the 2nd dose.

                                                Got my second dose of Pfizer, 12 hrs later developed  fever (103 F), chills, myalgia, headache. Fatigue, bilateral orbital pain. No visual problems. Took Tylenol every 4 hrs and fever (101. 5)returns in 1-2 hrs. Pulse ox remained normal, 98%, but pulse was 99/min. Usually my resting pulse ox is 55/minutes.  Was unable to go to work and see patients.  Had these symptoms for 48 hrs even though stayed in bed, took Tylenol around the clock and drank plenty of fluids (2-3 liters of water in addition to natural orange and apple juices). Never lost appetite either, do eating my vegetables and fish diet. Ice cream help between Tylenol?s. Completely resolved after 72 hrs. Now still have  LEFT  injection site tender deltoid and left axillary tender nodes, improving as well. All along breathing fine, no cough or congestion or sore throat. No anosmia  or dysgeusia.  This was after my second Pfizer dose.  After the First dose only had tenderness on the RIGHT deltoid muscle injection site and tender axillary node, resolved by now.

Started having symptoms a couple of hours after 2 dose of vaccine. Feels like nerves are burning in these areas. Intense headache 24 hrs after shot. Took Tylenol 500 mg with no relief. Took naproxen 550 mg Tuesday night around 10 pm. Resolved headache but not burning sensation around mucus membranes. Got progressively worse. Saw MD on Friday who did pelvic exam. Confirmed vaginitis. Prescribed Medrol dosepak, refresh vaginal lubricant and topical desitin. Currently on day 4 on Medrol dospak with some relief. Burning sensation now comes and goes and is not constant. Again, the burning sensation feels like the nerves in the areas of mucus membranes are inflamed.

I was feeling fine. The next day I lost my sense of smell. Talked to my PCP and he told me to get tested for COVID, to my surprise I was positive. That was on the 28 or 29 of December. I also developed a lump on my neck on the right side and my PCP prescribed a Z Pack. I finished it but it never went away. I developed another lump on my left side when I took the second dose and I am taking Doxycicline for it.

Was given Benadryl and Steiroid. chest x ray given which was normal. EKG taken which was abnormal but told was consistent with an older EKG. Was feeling better and about 90 minutes later felt warmth over my heart, my lips and mouth became tingly and both arms went numb and uncertain if my heart monitor showed abnormal. Was admitted overnight for observation. About 10 hours later had warmth in my chest, heart started beating fast, numbness in arms and around mouth and slight tightness in throat. Benadryl administered and heart calmed after couple of minutes, numbness went away after couple of minutes and tightness in throat went away after an hour.  Again about 13 hours later the warmth in chest and heart racing only symptoms. Given another dose of Benadryl. The symptoms only lasted a couple of minutes.  I also saw a cardiologist who ordered an echocardiogram just to rule out anything with my heart. It was normal.  I was sent home with instructions to use Bendryl oral for 3 days every 12 hours. I was told it could be from vaccine and I was to follow symptoms for 2 weeks and if not better to see cardiologist to look at other reasons.   I have taken the Benadryl for 3 days every 12 hours and did not have any other episodes with my heart.  I am on day 6 now and I have joint pain and headache.

A 51-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:00 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient was working in healthcare and around Covid positive patients daily.  There were no concomitant medications. 10 minutes after getting bnt162b2, patient noticed side effects. Patient had a metallic taste in throat and a few more things. Right after getting it she had a flushed feeling in her body and legs, similar like IV contrast. 10 minutes after that so about 20 minutes later she had mid chest tightness and weakness that was gone after about 40 minutes to an hour. Patient was unable to provide any seriousness criteria, stating it was scary for a moment and she didn&#39;t know what it was, but the mid chest tightness could have progressed to something more serious. That was how she felt at that moment, but after it was all gone, it was not serious. She did not know why or what the reason was or if she was lucky or what. Patient was sitting for 10 minutes after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine and was doing something on her phone when she started experiencing these symptoms unexpectantly. Eventually the nurses observing her after a half hour took her to the emergency room since she wasn&#39;t feeling any better. Patient had emergency room visit for all events. Outcome of events was resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported mid chest tightness and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the plausible temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                After the first dose for the Pfizer, I experienced a metal like taste in mouth, shortly after. However, that went away within an hour. I had the typical low side effects of localized injection soreness, swelling, redness, warmth feeling and it was red around the injection site. The following two days after vaccination (2/22/21) I experienced the expected low side effects. On the third day after vaccination, I was feeling well again.   However, yesterday 3/2/21, I noticed the area where I received the Covid vaccine was red again, with itching, warmth feeling, redness, and a bit of burning sensation. This is only apparent on the injection site. I contacted the CDC today, 3/3/21 and they directed me to you to report this and also to contact my healthcare provider, which I have. The CDC was not able to tell me if it was considered normal to have the localized injection site side effects resurface again a week after receiving the 1st dose vaccine.   Therefore, I was advised by the CDC to report it. It is also unclear to me if the reason for the localized injection site side-effects being more prominent because of where the injection was administered. There is a question about it having been administered closer to subcutaneously by the nurse than intramuscular, but I do not know.

She is still be worked up for the headaches.

Three days after that, a bilateral higher frequency buzzing tinnitus (that presents over the head rather than in the ear) appeared. Prior existing tinnitus levels were previously unnoticeable throughout the day (able to successfully ignore and forget about) but now  both are noticeable throughout the day and take quite a bit of effort to distract myself from.

I continued to close up my desk to leave work for the day thinking it would just go away in few minutes. When I got to my vehicle I took two Benadryl capsules and drank a bottle of water and waited nearby the hospital emergency department parking area for 30 - 40 minutes. The numbness had eased and I drove home.  Tuesday and today (Wednesday) I have felt very tired and fatigued.

Waves of nausea and headache continued into the next day. I had not had a migraine in over 2 years prior to this event. Treated with OTC Excedrin at first on Jan 10th, then when that was ineffective took butabital at lunch time and when that was ineffective took Maxalt with phenergan about 5p. The next day on Jan 11th, thought I was better but by 630a nausea returned in waves and headache began building again. Took Maxalt with phenergan about 930a and again at 9p.

                                                I had a mild headache the evening of the shot, I had a headache the next two days that was relieved by Advil. I had a very sore arm at the injection site Friday and Saturday after the shot was given. The arm pain was gone Sunday morning.  I was very tired on Saturday especially and slept through the morning and early afternoon on and off until about 3:00 pm. On Friday during the day, I noticed my right ear starting to feel unusual and uncomfortable.  On Saturday, the ear issue continued, I felt like I had some hearing loss and a constant buzzing and ear fullness feeling.  On Sunday, the ear issued continued with the hearing loss, buzzing and fullness and has through today and hasn&#39;t stopped.  I tried some nasal decongestant on Sunday afternoon, but it didn&#39;t have any effect.  I made an appointment with the ENT doctor on Monday morning for Tuesday.  I had a hearing test on Tuesday and saw the ENT doctor on Wednesday.  He prescribed prednisone and ordered an MRI.  I will be starting the prednisone later today (Wednesday) when the pharmacy has the prescription ready.

I felt pain in my temple and I also felt like my ears were clogged.  My tonugue was tingling and I had pain across my chest.   I had trouble swallowing and taking a deep breath.  The medical providers assessed me and since my heart was not racing and I did not have a rash all over my body, deemed I was okay.  When I went home, I noticed a rash on my chest from my collarbone to my sternum and alongside my ears on my neck.  My sister is an ER Doctor and I did a video conference with her. She had me take Benadryl.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccine nor have I ever had to take Benadryl.

When I woke up the next morning I was extremely dizzy and fell in the shower.  It was more than just being dizzy it was like I couldn&#39;t see and it was hard to pick myself up.  I may have fainted because I didn&#39;t recall falling just noticed I was on the shower floor.  I thought I had gotten up but then again I was still on the floor.  I made it back to bed and slept for a few hours.  After that I seemed fine.

I had a burning sensation in the inner left ear canal as well as the left lower lid. Spoke with Dr and was placed on Prednisone 60mg po daily x 10 days with a taper and Valacyclovir 1gm po bid x 10 days.  The degree of parenthesis as of 1-22-21 is improved to now encompass from the edge of left nare to the outer canthus of left eye, into the edge of the left ear canal and the edge of the jaw.

I could breathe fine, but it felt as if it was swelling and it felt weird to swallow. I didn&#39;t want to overreact so I waited a total of 30 minutes and symptoms subsided. My throat still felt weird, but I could breathe so I felt it was fine to leave. Symptoms subsided more once I got home 30 minutes later, but I took Benadryl. Symptoms eased completely and did not return.

A 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL1283) intramuscular on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux, antidepressant, normally wears contacts and puts reading glasses on over it. Family medical history of cancer. Concomitant medication included omeprazole (PROTONIX [OMEPRAZOLE]) for acid reflux and bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) as antidepressant. The patient went and got her first shot 2 weeks ago. She is a dental assistant. She woke up between 2am-3am on 13Jan2021 and her hands and feet were itching off. They were burning and itching and she did not have any rash. So Thursday, she had to work until 1. Her hands itched and she went home, took Benadryl and put Cortisone cream on hands and feet. She does not have a dose, lot or expiration for either. It would take 2 doses of Benadryl. They just continued to itch until Saturday and she went to a doc in the box and the doctor felt it was a reaction from the vaccine. You could not see anything except red where she scratched it. She gave her some medicine and she just went to pharmacy and the pharmacist said that is just like Benadryl. She started taking it and it immediately helped, but she only gave it to her for 5 days and when she finished, the itching started again. On 27Jan2021, her hands were itching off and she has red streaks going up arms and splotches. She does not have the name. It was like hydro something. She threw bottle away. She does not have a dose, lot or expiration. It improved and stopped when she was taking the medicine and on 26Jan2021, she had a real red spot on wrist, her hands have itched and itched. When her arms started stinging and itching, she pulled her sleeve up and it looks like streaks on her arms and elbows. She has these splotchy red whelps and streaks up her arm. She also noticed she had itching on her torso the day before. She needed to get glasses to see vaccine card. This was required before she took the vaccine, but she did feel like her eyes are worse all of a sudden. She normally wears contacts and puts reading glasses on over it. It has only been in the last few weeks that she has noticed this. Now, her arms were starting to itch again after a dose of Benadryl. She was worried about 2nd shot. She does not want it to get worse and continue. She would like to speak with someone to find out if it would be recommended for her to get second dose or not. No ER or physician&#39;s office required: Doctor visit on 16Jan2021 and they prescribed a medication to help with itching and burning for 5 days and it worked and when she stopped taking it, it started back. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The facility where the vaccine was administered was at a Clinic for the hospital. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events itching and eyes have gotten worse was not recovered, events burning and pain in arm was unknown and recovering for the other events.

                                                I have a 3 inch in diameter mass of swollen lymph nodes under my left arm (had both shots in left arm).  I read online that this is a sign of my body fighting the vaccine and it is a good sign.  I went to my doctor just to have it checked out and because both of my eyes look like I have pink eye.  My doctor isn&#39;t sure if my eyes have anything to do with the vaccine but said probably not.  She said that I needed to report my mass as it is not one of the most common side effects.  I also went to the health department, where I had both shots, and had them look at the mass.  They said the same thing about my body fighting the vaccine.  My doctor and the health department said that while they have seen the swollen lymph nodes from the shot, they haven&#39;t seen such a large mass like mine.  Both of them said I needed to report this.

This 52-year-old non-pregnant female consumer received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported) via unknown route of administration, in the left arm, on 12Feb2021at 09:30 AM (age at the time of vaccination 52 years), at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the hospital. Patient&#39;s medical history included hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, primary hypertension, seasonal affective depression and flu. Patient had no known allergies. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported) via unknown route of administration, in left arm on 22Jan2021 at 09:30 AM (age at the time of vaccination 52 years), at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the hospital. The patient had no allergies with medications, food or other products. Concomitant medications in two weeks included levothyroxine sodium(thyroxine), sertraline, hyoscyamine and lisinopril. On 12Feb2021, the patient was a little sore that day, but not the next, vaccine site started being sore. On 14Feb2021 patient spent an hour shoveling snow in the morning, but wasn&#39;t sore afterwards. On 14Feb2021 (8 plus hours after shoveling snow), the vaccine site started being sore, but the pain was on again/off again. As the evening progressed the throbbing pain spread across my pectorals, up to my chin, and all the way to my other arm. All of the joints in both arms ached, 600 mg ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help. On 15Feb2021(Morning), the injection site is a little sore, the joints in her left arm are sore, and, weirdly, her left hip aches. The throbbing pain last night wasn&#39;t like any over-used muscle soreness I&#39;ve ever experienced and the joint aching was also unlike anything I&#39;ve experienced outside of when I&#39;ve had the flu. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks or prior vaccination. No COVID-19 prior the vaccination and no COVID-19 test was done post vaccination. Patient&#39;s treatment medication included ibuprofen. Outcome of the events were recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I developed a raised rash on my left arm at injection site , had chills and nausea and lots of tenderness at injection site at 3 am (1/1/21)  following injection. The nausea had resolved when I woke up, the rash subsided throughout the day as did the chills.  The most distressing event began on 1/1/2021 , that being sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes which continued and got much worse over the next two days, despite taking sudafed as often as possible.  No other cold or flu symptoms were present and it felt like allergies although I have never had any sort of seasonal allergies.  I finally took Zyrtec for it the evening of 1/3/21 and the symptoms stopped.   Congestion, light sensitivity remain.  I am reluctant to take another dose due to  drowsiness side effect.  Hoping symptoms will all be gone by tomorrow.

Also I continued to have the itchiness, sore lymph nodes in the left arm (injection arm).   Today is 48 hours post vac and I continue to have the red, raised, warm and itchy swollen circle at the injection site with soreness in the lymph node glands on left arm.

Occurred within the 5-15 min observation period.  I did not speak up about it as I was trying to analyze it myself and rationalize the symptoms.  It did not cause tachycardia or SOB or intervention but it makes me a little hesitant for the 2nd dose due to my shellfish allergy/sensitivity.   The sensation reminded me of the systemic response when receiving a contrast IV dye.   I did leave a message at the VAERS 800# to ask if I should submit this form but did not want to delay any longer in case this information is helpful with the feedback/data for others.  I understand it is not a true &#34;adverse or sentinel&#34; event but I wanted to report my reaction especially with the shellfish allergy (which I wasn&#39;t aware of to be a risk factor until I read more articles about it).

This 53-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine) (dose #1), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 07Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 53-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included food allergy (shellfish) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, drug hypersensitivity (sulfa) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, migraine headaches from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and contrast media allergy (lodine dye) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included propranolol (PROPRANOLOL), vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) and ascorbic acid, zinc (VITAMIN C &#43; ZINC). The patient previously took avelox and experienced drug hypersensitivity. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. On 07Jan2021 at 14:30, the patient experienced metallic taste in mouth, cotton mouth and flush/tingly sensation in extremities (like when receiving IV contrast dye) after receiving vaccine for about an hour after. She did not tell anyone, just tried to work through it. The patient thought it was strange. She has a shellfish allergy/sensitivity, not sure if it was related. On 08Jan2021 (reported as the following day after vaccination), the patient experienced low grade fever, chills, malaise and body aches. Therapeutic measures taken included Advil and Tylenol. The clinical outcome of metallic taste in mouth, cotton mouth, flush/tingly sensation in extremities, low grade fever, chills, malaise and body aches was resolved on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The left arm felt like battery acid, hurt super bad. Felt like an outer body experience. Was given Benadryl.  Was having a problem clearing her throat. Felt weird by her bellybutton, felt like she had on a corset on. Rash developed at sternum and bellybutton. Went over to her ER at work. The knee to the hip felt like she had cement on them. Her tongue started to swell. She was wheeled up to tramum2. She blackout at some point.  Her body was doing one thing and her mind another. She had EpiPen stat.  Right was twitching like Parkinson&#39;s.  After 1 1/2 she started feeling a little better. 69/43 bp recorded. The next few days she felt like she had Mono.

A 53-year-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 for given since patient works with COVID patients (COVID-19 immunisation). The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Nurse called asking if she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine 6 days after the 21st day. She tested positive on 05Jan2021 after getting the 1st dose and was still in quarantine. The nurse works at a hospital. She received her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Dec2020, and afterwards donated blood on the same day. She got the vaccine through her place of work. She said when she donated blood on 19Dec2020, her blood was tested for the COVID-19 Virus antibodies, and her blood was negative for the virus antibodies. She lives about 30 mins from work, so she thought she would get both done in the same day. She gave blood right before she got the vaccine. She gave the blood then went and got the Vaccine. She said on 26Dec2020 she went to Entertainment complex as it was her vacation. Her and her family went for 4 days. On 30Dec2020 she returned home with sniffles, fatigue, and no taste. She said she tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus on 05Jan2021. On 30Dec2020 they got back, and on 02Jan2021 she had sniffles and post nasal drip. On 03Jan2021 she did not wanna get out of bed. She was profoundly fatigued. She also lost her smell. She had to go back to work on 07Jan2021, but did not want to go back in unless she was sure she was okay because she works with babies. She had no other symptoms after 03Jan2021, except no smell and no taste. She got tested for COVID and was positive on 05Jan2021 (also reported as 06Jan2021 [pending clarification]). Her and her husband were both positive, but her kids were not. The weird thing was she also on 06Jan2021 got her results back from giving blood and she was negative for COVID on 19Dec2020 prior to getting the vaccine. Caller clarifies that her COVID test was a nasal swab. Patient thought her age may have contributed to her feelings of fatigue. She had indicated she worked in either a hospital NICU or nursery, and that is why she had to quarantine for 14 days. She probably would not have even gotten tested for COVID if she was not a nurse and did not know that losing taste and smell were a sign. She feels fine. She said she was scheduled for her second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021. She said she was now in quarantine for 14 days due to testing positive for the COVID-19 Virus, and her quarantine period ends on 14Jan2021. Since now she is in quarantine, she will miss her second dose which was supposed to be on 12Jan2021. She said she rescheduled her second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine to 18Jan2021, which was 6 days later than when she was supposed to receive the 2nd COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She asked if getting the dose 6 days late was okay. The events were considered as non-serious by the reporter. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment hence, the events are conservatively assessed as related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 until further information becomes available.

While most symptoms resolved with a dose of acetaminophen followed a few hours later with a dose of ibuprofen by 1600 the same day, the tiredness and abdominal pain lingered for four days, and the ringing in the ears is remaining persistent. The ringing has not yet ceased (today is day five post vaccination).

She confirmed that on 07Jan2021, she had a Rapid test for COVID, and the results came back the same day, as Positive. She was told that she should also have a 48-hour test, so she had that performed as well, and that one also came back positive, but she knew it would, because by then she had lost her taste and smell. The patient is scheduled for her 2nd dose 19Jan2021. She was wanting to know if she can still get the 2nd dose. She was told she needed to wait 30 days from her positive diagnosis before she could get the 2nd dose. She added that she will still be in isolation when her 2nd dose is due. Outcome of the events was unknown.

However,  the chest tightness, wheezing may possibly be associated with the patient&#39;s history of asthma. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

                                                Within a few minutes of getting the injection my face began tingling.  A few minutes after that the tingling turned into a burning feeling.  My cheeks were slightly flushed but felt like I had a bad sunburn.  At the same time my throat felt thick.  I could talk and breathe but it definitely felt like it had swelled inside my throat.  I also felt shaky.  My hands were not shaky but I felt shaky on the inside.  I didn&#39;t report this to the people working the vaccine clinic (but in retrospect I should have) The thick throat feeling resolved within one hour and the face burning feeling was gone by the next morning.  Then I just had the typical sore arm, a few body aches and nothing else. Note: never a vaccine reaction but I had an anaphylactic reaction requiring treatment when receiving a 2nd dose of chemotherapy

                                                One week after the vaccine I was find until....I got out of my car after driving and started staggering and could not function.  Severe dizziness, heavy headedness , nausea and vomiting and a horrible headache.  My husband had to physically muscle me back to my car. He wanted to take me to the ER and I would not let him because of the waiting room is full of COVID positive patients.  I threw up along the way home and multiple times to the point I had drive heaves.  I am a Registered Nurse and felt the symptoms I were experiencing were Vertigo.  I had one bout with Vertigo in 2015 and it was extreme.  I had Meclizine on hand and and took one tablet and slept.  The severity of this was so bad I could not walk unassisted or sit up without falling over. After 6 hours of sleeping I got up, dizziness continued, and vision a little off.  I still do not feel 100% I have had a headache since.  It never dawned on me this could be from the vaccine I had taken a week before.

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 15:45 on left deltoid at a single dose for prevention as frontline health worker at hospital (COVID-19 immunisation). The patient donated blood on 18th and no antibodies were present then. The patient was a former smoker and quit 2 or 3 years ago. Patient diagnosed Osteoporosis in 2015, benign heart arrhythmia in 2005. The patient took 70 mg alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX) once weekly and just a regular OTC daily multivitamin. Caller reported she was having the covid vaccine on 19Dec2020 and began having fever, night sweats, loss of taste and smell and then tested positive for covid. The patient received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine through work on 19Dec2020. She received it at 3:45 pm and should have taken temperature before, but she was afebrile the day before because she donated blood. At 7pm, she had slight temp 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit and by 10:30, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit and she still felt fine. She was surprised that it was that. She woke up at 2:30 am on 20Dec2020 and took her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took 2 Tylenol and went back to bed and felt fine. By morning it was 99 degrees Fahrenheit and then 98 degrees Fahrenheit a little later. She has been afebrile since then. She was a little tired because she gave blood and though it was related. She does not know if it was a side effect or not. It was not significant tiredness and was just not having energy in the evening of 19Dec2020. She also had soreness at injection site that night after 22:00 and the next day. It did not bother her until she woke up in the middle of night, and she noticed her left arm was sore. She received the vaccine at 3:45pm and started with low grade fever at 6:30 pm, earlier stated at 7:00 pm. There was no prescriber. She tested for COVID (PCR) on Saturday, 26Dec2020 at 14:50and it came back positive 28Dec2020 18:45. At 10pm on 19Dec2020, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If she had not been monitoring her temperature, she would not have known. She has been Afebrile since morning of 20Dec2020. Tiredness she related to giving blood and the holidays. She was a little stressed about the holidays and running around. It was very mild. Soreness at injection site was during the night after 10pm when she went to bed. On Wednesday, 23Dec2020, she woke up congested, sniffly, sneezy, with a runny nose. This persisted through Wednesday night. Her sense of taste was off. She had no problem with that on Tuesday. She had some horrible smell at work she recalled, so she knew her sense of smell was fine. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, she had no sense of taste or smell. She could not smell a pine candle. She was congested on Thursday and called employee health on 24Dec2020. This both improved and persisted. She is still congested but it has improved. She has never had a complete loss of sense of taste or smell before. Mild cough started yesterday morning. On the night of 20Dec2020, and 21Dec2020, she developed night sweats. She had not had any night sweats before this since menopause and she woke up really wet. The patient was not hospitalized and not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. She did not know if she was exposed on the day of the vaccine or if a couple of days later if the fever is from the vaccine. She stated what are the chances she goes 10 months and is super careful and then gets the vaccine and test positive. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of sever systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen nor receive mechanical ventilation. No Multiorgan failure. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID- 19. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Not any preexisting diseases worsen during the SARS-CoV2 infection. She would like to know if there is a chance of false positive for this. It would just be her luck to be 10 months and not getting it. She has not gone anywhere without her N95 and then gets the vaccine and gets COVD. She wears mask and face shield at work always. She also wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The outcome of the event slight temperature was recovered on 20Dec2020 and the other event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this patient cannot be completely excluded.

A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 30Dec2020 14:28 at the 54 years old at 0.3 mL single for where she works she was exposed to patients who need rehab that were exposed and getting COVID.  The patient medical history included Primary Essential Tremors and ongoing (had these for about 10-11 years. Her mother and grandmother also had them. Normally they were very fine, small tremors that people didn&#39;t notice. She can hold and turn her head and hide it) and Sulfa drug allergy (would get shortness of breath). The concomitant product was none. The patient previously took flu vaccine and experienced preservative made neck twitch and joint sores. Yesterday the patient got the COVID Vaccine and had a pretty significant adverse event. She was calling to report it and to see if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient was also a licensed speech pathologist. She received the vaccine yesterday at 2:28 PM. She was allergic to Sulfa drugs and would get shortness of breath, so they wanted her to wait 30 minutes for monitoring. She was feeling giddy on 30Dec2020, but she ran into a friend that she had not seen before quarantine, so they were talking. It was exciting. After her 30 minutes she went to her car and felt a little funny. She thought she was hungry so she ate half a banana and had some water. She had an appointment to get to so she started to drive off, and by the time she got to the interstate she was feeling funny. She got on her left side, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face on 30Dec2020. This was like the precursor. Then on 30Dec2020 her face started to go numb. It felt like a dental block you would get with Lidocaine. It went from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips. It was midline on the left side. She was breathing fine. She was trying to figure out if she should pull over or call(Number), but her airway did not close up. Her upper esophageal sphincter got tight and felt funny like she was going to throw up. She drove to the hospital close to her house which is affiliated with where she got the vaccine. She normally had primary tremors, small to where people do not notice. But her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs on 30Dec2020. She looked like a bobble head. But she could still breath. They took her right in and they did an EKG to make sure it was not her heart. Her blood pressure was up on 30Dec2020, she assumes for being stressed. They monitored her. They gave her Pepcid and Benadryl. She did not want any nausea medications. She stayed for about 2 hours and slept some from the Benadryl. Her face slowly became less numb. The numbness went away started from her lips and outward to her check and temple area. Then it just felt funny. When she touched it, which she never lost sensation, it was like, whose face is this? It was strange. She is not numb anymore. It took a while for it to go away, and it still felt weird. When she woke up this morning it was completely gone. She had recovered completely from all of these things. The only thing she has now was some transient nausea. It was very mild. It comes and goes. It had improved. She had not taken anything for it.  The events Feeling funny, her face started to go numb, upper esophageal sphincter got tight, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, were all assessed as Medically significant. The outcome of the event Nausea was recovering, the events Felt giddy, blood pressure was up, Stress was recovered on 31Dec2020, the other events were recovered on 30Dec2020.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events Feeling funny, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Face started to go numb from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips, upper esophageal sphincter got tight , whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, Nausea, were related to the product BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

About 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, my throat felt strange, my sinuses started getting congested, my ears started plugging.  I felt dizzy when walking.  I spent extra time at the clinic under observation.  About 40 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly felt like I was being sucked into a vacuum and thought I was going to pass out.  I alerted the nurses, who checked my vital signs and put me on O2.  My heart rate was normal, my BP was high, my O2 sat was 100%.  After about 5 minutes I started to feel normal, they removed the O2.  They continued to observe me for another 15 minutes, until I felt better.  As I drove home (about 1 hour 10 min after receiving the vaccine), my face and lips became numb.  I continued driving home and the numbness resolved in about 10-15 minutes.  I notified my doctor of the event and she advised me not to get the second dose and to report the event.

A 54-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EKQ231), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 11Jan2021, patient experienced metallic taste in mouth, which was reported as worsened and sore arm at injection site. On 12Jan2021within about an hour after vaccination, the patient experienced lowgrade fever that was slowly going up, headache, stomach ache, &amp; body ache.

There was no twitch the a muscular contraction that left me unable to walk properly (the left side seem to be the tightest side of by body) .   I also had bilateral jaw pain  (not sure if its was because I was in so much pain in the legs that I was clenching my teeth) I also  had slight numbness on by left face and by the evening I had redness on my left cheek but it went away.   My face still has a bit of muscle sensitivity (tingling sensation) near the mouth and jaw.

Had more flushing later, took benedryl.  Went to Urgent care, advised benedryl to continue, but did not feel there was any cause for concern.    Day after injection, mild flushing at times, and diffuse mild itching  including scalp, face, particularly borders, and general arms, legs, torso.  No rash, hives, and itching not aggressive, just mild.  Persisted for about a week. Feel anxiety may have played role.  Continued with benedryl.  Had telehealth visits with PCP and with allergist.  Resumed taking zyrtec daily with additional dose in pm- symptoms resolved.  Not felt to be &#34;serious&#34; reaction by either MD, feel it is ok to have 2nd dose.

                                                I had my first covid vaccine 12/22/20.  On 12/24/20 I noticed I could not see as well as normal with my RIGHT eye.  I had a sore left arm and headache, which I attributed to the vaccine.  By 12/27/20, I called the emergency number at my primary ophthalmologist as was seen.  They thought I had a posterior vitreous detachment and asked me to see my primary eye doctor in a week.  By 12/30/20 I could not see to work and called the eye doctor and they decided I should see my retinal specialist who deals with problems with my left eye.  He could see nothing to explain my decreased acuity and told me to keep my follow up at the other office.  I saw a Dr on 1/4/21, who takes care of my left eye cataract and glaucoma.  He called in an associate.  My vision had further declined and they thought I had ocular neuritis.  I couldn&#39;t see the big E on the eye chart at all at my worst.  I was scheduled for an MRI of the head, which showed ocular neuritis in my right eye.  Dr assumed care and I started IV steroids on 1/13 for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone taper.  I also was referred to a neurologist to rule out MS.  I saw Dr. 1/28/21.  After the steroids, my vision improved, but I still can&#39;t work or drive.  Neurologist does not think I have MS and is ruling out NMO but doesn&#39;t think I have that either.

Continued for 48 hours and worsened with slight drooping when smiling. Clearing my throat a lot and my right eye keeps tearing up. The doctor confirmed it was &#34;Bell&#39;s Palsy&#34; this morning and I have been put on Prednisone.

                                                Within 5 minutes of vaccine I  developed a tight cough. By 10 minutes I was wheezing, coughing and it was difficult to inhale deeply, was itchy with few hives, lips and tongue were tingling and I became dizzy. I was sent to the ER and received IV Benadryl, IV pepcis and an IV steroid along with an Albuterol breathing treatment.  Heartrate 110-115 pulse ox 94% prior to meds and breathing treatment. BP not done. Symptoms resolved but by 1200 were all back. At that time I was given Epinepherine IM. Symptoms resolved by 1pm. Discharged from hospital by 4pm.  By 5pm face numb and tingling from cheekbones to mandible. Resolved within 24hrs. Since then, I have had episodes of facial numbness and tingling, hives and overall itching, lip/tongue tingling and bronchoconstriction(not with exercise)

A 54-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 07Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included history of three spinal surgeries (takes no pain meds, she is not on pain meds, she has never been on or kept taking them); and has &#34;neuropathy and nerve related issues&#34; that were not this bad since ten years ago in 2011, clarified that what she has is not actually neuropathy, something with the peripheral nerve, she says she doesn&#39;t remember actual verbiage), since ten years ago in 2011, and the only difference was this vaccination, it was not this bad until this vaccination. She doesn&#39;t react well to pharmaceuticals anyway (unspecified). Her medications are that she takes the minimum amount of medications, very minimal (unspecified). There were no concomitant medications. There was no other products. Also, she has not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. For past drug, she didn&#39;t take anything other than 5mg of zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) to sleep at night because of her spine. Patient previously also took pregabalin (LYRICA) and was off it, was also on gabapentin or neurontin (patient did not have those medications to provide NDC/LOT/EXP for either of them because she took them back to the pharmacy or turned them in to the police station because she doesn&#39;t keep medications in her house if she isn&#39;t taking them, and she couldn&#39;t take that medication). Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 54-year-old; Lot Number: EN5318) in Arm Right for covid-19 immunization, and for her first dose the only thing was a sore arm, it was very sore, and she only experienced a slight bit of fatigue after her first dose. She received both doses of vaccine. Her first dose was LOT: EN5318 and was given 14Jan2021, and her second dose was LOT: EN6204 given 07Mar2021. The patient was reporting for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, for she was having a horrible reaction to it &#34;45 days&#34; (as reported) after taking 2nd dose, and had been in the ER, and her temperature still hasn&#39;t gone back down to her normal, her oral temp is still raised and her rectal is raised even more. She was not feeling well, she felt very bad, she would never get a vaccine again, that is how bad it was. Since &#34;45 days&#34; later she was still having significant pain and trouble flexing her right hand open and closed. For events treatment, she took over the counter Tylenol for fever and pain, strength unknown. Patient said she had not had this kind of disabling symptoms or anything before this vaccination. She had a slight fever almost the whole &#34;45 days&#34;. On 08Mar2021, her oral temp was over 98 degrees Fahrenheit when her norm temp being 97.2 or 97.3degrees Fahrenheit. Her rectal temp stayed at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The next day, actually on the 09Mar2021 (which was two days after her second dose), she had the slight fever, fatigue, and extreme pain through her right side. She said her right side means her shoulders, neck, torso, arm, and entire leg. She also had shortness of breath, and severe nerve pain. She called her primary care provider who said to wait 5 days to be seen. On day 5, or actually the whole five days (reported as in Mar2021), she was in bed and didn&#39;t leave her apartment because she was in bed and she was vomiting. On day 2 or within 6 hours of vaccination, she had a feeling of urination, like she had to urinate when she didn&#39;t, that feeling of urination was equivalent of having contrast dye (NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown) put in her IV which makes her feel like she is peeing her pants but she did not, and that feeling has not gone away. On day 5 (11Mar2021), she was dizzy and fell. In Mar2021, she was disorientated and vomiting, she couldn&#39;t eat anything other than soup. On day two (Mar2021) she had some kind of eye pain that is still there &#34;45 days later&#34;, it feels like pins and needles. Her skin was burning and painful to the touch, she couldn&#39;t keep an IV in her when she was in the ER. She was not admitted to the hospital. She was having headaches, and joint and muscle pain. She had nausea and vomiting at different times. She continued to have shortness of breath. She had a horrible lack of appetite. She had sores in her mouth and nose. She had anal hemorrhoid sores. Last night (05Apr2021 )she had a headache that was severe like someone put a knife behind her right eye, and when she got up (06Apr2021) her eye felt heavy and her eye was drooping. She also had difficulty speaking, with her words. She says she had passed out, and had been dropping things, she had broken glass. She has been to a neurologist and a gastroenterologist. She clarified that all of these events were after her second dose, for her first dose the only thing was a sore arm, it was very sore, and she only experienced a slight bit of fatigue after her first dose. None of her doctors know what to do, her gastro doctor was giving her an anti inflammatory suppository and was going to do some tests. She had blood done from neurologist and at the ER and no one knows what to do, they keep referring her to other doctors. She wished someone could explain to her, but no one know and they said it was uncharted territory, they didn&#39;t know what to do. She is now back on Lyrica which she was off of but the ER prescribed her 300mg three times a day. She wanted to know what the hell is going on with this vaccine, and that she doesn&#39;t think having these side effects &#34;45 days&#34; out is normal. She wanted to be transferred to speak with someone about what to do because her doctor&#39;s don&#39;t know anything. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I began to experience a dry throat about 10 minutes after injection - I attributed it to needing a drink. My throat then felt a bit warm and I thought this was due to thirst as well. I left the monitoring area. I was walking to my vehicle and began to feel more of a warm sensation in my throat and not into my upper chest. About 5 minutes after this took place my face became flush and began tingling and feeling sunburned and tight - I looked in the mirror and my cheeks and nose and chin were red and felt extremely warm - I did not have facial swelling that i noticed buy my face felt tingly and like it was sunburned - my eye felt puffy but did not look puffy enough to notice in the mirror. Approximately 30-35 minutes after the immunization,  I took 50mg of Benadryl and 1300mg of Tylenol. I felt my symptoms begin to improve  about 25-30 minutes after taking the medication - my throat and chest were not as warm.  the facial flushing lasted about an hour or hour and a half.   The morning after my immunization I did have a scratchy throat - I did not take any further medication - by the afternoon - this is almost gone - still just a little scratchy.

Came to report to me (lead RPh for clinic) at 11:50am. I spoke with another staff member to get patient 50mg of benadryl. While I waited for the medicine, I inspected the patients arm, face and inside the mouth. No redness, swelling, hives or other signs/symptoms of allergic reaction. Arm looked normal, no discoloration. Same with face and inside mouth. Patient took 50mg Benadryl at 12pm. Patient also stated having sinus issues currently (before vaccination) and has had off/on reactions with flu shot and other vaccines, mainly itching in the arm that was injected and swelling at the injection site (grapefruit size). Patient reported feeling itchiness gone at 12:10pm but still having some numb tongue. By 12:23pm, patient reported feeling completely better and no more numbness in the tongue.

After release I went to my car and started to drive home.  At the 25 minute mark post vaccine (1:55pm)  I felt numbness and tingling of cheeks and lips (no swelling and no difficulty breathing).  I drove the nearby adult hospital, parked on a side street to wait and see if anything got worse.  After 10 minutes symptoms subsided and I continued home.  At the 50 minute mark post vaccine (2:20) I felt numbness and tingling of my right arm which subsided after 10 minutes.  No further side effects.

                                                Later that night after the vaccination I woke up hot, my body was achy all over, I had a headache and begin to cough.  I took another dose of cough meds but it didnt work.  That next morning I visited my PCP and my temp was 98.7 when I arrived but the temp elevated to 99.9 while there and another temp was taken shortly after and was 100.8 so I was advised to go back home.  Once home I was so tired and weak I could barely make it to the couch.  My temp  then was 101 so I laid down.  The couch was so bad it caused my throat to begin to hurt.  I lost my taste and sense smell, my body ached so bad it was unbareable and I developed various bruises all over my body still while continue to cough presistantly.  I was off work for about 3 days and those 3 days were the worse days of my life, I was so unconfortable and scared it was almost unbareable I thought I was going to die. And on Thursday the symptoms begin to diminish and by that night it was if nothing had ever happened.

Two weeks after I had the 1st vaccine, I ate shell fish.  30 to 45 minutes later, I had a terrible reaction.  I had a bad back ache.  I felt like I was going to faint and felt very dizzy.  I had severe diarreha and had hot flashes and forehead sweats.  I barely made it to my bed and went to sleep.

                                                getting a weird ringing, buzzing noise in the ears that keeps coming and going; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 55-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 17:00 (at the age of 55 years old), as a single dose (Dose 1) for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient got the Pfizer vaccine at 5PM &#34;yesterday&#34; (20Jan2021) and did fine. This morning (21Jan2021) at 10AM  she experienced getting a weird ringing, buzzing noise in the ears that keeps coming and going. She has never had this before. The clinical outcome of the event(s) was not reported. She wanted to know why she is getting this and if it was normal at this point.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 55-year-old adult female received the first dose of BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot EN6202 and expiry information not provided) via unspecified route in the left arm on 03Mar2021 between 17:10 and 17:30 (at 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Frozen shoulder (2020-2020), and severe migraines (especially in the past ten years). The patient further stated that she has always had migraines. She said sometimes when her migraines escalate, her blood pressure goes up, and her left side tingles. She said several times in the past, she thought her migraine symptoms may have been a stroke. She said she her doctor is checking her for any kind of things like rheumatoid arthritis, mast cells, constant (chronic) fatigue, and fibromyalgia. She said right before the COVID-19 Virus pandemic she had passed out unexpectedly. She said she doesn&#39;t know what caused her to pass out. She said she needs another neurological test done. She said she had a neurological test that maybe showed that veins were dying in her brain, but she wasn&#39;t sure. She said her doctor had been doing heart tests too, but because of the pandemic, it was taking longer to have the tests done. The patient also mentioned that her last blood work was probably in/around Nov2020. There were no concomitant medications or past drug history reported. The patient denied receiving any other vaccination within the four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient also denied receiving any other vaccination on the same date as the vaccination. The patient reported that on 04Mar2021, approximately seventeen hours after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she had what she thought was a kind of severe reaction. She said she had an inside numbness and tingling all over her body. She said the left side of her body, especially, had a very strong numbness and tingling, like a stroke. She said the numbness was in her left hand, and outside left shoulder. She said the left half of her face was numb. She said at the time she felt weird. She said she was speaking to her friend on a video call and did not want her friend to think she was a cry baby. She said then her friend told her there was something happening with her face. She said the right side of her face had dropped. She said her right eye and the right side of her mouth were drooping. She said she told her friend she thought she had an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine.  She said it took about three hours for her symptoms to pass. She said afterward she was so tired, had pain, and a headache. She said it was strange for her to have a headache because she was used to migraines. She said she still had a headache today (08Mar2021). She said she had a heaviness with her headache. She said if she had a migraine, she would not be able to do anything, but with the headache she had, she was able to go about her everyday things. She said her stomach was bothering her too, but she was not worried about how her stomach felt. The events did not require any visits to a physician&#39;s office nor the emergency room. Treatment for the events included drinking a lot of water and moving around. The outcome of the events, inside numbness and tingling all over her body, very strong numbness and tingling, like a stroke¸ numbness was in her left hand, and outside left shoulder, half of her face was numb, right side of her face had dropped, and tongue looked swollen, and allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine was recovered on 04Mar2021 after about three hours duration. The outcome of the events so tired, and pain was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021. The outcome of the events, headache, and heaviness with her headache was not recovered.

                                                Received the vaccine at 330p.  Began to have mild upper eyelid itching around 11:59p.   Eyes felt swollen then began to feel nauseous (tried to vomit, but no food came up) and then a runny nose  (clear fluid).   I took another Claritin 10mg and also Zofran 8mg ODT which resolved the nausea.  Had to blow my nose 2 times.   Went to sleep with my Epipen at bedside but didnt have to use it.   Woke up at 815am and only symptom remaining was arm soreness.   Felt like my normal self and played 3 hrs of tennis.  Arm soreness at injection site worsened during the day.  By 72 hrs post-injection, arm soreness resolved.

On exam, she had left facial droop consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy. She was monitored for about an hour with no further progress, and some visible improvement. She had tremor of right hand. By next day, patient reported complete resolution of symptoms. Of note, patient has multiple sclerosis and will have similar symptoms when she has a flare.   Jen Silvey spoke with patient on 1/6/2021 @ 2051:    &#34;Her face - no droop to left side of her face and lips- back to normal.   But her tongue is still tingling.&#34;

Started with upper lip on 1/22/21 and then my eyes were swollen, bruised and painful upon waking 1/23/21 and lasted until early morning of 1/25/21.   My whole face was sore to touch during this time.   I also had fatigue and headache starting 1/21/21 which lasted a few days along with  fever, chills,  body aches and  sore left armpit which started early morning 1/22/21.  I had expected these last symptoms so was not alarmed.  I was not warned about the facial  swelling and that was a bit scary.

A 56-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular (IM) in right deltoid on 07Jan2021 15:30 at second single dose for preventative. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016 for immunisation and experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue, first dose bnt162b2, via IM in left deltoid for preventative on 18Dec2020 at 18:00 and patient was tender in her left arm, the first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. No prior other vaccinations administered within 4 weeks. The patient took the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Thursday 07Jan2021 at 15:30. She called employee health and was advised to call Pfizer to report side effects since she is not feeling good. She had never had the covid diagnosis. On Friday (08Jan2021) she worked all day and felt arm soreness and sinus congestion but nothing out of the ordinary. The patient reported her right arm was still tender to touch, if she rotated her arm she can feel that she had the shot and she was still tender in her left arm from the first shot. The first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. On 08Jan2021 evening she felt really lightheaded, she thought maybe it was her sinuses since it is dry due to winter. She felt like a truck hit her. She had a low grade headache. On 09Jan2021, she felt a little nauseous, queasy, no vomiting. On Saturday (09Jan2021) she had a low grade temp of 100.3 degrees F. She had the chills and shakes on Saturday and most of yesterday. She got up today (reported on 12Jan2020) at 5:30 am, she checked her temperature and it was 97.2 after the shower, an hour later it was 98 degrees F. She felt like she had to keep clearing her throat, her chest felt a bit tight which started Friday evening, the chest tightness was not terrible but it was there. She was not wheezing but when she took a deep breath she felt a little like a wheeze and she had to cough, she had a scratchy throat on 09Jan2020. She stayed home from work yesterday. The patient did not feel lightheaded today, felt it yesterday and did not notice it at all this morning, reported it has resolved. The sinus pressure and congestion started Friday night, she felt stuffy. She had a decreased sense of smell and taste on 09Jan2021. Unless something is right in front of her, she could not smell anything. She felt quite nauseous this morning but at the moment her nausea is under control. She had a decreased sense of taste, everything she ate or drunk had a metallic taste to it, on 09Jan2021. She felt that all the side effects mentioned were related to getting the vaccine. On 08Jan2021, she also experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue which had improved after a hot shower, that helped. She felt like she had a bad flu shot. The only time she ever felt similar to this was when she received the H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016. She did not have lot number, NDC, or expiration date to provide. Treatment included: took Tylenol on Saturday. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office (she is trying to get an appointment to see the doctor). Outcome of the event lightheaded was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events low grade headache, chest tightness, scratchy throat, sinus pressure and congestion, decreased sense of smell, decreased sense of taste, everything she eat or drinks has a metallic taste to it, arm soreness was not recovered, of events chills and shakes, muscle stiffness, fatigue was recovering, of other events was unknown. Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.

A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 15:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a skilled nursing facility or long term care facility. The patient received no other vaccinations recently. Medical history included attention deficit disorder diagnosed at least 5 years ago for which the patient was taking Ritalin; hypothyroidism diagnosed a long time ago, probably 10 years and depression diagnosed a long time ago, probably at least 25 year, she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this (no further details provided about her anti-depressants). The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function/eyes could not focus before when her doctor put her on an antibiotic (unspecified). The patient was also very overweight. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN; lot: unknown, expiry: 28Jul2021) for attention deficit disorder and the patient takes a cocktail of anti-depressants (unspecified) for her depression. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 3 PM and by 5PM she was experiencing bad headache, fever, L arm (injection site) pain that was severe. Later that evening she had blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function. She also got a fever of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, was dizzy and her eyes could not focus and were almost like double vision but not quite, it was hard to explain. She just remembered that she had a similar reaction with her eyes before, when her doctor put her on an antibiotic. She cannot recall what antibiotic that was. The patient also experienced dizziness on 11Jan2021. The patient treated her side effects with ibuprofen and most of these improved. The injection was given in her left arm, her non-dominate one. She says that the pain was so bad it woke her up, and she doesn&#39;t take any pain meds, but that was really bad. She says that she took some Ibuprofen (lot: P113671, exp: Jan2022), about a total of 800mg over a few hours. Her fever had started pretty fast, by 05:00PM on the 11th, and it was better after taking the Ibuprofen, as was her arm pain, and headache. She says that the dizziness went away probably around 02:00AM the following day (12Jan2021). She says her eyes can focus again as well. The patient thinks that these effects are medically significant, mostly that her eyes were not able to focus, it was very scary. The patient stated that the purpose of this call is to have this documented, and possibly find out if there are recommendations that she should not get the second dose, since she had to call out of work because she couldn&#39;t function. The outcome of the event &#34;blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function; eyes wouldn&#39;t focus, couldn&#39;t function&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date and dizziness recovered on 12Jan2021 at 02:00. The outcome of the event &#34;she had to call out of work because she couldn&#39;t function&#34; was unknown while the other events were recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 56-year-old female patient had medical history included attention deficit disorder; hypothyroidism and depression and she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this. The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function/eyes could not focus. Based on information reported, the reported double vision and difficulty focusing eyes were more likely due to pre-existing condition (s); and less likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The rest events fever, headache, vaccination site pain and dizziness were likely causally related to the use of vaccine due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Tightness in my chest like a panic attack - I&#39;ve never had one but this is what it seemed like. I would deep breath to calm down. Took my Pulse/O2 and it was 98%  and 62BPM  and BP was 107/58 that day (6 Feb). Took it the next day and we had a 98% and BPM of 58 and BP went to 148/72 ( very unusual for me). 4 days later took Pulse/O2 at 98% 58BPM and BP at 120/62.  I feel pain in the center of my chest where my heart is and I have never had this in my life until 2 days after the vaccination. I am now taking  a lung support (Clear Lungs - Nutritional Therapeutics) in case I have a lung issue. I live at 5000&#39; and can walk and I now only do light exercise so I don&#39;t feel the heaviness  or &#34;stress&#34; feeling in my heart. I have not gone to the dr yet. On 8 Feb my chest was really hurting and did feel some pain on my lower jaw and this went on for about 2 hrs. I did not go to the hospital. Something is wrong since getting this shot even though the symptoms are subsiding. Again, for someone without comorbidities or a history of her heart ever hurting to have this happen 1 1/2 days after the vaccine is not a coincidence and from all data that can be found this is an anomaly.  I am troubled and concerned about my reaction.

                                                Woke up the next morning and she felt numbness in her ear.  She could hear, but it felt muffled.  As the day went on she realized that her ear was ringing.  It started as a buzzing and now a high pitched ringing that she still has in her left ear.  She also had a nose bleed that occurred twice on her right nostril.  She has had nose bleeds in the past, but none recently.   She was sitting working and her nose just started bleeding.  The vaccine site itself was sore, minor and not unbearable.  It&#39;s just the humming and buzzing in her ear that will not go away.

                                                The vaccine site was Community Center being done by Paramedics and Fire Fighters. I received the vaccine and sat down in the chairs to wait the required 15 minutes. Within 2-3 minutes my face got very hot. I could feel the heat under my mask. Another minute or two, just below my knees to my toes started tingling. Another two minutes or so, I felt like my eyes were swelling. I took my glasses off and looked at my husband and asked if my eyes are swelling, he said, they sure are and called over one of the paramedics that were there. They directed me to a more private are and put me on a monitor and monitored my vital signs. My blood pressure which is well controlled on my meds (which I did take that morning) climbed and climbed to 200s/100s. My chest was tight and uncomfortable and getting more difficult to breath. They put and 02 mask on and gave me Benadryl IM. By that time the squad was there and took me to the local hospital ER. In the squad my tongue started to swell. At the hospital they gave me Solumedrol IV which took care of it all. The swelling quickly went away in my tongue and face, the chest pressure went away, and all the other little annoyances like the tingling. The hospital did a chest x-ray and bloodwork. I went home after 3-4 hours with a prescription for Prednisone 50 mg daily for 5 days.  No further reactions after that.

A 56-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 16Mar2021 09:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7534) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant. No Known allergies. The patient took other medications (many, none new) in two weeks. The patient experienced angioedema, swelling of lips, numbness in tongue and mouth on 16Mar2021. The AEs resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received zyrtec and allegra and epi pen for prn use. No covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the product&#39;s known safety profile,  there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the event angioedema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Took aleve prior to receiving vaccine. Has known allergy to celebrex which causes mouth/lips to swell and break out in hives. Approx. 45 minutes later she became flushed, felt lightheaded/intoxicated/giddy/silly while driving home. She said she was extremely hungry (&#34;like a big dose of steroids&#34;). She states her ears were ringing and when she laid down at 2130 she could feel her heart beating throughout her body. This AM she reports feeling &#34;hungover/groggy/nauseated&#34;. She denied any lip/tongue swelling, any lip or extremity tingling, difficulty breathing, any injection site redness/heat/swollen/painful area, fever, chills, or ever having a vaccine reaction previously. Spoke with individual w/pharmacy. Advised to report to VAERS. Not an expected reaction. Possibly related to aleve vs. covid vaccine.

A 57-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Lot: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on deltoid right on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, hypothyroidism, and environmental allergies. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC) at 10 mg, daily for blood pressure high, and levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT) at 112 mcg (ug) for hypothyroidism. Patient got Covid Vaccine on Tuesday (22Dec2020) night and was fine on Wednesday (23Dec2020). She expected the normal side effects like maybe a little fever like that but she believed she was having allergic reactions. It started from 24Dec2020 and she got a rash on all her chest and in abdomen and also just like itchiness feeling all over. So she took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and a PPI &#39;a cup of&#39; them on 24Dec2020 and she thought that she only had to do that one&#39;s today (25Dec2020) and the only thing she noticed when she got the shot (Covid Vaccine) they kept her there for like 15 minutes and her eyes got red and itch. She didn&#39;t scratch them but they felt like itchy and she never had that before. She never had a problem with the vaccine before. She didn&#39;t know if that was the true allergic reaction to the vaccines or if it just something she had internal allergies and she just didn&#39;t know what it was. But she was okay at the time of the report. She took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride a little while before and a PPI (unspecified medication). She was still itchy but it was not that bad and she seemed to be doing fine. Her arm was fine. She was not having any (unspecified), except sometimes. 24Dec2020 she had chills which she expected and she was all good but the side effects whatever happened that way was not the allergic portion. She tried to contact the doctor. The doctor just switched his clinic only for geriatric patients. She had to find another doctor. She knew a Doctor whom she could try and call and she actually went to the infectious disease physician and he said she should go to get the vaccine, now she was trying with that too. She got allergic to anything. Covid Shot was the only thing new that she had in her life but like she was not sure if it was triggered by something out like (unspecified) because she had always environmental allergies too. She didn&#39;t know because she was going to consult the Physician on Monday. She was just going to see the regular doctor. She was just seeing that first that anything because she knew it didn&#39;t happen very often but the Covid vaccine she just wanted to make report. She was going to the Physician on Monday because right now she thought she didn&#39;t know how long it lasted like. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Next afternoon, Jan 5, I got severe myalgias, fever up to 100, severe fatigue, went home after work and slept til the next morning, went to work, took ibuprofen, and the myalgias improved and felt better. But around 3 pm, Jan 6, I got mild vertigo. By about 7pm Jan 6, I noticed my L ear didn&#39;t hear well. I changed the battery in my hearing aide and cleaned it but It made no difference. I woke up on Jan 7 with severe vertigo and hearing loss. I did Epley&#39;s maneuvers with no effect. I have had similar episodes. I went to work, but gave up when I could not hear patients talking to me. I went to the Emergency Dept and got admitted. I was too unsteady on my feet. Audiogram showed profound hearing loss both ears and almost complete loss of discrmination in R ear. I was put on high dose steroids. Also having tinnitus (mostly whooshing sound of my own pulse). MRI negative. Blood work negative. Some mild improvement now, after 1 dose steroids.

A 57-year-old female patient received the second dose of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 16:45 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included, lactose intolerance. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.), probiotics (PROBIOTICS), clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]), ibuprofen (MOTRIN [IBUPROFEN]), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took Parafon Forte and experienced allergies. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ek5730) on 17Dec2020 17:15 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced aches, chills, menstrual like cramps, fatigue, eye burning, and low grade temp on 07Jan2021 15:00. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events were assessed as non-serious. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number EJ1685, expiration date: 31Mar2021), intramuscularly on 20Dec2020 17:43 at left deltoid, at single dose for vaccination. Medical history included asthma and diabetes. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 20Dec2020. On 22Dec2020 she was exposed to Covid, on 28Dec2020 developed symptoms of cough, chills, lost of taste and smell, she had onset of COVID virus symptoms on 28Dec2020 with positive COVID result from COVID nasal swab test performed on 29Dec2020. She has already completed her Bamlanivimab infusion therapy to treat COVID virus on 31Dec2020. Her 2nd dose is due on 10Jan2020 and she wanted information on the use of antibody therapy with the Covid-19 vaccine. She asked if she should still get the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled on 10Jan2021 relative to these events. She reported she still has COVID symptoms which have improved, but the symptoms she can&#39;t taste or smell are ongoing and persistent. Seriousness criteria: she thought it was serious but she was not injured or anything with it; she thought event was offset it by taking some medication and the Bamlanivimab infusion. In addition to Bamlanivimab infusion for treatment of the COVID virus she was also prescribed Azithromycin for 5 days started on 29Dec2020 which she completed; and Prednisone for 7 days started on 29Dec2020 which she stopped after 5 days of therapy because she did not like how it made her feel. The outcome of the event was recovering. Event relatedness between Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and COVID virus was unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, lack of efficacy of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. However, individuals may not be protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. It is unlikely that the patient would have fully developed immunity due to the very short time lag between the first vaccine dose and the event onset.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure from 2008 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine from 2017 and ongoing at 5 mg at night for high blood pressure, losartan from 2017 and ongoing at 12mg once in the morning for high blood pressure. Following her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020, the patient had throat tightening, metallic taste in her mouth. She was scheduled to have her 2nd dose today (07Jan2021) and would like to know what to do and if she was still covered 80% from the 1st dose of her COVID vaccine shot. When she got her first COVID shot 3 weeks ago she got a metallic taste in her mouth and her throat tightened up a little. Throat tightening happened right after she got the shot and lasted about less than 2 minutes. She also turned red when she got it. Then about 14 hours later, on the same day she got nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak. This lasted until about 20Dec2020 as well. She was supposed to get 2nd dose today (07Jan2021). Before her first shot she had taken paracetamol and hydrochloride prior. She also took both of those today (07Jan2021). But then she was reading through the paperwork and it says that a severe reaction includes tightening of the throat. She was not sure if what she had was truly a reaction or not. She did not have other allergies. She had many flu shots and never had any difficulty with those. She was a nurse, she wanted the second dose, but she was concerned about the throat tightening, and it getting worse with the second dose. She was unsure of seriousness. She figured that she would get aches and pains. Everyone else who got it said their arm hurt, but nothing else. She thought it was weird. She was just wired differently she guesses. The action taken in response to the events for paracetamol and hydrochloride was  unknown. The outcome of events throat tightening, turned red was recovered on 17Dec2020. The outcome of event metallic taste in her mouth, nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak was recovered on 20Dec2020.

I took 2 Benadryl and in about hour the lump feeling was not as bad, lump feeling subsided. I had muscle joint pain the next 4 days and stayed on Benadryl those days until throat and ears felt better. On day 5 my left arm started stinging and broke out in hives , some on torso but mainly vaccinated left arm. I went to primary care to talk to her about my reactions on day -7 . She documented in my records but told me to report through Vsafe  app. I did. I do not want to take 2nd dose after having this happened and no one able to tell me the 2nd wont be worse,

Received my  2nd Pfizer vaccine 1/31/2021 1130 am 6 hours later at 6:30 pm ate packaged veggie dumplings and 15 min later my tongue swelled and my face felt swollen and itchy.  Took  Benadryl 25mg, Allegra 180mg and Pepcid 20mg with relief.   6 hours later, awoke  with itchy throat and face  and took Benadryl 25mg with relief.   Next morning, 2/1/2021:  8 am ate  my regular breakfast of peanut butter on toast and 15 minutes later my face started itching. Took Allegra 180mg with relief.  11:30 ate pretzels and face started itching `15 minutes later.   Everything I ate that day caused me to itch 15 min afterwards  just like when I  would have food reactions when first diagnosed with Alpha Gal  and my IGE histamine levels with 3x normal.   I increased my Allegra 180mg to  3x a day for 24 hours and Pepcid 20mg to 2x a day for 24 hours.   48hours after vaccine  I was able to decrease Allegra 180mg  to 2x a day with Pepcid 20mg to 2x a day and was able to eat bland food without itching afterwards.   My allergist felt the 2nd vaccine  may have caused an inflammatory response and flared up my alpha gal symptoms.

A 57-year-old female patient received single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number: EL0142, exp date not reported), intramuscular (by injection once left arm, below shoulder blade in muscle) on 13Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (because of job). Medical history included two stroked from 1998 and 2005. Concomitant medication included oral donepezil started taking 3 months ago (Oct2020) for something having to do with muscles because of stroke. She takes a blood thinner, as she had 2 strokes; and takes muscle relaxers too. By 15Jan2021 (Friday morning) the patient was feeling bad, she couldn&#39;t go to work, she lost her taste and her smell, part of smell. Part of taste was back at the time of reporting, but she was tired and sleeping all the time (onset date reported as 15Jan2021). She saw her neurologist because she had 2 strokes, they referred her to Pfizer, as they said she may have already had COVID 19 with the symptoms she has, but as far as she knows, she didn&#39;t have it, she took a test with the center a month before giving the vaccine, she took the vaccine because of her job, because of the kind of job she has, and they wanted her to let Pfizer know she was sick. She doesn&#39;t know if she wanted to get the other dose, as she was not feeling well at all. She was laying down sleeping every day. Her doctor said to tell Pfizer what was going on. She still doesn&#39;t feel good the day of reporting. She still hasn&#39;t eaten a whole meal since 15Jan2021. She thinks she was probably getting better, but was getting better slowly, she has no taste, she was not able to eat, no smell at all, which was really not a good thing. She can&#39;t tell the outcome of no smell she thinks. She can&#39;t smell nothing at all. She can&#39;t smell what she was cooking. It was the same as taste, she thought that is probably why she can&#39;t eat, she can&#39;t taste what she was eating. Taste was improved, but not well enough for her, it is hard to explain, you know how you enjoy food, like how it tastes, and if you can&#39;t taste, you can&#39;t eat. She sleeps all day, she was up now, but is probably going to go to sleep, she feels tired and needs to lay down. She told her doctor she will call and see what Pfizer says, they will go from there. She doesn&#39;t know if she will have to go see if she has COVID 19, or what was going on.  No further investigation assessment was performed. The patient took a test a month before (results unknown). No taste was recovering (ongoing at the time of reporting) while outcome of other events was not recovered.

                                                Three hours after vaccine, I started to get body aches, stiff neck and fatigue. Starting around 12 after vaccine I developed chills, headache, fever and extreme weakness which lasted for 10&#43; hrs. The weakness improved slightly, but continued.  Starting 4 days after vaccine, I started to get stinging eyes, nose and mouth, increased nasal congestion and burning in my sinuses.   These symptoms are debilitating and are the same ones I had when I was at my sickest with Covid.  Whatever sense of smell or taste I had regained disappeared.  These symptoms  continues to the present.

Medicated with Benadryl 50 mg po and immediately to ED, registered right away, pt then c/o head and back itching, and taken into triage for assessment by triage nurse.   Per Hospital Note: Patient initially developed hives and itching with progression in symptoms to include shortness of breath and throat tightening. She reported feeling as though her tongue were swelling and having difficulty speaking and having difficulty swallowing. Concerns of impending loss of airway prompted administration of IV Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine which were unsuccessful and therefore emergent intubation was performed.   Patient apparently has had prior anaphylactoid reactions in the past including bee stings and shellfish.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EW0150; expiry: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Mar2021 01:30 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was a warehouse. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and no following prior vaccinations. Medical history included covid-19 in Nov2020. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 on 31Mar2021 and 12 hours later (on 01Apr2021), sore arm, fever, chills and headache. Got a swollen lymph node in armpit, same arm as injection left side, today tip of left ring finger turned white and numb. She thinks it was Reynauds phenomenon. The patient called and told nurse in her doctor&#39;s office and they said if it was painful, it could be a pain clot. It was painful at first, that lymph node started 24 hours later with a sharp pain, and then she just assumed it could be a lymph node. Swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and it was very sore. The nurse told the patient to call Pfizer. The patient was fine until the tip of her finger happened. The patient said If it was painful it could be a blood clot, would need an x ray and asked if did the shot cause this. The complete ring finger left hand, the patient looked it up and it said it could happen to her feet and she looked, and her feet were modeled red, blue it was bizarre. Never happened before. The patient was not happy about getting the vaccine, she already had covid in November of last year (2020). The patient wouldn&#39;t have called if it wasn&#39;t for her finger. Not just her feet, her hands got like this too. The patient didn&#39;t want to get the second shot. The patient asked if there was any information or mandate on timing information for the second dose, should she needed to postpone it. The patient asked if what was the efficacy after first dose as she felt like she was immune because she had the virus and now the vaccine. She was very hesitant to get the Covid 19 vaccine. She thinks her body created Covid 19 antibodies. A couple days ago she was very sick. The swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and could be a blood clot as far as she knows (in 2021). Even putting on deodorant she can tell it&#39;s there, it was very sore and there&#39;s a lump. Today (on 01Apr2021), she noticed the tip of her finger got white it was numb. She looked it up online and she thinks it was Reynaud&#39;s phenomenon. She has a picture if Pfizer needed it. The finger was on the same arm that she received her vaccine in. It was the ring finger on left hand. Once it started happening her finger felt funny and felt numb. She put her finger under warm water. She reported that the white color was maybe a third of the way down towards her knuckle. She was asking if this was normal or has this been reported. She had called her doctor today and spoke with the nurse who told her to call the CDC and report her symptoms. She needed her glasses trying to give her primary care doctor&#39;s phone number. The patient wanted to add that she has something like gout in her foot and on that side too, the left foot, it was pulsing and throbbing all night. She&#39;s had this pain in her left foot, she thinks its gout because it was all the symptoms of gout and she had it for a while, it hurts off and on but that night it was hurting and throbbing. She has not been diagnosed with gout in that left foot. She still has a headache but today she felt good except for her finger turning white and going numb. The lymph node in her armpit hurts. Her doctor&#39;s nurse told her if its painful to the touch it could be a blood clot so she was nervous about that. The tip of her finger was completely white and the rest of her hands were blue and red and white and yellow. She reported that her finger was back to normal now. She didn&#39;t want to get too inoculated since she also had the Covid 19 virus. The events did not require visit to emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events was unknown for thrombosis, Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon, erythema, cyanosis, illness, visual impairment, and gout while for the remaining events was recovering.

I called the Pfizer hotline, and they took down some information and then directed me to call the COVID hotline which resulted in pretty much the same.  As it was Christmas day and the weekend, I waited to contact my Primary Physician on 12/30/20.  She saw me immediately and sent me to a Specialist the next day to see Dr. for my hearing loss.  There I was given an audiological assessment where my right ear was found to have moderately severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.

                                                On the day of taking the vaccines had joint pains all over mainly involving the arms but they subsided. On the next day noticed redness and pain in the left eye. On 1/6/21 noticed diminished  vision and blurriness in the left eye. Called opthalmology  ED and was seen the next day on 1/7/2021 morning .  Was diagnosed with left uveitis. I was seen by the on call doctor.  There are many doctors involved in my care. My previous episodes of uveitis have been mostly in the right eye and the vision was not affected,  The doctors involved in my care are not sure if this was just a coincidence, was an exacerbation of the preexisting pathology or was something new.  I have asked to put the eye drops every hourly but the vision has not completely improved. I don&#39;t use the eye drops in the night and when I get up in the morning it is still very hard to read.  It is an unusual episode of uveitis as typically my left eye is not involved and I have never had this much diminished vision , I am supposed to put the drops every one hourly until 1/11/2021. I have informed my PCP, Rheumatologist, regular eye doctor.  I will inform my ID doctor Dr .

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

A 58-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 08Jan2021 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on left deltoid on 22Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient stated she got her first Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on 22Dec2020 and had no issues really with that one. And then she had second one on 08Jan2021. The first she got in her left deltoid and the second one she had on 08Jan2021, she had in her right deltoid. It&#39;s towards 8:30 in the morning roughly is when she had it. So, during the day went on 08Jan2021, she felt strange but not sick or anything like that. And the day went on to eat something and then came home. And then she&#39;d say at around 7:30 it hit her like with a ton of bricks. She was shaking so bad, she couldn&#39;t even hold anything. And then she was aching all the way from head to toe. And she was like she will get her tooth brush at least. So, she brushed her teeth and then all of a sudden her throat closed up on 08Jan2021 around 7:30 pm and she couldn&#39;t breathe. And she stated she was like &#34;oh my gosh and then it sort of opened up enough for me to scream for my husband, I yell for him to come and then it did it again, it closed up again. And when he came, I started hyperventilating because I was scared. And he calmed me down and rub my back and everything, and it went away. But it scared me. But the shaking lasted probably all through night maybe till 3 in the morning because I tried not to take anything and I probably took 2 Advil. And now I have residual like I am sill aching in my back. And it&#39;s weird, in morning I tasted the food, it tasted funny, like not the same but then at the end of the day I could taste food like normally. And then I had sort of a cough but not like I urge to cough but it was not like chronic. Not a lot but it&#39;s there like if you urge to cough, it doesn&#39;t happen a lot. &#34; The patient stated &#34;It started on 08Jan2021 around 7:30 pm, when my throat get bad. I have muscle soreness specially in my back and I don&#39;t know in the taste in the morning the food doesn&#39;t taste right but then like it&#39;s fine towards the afternoon. And I am still tired and a slight like cough. But the cough isn&#39;t really anything, if I get urge to cough. It&#39;s not all day, it&#39;s not chronic at all.&#34; The patient started to took Advil as a treatment and stated &#34;Well I started to because it was like 3:30 in the morning, or 2 or 3 in the morning I did take 2 Advil. And they helped with that pain.&#34; The outcome of the event taste abnormality was recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Post-Vaccination Paresthesia course:  About Sunday, 1/17/2021, I began to feel a numbing sensation spreading on the top of my head.  Since I was recovering from a severe allergic reaction to the Covid vaccine (numb, swollen lips, face, tongue), I initially thought it may be a recurrence.  However, by the morning of Tuesday, 1/19/2021, the numbness was complete from the tops of my eyebrows, over my scalp, my ears and down the center of my back to my buttocks. The numbness was bilateral. Alarmed, I went to the Emergency Room.  (I am a hospital pharmacist there.) The ER consulted Neurologist.  After MRI results, diagnosis was Post-Vaccination Paresthesia.  I was released from work by the ER through 1/21/2021.  The height of the paresthesia was 1/21/2021.  This included some auditory buzzing and mild blurred vision.  Today, 1/22/2021, I am beginning to regain feeling on my back and forehead. I estimate that I have regained about 50% feeling on my scalp.

I took 1 Benadryl and then another 15 minutes later, then drove home once rxn seemed to stabilize. Took 2 more Benadryl through the course of the evening as flushing stopped but still had throat discomfort and new headache. Also took Tylenol.  In AM, allergic symptoms were resolved,  but had significant arm pain (upper arm around site was very firm and warm to the touch), mild headache, moderate fatigue, and diarrhea. This continued for another 24 hours. Took Tylenol 3 times. Felt fine by Wednesday (2 days after vaccination).

On an unspecified date, the patient stated she was just at the hospital on Tuesday, in emergency room and they told me that she should report possible side effects from the Covid vaccine. The patient have the Third Nerve Palsy they think this might be connected to the vaccine they are not sure. When paraphrased the concern, consumer stated, &#34;They said I should just report that there was a reaction and they don&#39;t know if the Third Nerve Palsy is due to the vaccine or just something freak that I got.&#34;  When probed if patient was a Health Care Professional, consumer stated, &#34;I am not, I am a manager.&#34; The patient also added, &#34;Can I give you the Path Gram, on the 9th I had my first shot on the 12Jan, I developed Covid symptoms and on 18Jan I was tested positive, I was sick from all and finally got tested on the 18 and was Positive and finally stopped my fever at end, I think may be 01Feb, and they told me to get my second shot I got my second shot on 05Feb and on 15 I started having vision problems which was like little blurry and I went to my eye doctor and they didn&#39;t think anything else he said that it could be something from Covid like what they called continuing symptoms but not having Covid, I don&#39;t know what the terminology is or it could have been from vaccine then that was the 15, the following Monday I went to my Primary because my vision was double at this point in my right eye and they thought it might be sinus related I had a CT done came back normal they told me that they thought it was Third nerve palsy and I had a MRI in the meantime they told me to go back to my Ophthalmologist which I did on Tuesday as soon as he see my he sent me to emergency room cause he thought it was an Aneurysm, so I was in the Emergency room being examined in hospital in (withheld) when I spoke to the Doctor they said I should advise Pfizer that they can&#39;t prove but it&#39;s vaccine related.&#34; When the patient was asked about teatment: she stated, &#34;Well right now what they are doing is they had an had a MRI to be sure it was not Aneurysm or brain tumor which thank God came back negative and they did blood work so they are assuming it&#39;s third Nerve Palsy at this point but I have to see in 4 weeks it clears up or it could be Myasthenia gravis.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date unknown) via unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cholesterol, blood pressure (controlled blood pressure), hypothyroidism. Concomitant medications included TELMISARTAN (MICARDIS) for blood pressure and ATORVASTATIN (LIPITOR) for cholesterol; both on unspecified date. The patient was asking if she was able to get the 2nd dose of vaccine, since she was tested positive for Covid-19 (31Dec2020) after receiving 1st dose. The patient was asking information about missing 2nd dose and when can she get it and wanted to know if it was still okay to get the second dose. The patient asked if she needed to have a test negative for covid-19 prior to receiving 2nd dose. The patient experienced no sense of taste and actually realized it on 29Dec2020 that her food was not tasting good. The patient didn&#39;t notice her smell was gone until she was cooking the chicken curry, she even tested it out by spraying some perfume, she has no sense of smell on 30Dec2020. The patient informed that both her taste and smell returned 02Jan2021 but was not recovered completely. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included A1C: 6.4 on 12Dec2020, COVID-19 PCR test: positive on 31Dec2020, Covid-19 rapid test: positive on 31Dec2020. The patient informed that she had no positive test before the Covid-19 vaccine, she took Covid-19 antibody test in Apr2020 and it was negative. The outcome of the events tested positive for Covid-19 after receiving 1st dose was unknown, no sense of taste and smell was gone/no sense of smell was recovered with sequel on 02Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 at a single dose in left arm for COVID-19 protection. Medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed about 18 or 19 years ago), COVID-19 previously and did not have side effects like this (the patient had COVID 19 last month and did not feel this bad at all. Patient was asymptomatic). Concomitant medication included ongoing liraglutide (VICTOZA), ongoing insulin detemir (LEVEMIR), both started about 2 or 3 years ago for diabetes Type 2. She received the product vial workplace policy, so it was not specifically prescribed to her. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 02Jan2021, and starting on 06Jan2021, she started with headaches, and muscle spasms all over her abdomen and back. Headaches was reported as worsened. The headache will not go away and even with Tylenol it still lingers. Muscle spasms all over her abdomen and back was reported as worsened. Her eyes were weak and hurting, started on 08Jan2021. She was so tired, she wanted to sleep. The tiredness, started on 06Jan2021, and it is like in the morning she is okay, but then during the day she just got worse and worse and worse. Her sore throat starting 07Jan2021 night, and this morning it was really bad. Throat was very sore was reported as worsened. She received no other vaccines on the same day at the COVID vaccine. The patient was wondering if those are side effects of the vaccine, because the patient had COVID-19 previously and did not have side effects like this. This is a non-serious report. The outcome of event eyes being weak and hurting, and wanted to sleep was unknown, outcome of the other events was not resolved.

                                                About 2 min after receiving injection, I felt an intense flushing feeling all over, it felt as if my blood had turned into lava. About a minute after that I felt a &#34;tickle&#34; in my throat. The same sensation I felt  when I had my reaction to Gadolinium.  I tried to swallow, and it was a little difficult. I did NOT feel short of breath. I tried to calm down by doing slow concentrated breathing. I continued to take small sips of water to gauge my swallowing ability. After about 2-3 minutes, the flushing sensation subsided, and swallowing started to improve.  I had brought my Epinephrine pen with me.  About 1-2 min after the flushing sensation had subsided,, it came back and my swallowing ability got much worse, to the point I couldn&#39;t  swallow a small sip. I was breathing well, and did NOT feel short of breath, but gave myself my Epinephrine injection at that time. A Rapid Response was called at that time, my vitals signs taken, an IV inserted, 911 called. O2 sats were fine mid 90&#39;s, heart rate was mid 80&#39;s, BP was elevated,  I don&#39;t remember the exact systolic 170-180, but my diastolic was 116. It took the ambulance approximately 10-15 min to arrive. By the time the ambulance arrived, I was feeling close to my baseline and my BP was improving.  I was seen by the ER MD, and feeling fairly well, my throat still felt a tiny bit tight, but no difficulties swallowing.  The plan was to complete  treatment with IV steroids, Benadryl, and Pepcid, then be observed for a few more hours. This was approximately around 16:30. Not more than 5 min after MD left my room, I got the flushing feeling, and throat closing feeling again. While the medications were being prepared these  symptoms increased, ( I could still breath adequately and vital signs were still  OK.  It took about 10 minutes after meds were given for symptoms to begin to subside ( No epi given) I was observed until 21:30 then discharged. I am taking 50 mg daily x 3 days, 25mg Benadryl q 8hrs x 3 days, and 20mg Pepcid bid x 3 days. I feel fine , no further episodes

Two hours later, itching began on left leg and arms.  Noted red blotches to these areas.  Face began to feel very prickly and flushed, felt lower lip swelling and left eye began to feel funny.  Observed one hive to cheek.  Was able to take a Benadryl 25mg capsule within about 10-15 minutes after this developed.  Symptoms began to subside after this.  Felt  back to normal the next day.  Just moderate injection site pain for 1-2 days.

They wanted to keep me in the hospital but I told him I will follow up with my doctor on Monday, I did not want to stay on the floor with covid patients the test that they had ordered at the hospital were normal they did not order a CMP they only did a basic metabolic panel and that was normal, so I followed up with my doctor on Monday which was January 18th, and she ordered CMP and all the labs, when they threw my blood my liver enzymes were very elevated over the thousands LT ASG and the and others, then the doctor ordered a second set of blood works of CMP just to make sure it wasn&#39;t a fluke, they were even more elevated they were over 1,400.

I smell an medicinal or chemical smell.  Husband does not smell this so it is not an environmental odor.  Received a covid test on 02/22/2021 which was negative.  The altered sense of smell is still persisting.  Notified my doctor of it &amp; she asked that I notify the CDC as it may be a potential side effect from covid vaccine.

Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow&#39;s milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.

At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week.

This lasted for hours. Injection site pain only lasted about 24 hours.  Since then, I still have numbness on the right side top of head and intermittent EXTREME  tinnitus that interferes with my ability to concentrate, communicate and sleep. It comes and goes but the volume is beyond anything I have ever experienced. Then it goes away. The  right side of my head has stayed numb.   Will this go away? Should I get the 2nd dose or not?

                                                Received Covid vaccination/injection in right arm on 2/2/21. For the 1st four days, had occasional heart palpitations that lasted first 4 days then stopped--heart returned to normal with no more episodes. On 2/4/21, that night when I went to bed, I noticed a ringing in my left ear that became louder &amp; louder as the next several days went by.  I then noticed substantial hearing loss in my left ear.  Also 2 days later, I started having a dull ache around my left ear along with the loud, high pitched ringing. I kept thinking it would get better but a week before my next vaccine, I called my ENT  who monitors a small lesion &amp; hearing in my left middle ear.  I already had slight conductive hearing loss from this lesion and my last appointment/check up with her was in September 2020.  Dr. had me come to the hospital on 3/11/21 and a hearing test was performed and my left ear hearing had declined 15 decibels since my last hearing test in Sept 2020.  I was prescribed a Medrol Pak (steroids) for 1 week and returned on 3/23 for a 2nd hearing test with no improvement in my hearing or the loud ringing (tinnitus).  The Dr. told me that my hearing test showed damage to the left ear nerve.  I had also developed an inflamed, painful large sore under the left side of my tongue &amp; was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Dental Paste to use 2 x daily on the sore.  The Dr. ordered an MRI of my brain &amp; left ear to make sure the lesion in my ear had not grown.  I had the MRI on 3/29/21 and returned to my Dr. on 3/30/21 for results.  The lesion was stable, no growth.  I made my own decision and did not return for my 2nd Covid vaccine because it appears the 1st vaccine either inflamed the nerve in my ear or caused an auto immune response.

A 59-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 11Mar2021 15:30, as single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to antihistamine (unspecified) and sulfur drugs. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); omeprazole; and anastrozole, all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) received at age 59 years, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 18Feb2021 15:45, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. On 11Mar2021 at 15:45, 15 minutes after the second dose, the patient got lightheaded and dizzy. On the same day at 16:15, 45 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced nerve problems behind left eye, then nerve problems in face, then lips had nerve problems, then tongue was numb, and throat felt swollen. The patient reported the side effects on the hotline, and she was transferred to a nurse who told her to go to the emergency room immediately as she could be getting Bell&#39;s palsy from the vaccine. The events resulted to emergency room visit and hospitalization (unspecified date in Mar2021). Treatment for the events included unspecified IV. The patient was hooked up to an EKG and her blood was drawn for checking in Mar2021 (results were unknown). The patient was recovering from the events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient was previously healthy and got her second injection in the right arm on 1/25/2021.  She had severe weakness of the right arm starting the day after the immunization, headaches across the whole head, severe fatigue, confusion (brain fog), worsening depression, body aches, and these all progressed and got worse for at least 14 days.  She was unable to work any of those days due to weakness, confusion, and body aches.  She saw me in the clinic on March 2 as she was still feeling weak, tired, confused.  The clinic notes that day record:  &#34;On the next day, the 26th, she had severe pain and couldn&#39;t do much. Then she got super depressed and could not get out of bed for 2 weeks, had a lot of fatigue, body aches, and felt down. She tried going to the store one day and by the time she got done she could not get into her truck because she was in so much pain. That would have been about 2 weeks ago. She went back to work last week and was at work the whole week. She was told she does have leave time and that it did not cover the absence of work. She now needs new leave time forms completed.  Currently she is in a lot of pain. She has her endocrine appointment on March 15th. The pain is getting worse. The cold is really hard on her. She is barely able to move her right arm at the end of the day, and that is the arm where she had the COVID shot. She is having a lot more weakness. She can not even take one flight of stairs now because everything hurts her. This is a huge difference than before. She used to be able to do several flights, and she can&#39;t do that anymore.  She has also had vision changes. She has floaters but she is having a harder time focusing. She feels like no one would believe her, but she feels like this is all part of the reaction to COVID. She has a hard time focusing. She feels like she is going insane.&#34;

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 22Feb2021 11:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9266) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included arrhythmia, ear infection. Concomitant medication(s) included propranolol (PROPANOLOL [PROPRANOLOL]) taken for arrhythmia from Apr2020 to an unspecified stop date.  The patient previously took augmentin [amoxicillin;clavulanic acid] for ear pain and experienced rash on her elbows and palm and arm. Caller stated on Friday 05Mar2021, which was the 11th day after getting the Pfizer COVID Vaccine although she noticed symptoms on the 10th day 04Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine, states she noticed she had a hive rash on her palm and hand and elbows/rash on her palms, hands, elbows, and left hip and it was strange and her elbows were red and were itchy on the palms like red and itchy and she could see the rash starting on the left inside forearm; from there as the day wore on into the next day the rash became worse and more areas of the body were covered with the rash. States she made an appointment on that Monday morning with her HCP and had gone into the HCP office at that time; states on 08Mar2021, she was in distress with her throat starting to swell, her tongue started to swell/ her lips and tongue began to swell and she was covered with the hives and rash from head to toe. Caller states she was started on Prednisone at her HCP office and it was one of those dose packs; states she has no lot numbers to provide. Later on that evening she needed to go to the emergency room and she had become more severe and had a big dose of Prednisone at the emergency room and at that time the HCP there did believe she was having what is considered a post COVID vaccine delayed allergic reaction and hives; states she was in the emergency room early and was there past midnight and thinks she presented to the emergency room on 09Mar2021 and then most recent results she has of her paperwork were from 09Mar2021 to 10Mar2021; no further details provided by the caller. Caller states she was in the emergency room rolled over to the next day on the 09Mar in the evening around 10:30pm and concluded her ER visit on the 10Mar after 12:30. Caller states the HCP gave her the 40mg dose of Prednisone by injection and she has no lot number; states then at the ER, they gave her Prednisone 125mg IV and she has no lot number; they gave her hydroxyzine which is Atarax by IV and gave her Pepcid for her stomach at the same time; no lots for the Pepcid or Hydroxyzine. States the reason for her visit was allergic reaction, allergy hives, post covid delayed reaction. States she let them know at the site that before the vaccine she felt like she might have had an ear infection and was not taking anything no vitamins or anything like that and no Tylenol or anything for a week or so prior because she wanted nothing to be in her system other than the vaccine should anything happen. Had the vaccine that day, later on that afternoon contacted her HCP felt like she had ear infection, no fever but had fullness and some pain in her right ear. Saw her HCP at that time and took a look inside her ear and felt that she did have an ear infection without fever but was painful to the touch around her ear underneath her ear; prescribed Augmentin which she has taken before. Started taking one Augmentin pill on the 23rd in evening which would be Tues 23Feb2021 for the 1st dose, 500mg and dose supposed to take following the next day was to take two tablets one tablet twice per day which she did finish up around 10 days of that on 04Mar. The day before all this started with the rash she finished Augmentin, went to the HCP and two things happened; she was taking Augmentin and had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. States she had the rash on her elbows and palm and arm and she was like that coincides with the Pfizer vaccine but also was on Augmentin and had been on that before with no problems; thought it was either the vaccine or being on the Augmentin as the reason for the rash but narrowed it to the vaccine. States she ended up in the hospital that evening on Monday evening of 09Mar and it was something they had not seen but were prepared to see could happen and concluded the rash was from the vaccine. Caller states she went to see her immunologist at the conclusion of this event and she was still covered in hives and rash and did step her down on the Prednisone and prescribed her hydroxyzine and topical itch stuff. Caller states she has no lot numbers to provide for the topical stuff or the hydroxyzine or Prednisone. States the HCP concluded she could not receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine or any other vaccine that comes forward and she is not a candidate because of this reaction he can&#39;t safely say it would be ok to get a 2nd dose of the vaccine; states she can&#39;t receive a 2nd dose of any covid vaccine and it worried her because she has to be ok with having had the 1st dose of the vaccine and wants to know where she stands with that and what to do and she just doesn&#39;t know.
