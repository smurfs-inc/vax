                                                Angioedema; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (patient). A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1284, intramuscular in the right arm (also reported as right shoulder), first dose on 22Dec2020 00:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s relevant medical history included severe reaction to some animal dander and pollen, severe reactions to poison oak, possible drug induced reactions (unspecified) post C-section, mild rash with influenza vaccine this year (2020) (with no other hx of adverse reaction to a vaccine); had allergies to pollen, mold, some animals. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) and experienced rash. The patient had no covid prior vaccination nor was she tested post vaccination. Adverse event reported was angioedema on 24Dec2020 with outcome of recovering. Systems started appearing on 23Dec2020 evening with slight rash and fluid collection under right eye. Developed more rash on 24Dec2020. In the evening to early morning of 25Dec2020, symptoms worsened significantly. Rapid swelling to face occurred. Swelling was concentrated around eyes and cheeks the most. Both right and left side of the face and neck were affected. However, the right side face had a more pronounced reaction. MD ordered oral prednisone and Benadryl as treatment plan. Also, ordered episode-pen for a worst case scenario. Symptoms have been improving under treatment but still persist some. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse event start date was 24Dec2020 (as reported). The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event angioedema was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and temporal relationship.

About 9:30 my temp was 101.8F and they sent me home.  I just had the chills and fever.  I got home and developed a headache and around 1PM I started feeling really dizzy. The temperature did not subside and the next day I woke up and I couldn&#39;t function, I felt really dizzy I kept laying down and drinking water, I could not keep anything down my stomach did not feel well. I felt like I had to vomit. When I sat down in the toilet then my ears started ringing pretty bad all of a sudden I could not hear anything and I passed out in the toilet. My husband found me and tried to wake me up. After that I still feel dizzy. I did not have any appetite either. I could barely hold water. The next day I was not as dizzy but my stomach was still upset but I could hold some soup down but then started with diarrhea. Employee health kept calling me everyday and I did the the telehealth appt and I also had a little bit of a rash in my chest that appeared all of a sudden red like a streak. The dizziness I had for the first 4 days, diarrhea did not come until the 3rd day and I had it for 2 days and my temperature was back to normal on the 4th day. Everything started to get better (my stomach stopped feeling queezy) around the 4th day but still felt fatigued until about 12/29/2020.

A 40-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EJ1686, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm on 05Jan2021 at 15:00 to 05Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccine. Medical history included allergies, gallbladder problems, and had a little diarrhea. Concomitant medications included famotidine (PEPCID) for any potential allergic reaction, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for allergies, all are ongoing.  On 05Jan2021, the patient experienced left ear pain, left side of tongue is sore, pain that went down from her neck to her abdomen, injection pain on left arm, and on 06Jan2021, heaviness in one/left side of the body. The patient is most concerned with the pain she is experiencing. The patient was calling about Covid vaccine and got her first shot yesterday, on 05Jan2021, around 3pm. The patient stated that they had her stay about 30 minutes to make sure no major side effects. She had gone home and noticed that her tongue on left side was swollen and persisted into the evening and had a little diarrhea. She was experiencing left ear pain and decided to lay down. She stated that when she laid down noticed that she had pain that went down from her neck to abdomen, that when she woke up this morning that she had pressure on left side of her body and everything else had gotten better. She clarified that it was not swollen but sore. She stated that the diarrhea is not related to the Covid vaccine but is because she had gallbladder problems, her gallbladder was taken out before the vaccine. She stated not pressure just heavy and that the arm was regular injection pain. She stated that the shooting pain in ears is continuous like she was getting an ear infection. She stated that the symptoms are all on her left side, she clarified pressure on left side as heaviness. Stated that the allergies were diagnosed way before Covid vaccine.

                                                Anxiety; Headache; Seeing stars; Chest tightness; Hand tremor; SOB; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 40-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1284; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscularly on the left arm on 06Jan2021 (10:15) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included migraines; heart murmur with surgery; grand mal seizure that has resolved; and contrast dye allergy. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan and norethindrone [norethisterone]. The patient previously took phenytoin, iodine, terconazole, tramadol and cetirizine; and had allergies with these medications. On 06Jan2021 (10:15), the patient was seeing stars; had chest tightness; hand tremor; and shortness of breath (SOB). The patient was referred to the Urgent Care Clinic due to these events. On 06Jan2021 (12:30), at the Urgent Clare Clinic, the patient had anxiety and headache. The patient had received acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen and water as treatment for the events, &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was provided with education on managing anxiety. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021 for &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;headache&#39; and &#39;anxiety&#39;. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested post-vaccination.

                                                I received my shot at 12:15 at around 12:30 I started feeling more aware of my throat. My swallowing felt slightly off however, I was not aspirated secretions. My throat felt slightly thick and I had the sensation of wanting to clear my throat. I took a deep breath and I could breath.  It started to feel like my throat was getting sore or irritated. I felt slightly warmer. I decided to wait the full 30 minutes. When I went to stand had a moment of dizziness that passed but then I felt lightheadedness for about 2 hours after the injection. My ear felt like it was warm and there was slight pressure there. My throat continued to feel irritated and still feels lightly irritated after 4 days.  After about 3 hours it felt like something lifted and I felt better. That night I was really fatigued and tired. Maybe slightly cold. The next day felt fine except for the throat irritation that still persists today.  The side where I received the injection my arm, shoulder, and chest area felt affected for two days after receiving injection.

Around 8:57, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and the left side of my tongue went numb.  A little later the left side of my face felt weird and the inside of my ear felt numb. It wasn&#39;t tingling, but it felt like I had a Novacaine shot (like when you get a filling at the dentist).   My neck got stiff and I was really tired.  The symptoms lasted about 4 hours.    When I woke up this morning the left side of my face and jaw still do not feel 100%.  My left eye is watery.  I&#39;m very tired.

On the same day of 30Dec2020, about an hour after vaccination, patient got a very metallic taste in mouth, which lasted for about 12-18 hours and did sleep a lot, which she expected, but woke up about 11 at night and still had it and it was gone. Patient knew she slept longer than she normally does, went to bed at 1PM and slept until 11PM, which is not usually normal. Was up for about an hour or two and then went back to bed until 8AM of 31Dec2020. Patient was concern was if it was some type of reaction that it would mean she was going to have a stronger reaction to the second one and stated it was irritating but not a huge deal. Patient also felt tired and expected it as she worked five 12-hour shifts in a row. Patient was not sure if the metallic taste was connected to the COVID-19 vaccine.

Took 50mg prednisone 2 benadryl and albuterol inhaler.  Breathing got better and hives went away but still had swollen throat and took pepcid. Headache afterwards but that&#39;s typical of an allergic reaction.  I can&#39;t be sure it was from the vaccine or not but nothing I did yesterday would normally trigger that reaction

Moderate/Severe Fatigue set in around 3-6pm. Needed to nap from 4-5pm (extremely unsusual). Felt fine the next day. Moderate congestion in ears starting around the same time (6 hours after) and is persisting 30 hrs later. Feel like my ears will not pop and trying to yawn a lot. Also felt pretty bad sinus congestion starting at 7pm 12/21 (10 hrs after vaccine). Could not breathe through nostrils. Treated with sinus rinse and sudafed.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa antibiotics. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took meperidine (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies. Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sharp intermittent pain in her left jugular/carotid neck area and felt a little &#34;tipsy&#34;. This continued for about one day. Then last week (approximately 28Dec2020), her upper left molar started aching (toothache). This subsided within about 2 days. Then on 30Dec2020, she developed a severe earache, which began to subside within about 2 days. Around 31Dec2020 through 04Jan2021, she had intermittent numbness and tingling in her left jaw area. Last night (05Jan2021), she developed a sharp pain on the back side of her left neck area. She went to the doctor on 04Jan2021, and no treatment was prescribed. She began self-medicating with an old prescription of prednisone on the evening of 04Jan2020 due to being fearful of developing Bell&#39;s Palsy. Most of her symptoms have now improved after beginning the prednisone. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.

She is now having ringing in her ears, feeling lightheaded, hot, nauseaus, and &#34;I feel like I am in a cloud.&#34; She denies allergies or past hx of vaccine reactions. Denies hx of anaphylaxis. She denied any sob or chest pain. Employee was holding her head. She stated she had only had some coffee and juice today and was feeling hot. BP was taken and was 112/90 and she is not tachy and no resp distress observed. Patient was able to speak to me in full complete sentences initially.

                                                I was exposed to Covid in November. I tested negative twice but had nerve pain along the right side of my face when my son had tested positive.  Both times I got the vaccination the nerve pain in my face came back.  It was fairly painful the second time. The concern is that I had an inflammatory response similar to when I actually may have had Covid both times.  It went away within 48 hours and I have been done since.

Blood pressure became elevated much higher than baseline (Normal is 90/60). Paramedics came to evaluate and performed numerous 12-lead EKG&#39;s and noted multiple Premature Ventricular Contractions and transported me to the hospital where I was observed and consulted on from ED Physician. Later was evaluated by electrophysiology cardiologist with echocardiogram and EKG. Multiple physicians have advised not to get second vaccine.

                                                Within 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my left arm became very heavy and there was a tingling/neuro sensation in left wrist/hand. A pressure began in the  anterior of my throat which increased gradually. I sought treatment in our Urgent Care just after noon that same day. The Provider monitored my vitals which were good and administered liquid Pepcid. Said Provider chose not to give Benadryl as I had taken Zyrec that morning for my allergies. I was discharged from the Urgent Care and went back to work at 1245. At 1730 hours, I had a slight headache above my right eye and extreme right-sided jaw pain with tooth sensitivity. These lasted for only 10 minutes. At 1830, the anterior and bilateral portions of my throat began to feel &#34;prickly&#34; and I developed a wheeze. I used an albuterol inhaler to relieve the wheeze successfully. At this time I also developed an itchiness throughout my whole body, worse on left side than right side. I took 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. At 0300, I took another dose of 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. I also took an itch pill/antihistamine of my husband&#39;s which provided no relief. At 0800, I took 20 mg of Zyrtec. At 1030, I took 100mg of Benadryl. I continued to use Benadryl throughout the day, every 4-5 hours.  At 1800, I had a fullness in my throat, a tightness in my chest and my left shoulder blade felt almost numb.  I also had a hoarse voice which passed by the next morning. The chest tightness was intermittent over the next day or two.  On Friday, the itchiness had improved some but was still prominent. I continued to use Zyrtec and Benadryl throughout the day. My Primary Doctor called in Prednisone if needed. By Saturday morning, I felt MUCH better. Today is Sunday and I am no longer itching and I feel so much better today.

                                                Pfizer shot #1: She received the 1st COVID vaccine Pfizer on January 24th at 7:00 p.m..  The following day she noted a low-grade fever.  On January 26 she noted edema of her eyes and lips associated with facial redness and itching that she treated with Benadryl intermittently for the past 2.5 weeks.  She was seen in follow-up by her dermatologist who suspected an inflammatory reaction and prescribed anti-itch facial cream.  She was also seen by her primary care who suspected angioedema and prescribed her an EpiPen which she has not needed to use.   Pfizer shot #2: 2nd shot delayed due to snow. Above sx resolved before shot #2. She had her 2nd COVID injection February 20 at 3:50 p.m. About 1.5-2 hours later she noted onset of itching to her eyes and nipples along with itching of the skin in the locations of her usual eczema.  She noted that her lips and eyes were a little puffy but less severe swelling to the eyes and lips than the 1st injection.  She took 2 Benadryl shortly after onset of these symptoms.  This seemed to lessen symptoms about 50%. Later she noticed that her voice sounded raspy and hoarse and she had a sensation of swelling to her tongue and throat but she was able to swallow.  Her throat felt scratchy.  She denies having lightheadedness, urticaria or GI symptoms. She went to the ED and was treated with benadryl, solumedrol and pepcid, monitored for a few hours and then discharged on 60 mg prednisone X 3 days and advised to continue benadryl 50 mg Q6h. She takes zyrtec 10 mg BID for seasonal/perennial allergies.   Allergy history: She has a history of both idiopathic urticaria in early childhood and idiopathic angioedema in her early 20&#39;s. States she had extensive testing but the cause was never exposed. Took high dose prednisone for 4-5 months, angioedema resolved spontaneously and then flared again a few months later. Finally resolved with n additional 3 months of prednisone. She has both seasonal (feb-may) and perennial allergies to cat and dust, asthma and allergy to ampicillin--rash in childhood, and humira--fevers.

A 42-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) intramuscular, on 17Dec2020 04:15, single dose arm left  for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and penicillin allergy. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), butalbital, caffeine, paracetamol (FIORICET 50-40- 325mg), dexamethasone 4mg Inj., diclofenac (VOLTAREN 1% Gel), Magnesium, valsartan (VASOFLEX) (pending confirmation), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), losartan potassium. The patient was not pregnant and did not received any vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cephalosporin and experienced allergy. On 24Dec2020, the patient experienced pain left side of the face and migraine, and came to emergency room where apparently they diagnosed facial paralysis. The events resulted in emergency room visit/ urgent care where the patient was administered dexamethasone 4mg Inj, Medrol dose pack, Vit B12 500mcg, and Fioricet 50-325-40. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior or since the vaccination. The events were assessed by the nurse as non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovering at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

                                                While patient was receiving her second dose of the Pfizer brand Covid-19 vaccination (at 14:50), she mentioned to me that she had a sustained local reaction to her first dose.  Her arm had a hard, red, hot spot for approximately a week.  At this time I told her we would like her to stay under observation for 30  Min instead of the normal 15 min. At approximately 25 min post vaccination, the pt reported the following: &#34;arm felt heavy, both arms did, but more so the affected arm, instant headache, sore neck, vision went fuzzy, breathing wasn&#39;t difficult but felt labored, throat felt like it was closing/congested, rash on the inside of the affected arm&#34;.    Pt stated that her heart felt like it was &#34;pounding&#34;.    VS:  162/96, 99% RA, HR in the 70&#39;s.    Patient was administered 50ml IM diphenhydramine and monitored for 90 minutes in the clinic area.  Dr. was consulted and also spoke with the pt, advising her to continue with OTC diphenhydramine once at home.     The symptoms resolved after approximately 40 minutes.  By 17:00 the patient was deemed stable to go home with the instructions to go immediately to ED should any further Sx present.  It was verified that she did not live alone and would have someone with her that could assist.    Pt was subsequently followed up with a phone call on the next day by RN who relayed that she was very tired, but no other complications.

However, all of these sensations went away on their own within five minutes of onset, without any intervention.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

By day 5 (27Dec2020) made its way to left side. Twitching of face when do certain movements. Her Dr gave her Prednisone and she took 50 mg for 4 days and stopped because she couldn&#39;t differentiate the tingling in hands and feet from shot or from that. Still brain zaps, newest issue sharp pain jolt behind eyes, left one in particular so bad she screamed and the nerves went all the way to finger tips. Her hand eye coordination was off as well and she wasn&#39;t able to be accurate on keyboard and her cursive was off. Whole body still weak, eyes hurt. Head a lot better than a day ago but still having buzzing and twitching. Today was day 18.

The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse events included CT/MRI/Optic Nerve Scan/Pain Shot/Meds for Zaps. The events were non-serious per the reporter. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 28Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for prednisone was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all these reported serious events might not be fully excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                About 20 min after receiving my Covid 19 vaccine, I left Hospital and began to feel numb in my throat, my lower face, and the tops of my shoulders. I had reduced sensation, but also felt as though I had no muscle control with movement. Examples of this are when I tried to flex my head forward as if in a nodding motion, or to elevate my shoulders like a shrug, or clench my jaw like when chewing. These were all extremely difficult and I felt as though I had no awareness of if I was even moving these parts of my body whatsoever when I tried to voluntarily do so. It was very strange and also upsetting. I also began to have blurred vision; it was difficult to focus or see properly, such as when you visit the eye doctor and they dilate your pupils and everything seems blurry and out of focus for a period of time afterwards. This all lasted for about exactly 1 hour post.  I did not seek medical attention for this as it did not worsen. I never had any difficulty breathing. It then completely went away.

Ibuprofen and caffeine. Day 7 I went to get a haircut thinking the migraines may be caused by heavy long hair. Day 8 extremely painful migraine, can?t open eyes as light made it worse, nausea, vomiting. Called my PCP, they recommended going to urgent care after I vomited. I couldn?t get a ride so I took ibuprofen, Tylenol, and hydroxyzine to help me sleep until it?s gone.

                                                I am going to describe all my symptoms so far in detail.  Shortly after the shot in the medical observation area I experienced mild nausea that went away for the rest of the day.  About an hour after the injection, I experienced nasal drainage in the back of my throat that lasted about 30 minutes.  3 hours after my shot, the arm pain at injection site began, followed by 6 hours later moderate to extreme fatigue that did not cause me to be sleepy or drowsy--simply fatigued.  I had enhanced sense of taste and smell.  On Wednesday, 1/27 I woke up seeming okay and tried to work at my computer from home.  I experienced light-headed and dizziness, and a headache that feels like pressure, and sinus pressure at the bridge of my nose.  I had to disengage from work.  After lunch around 2 PM I had extreme fatigue and had to lie down in bed the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I have moderate nausea that comes in goes in waves.  This morning, Wednesday, 1/28 I woke up with nausea and ate breakfast with a heightened sense of smell and taste.  I logged into work and the lightheadedness and dizziness began again (also sort of in waves, though the headache is more pervasive and less wave-like than the nausea), along with waves of moderate nausea and headache.  The arm pain at the sight of injection has significantly abated from a punch to mild pain.  The &#34;sinus&#34; or sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose seems only a fraction improved.  The headache or pressure has moved from the back of my head to the right side of my head.  I had no body aches, but this morning has mild to moderate body aches this morning in my legs and hip bones.   1/29 I woke up with 20%-30% reduced symptoms of nausea and headache, but the dizziness and sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose remain the same.  I still have enhanced taste and smell (a sensory plus it&#39;s not a distorted or odd enhancement, simply the same flavors and tastes enhanced).  The ache that began yesterday in my lower body, my legs still ache, though it feels more like numbness than an ache.  I tried doing some stretches which felt good, but my legs still feel the same after stretching.  Pain at the site of injection is reduced 90%. There are some strawberries sitting next to me, and I can smell them acutely. Yesterday, 1/30, I woke up with mild nausea and fatigue.  This nausea dissipated in the morning, but I felt too fatigued to do Pilates.  The waves of dizziness and waves of nausea returned mid-day and I had a low-grade fever of 99.4 (my temp. Tends to run slightly lower than 98.6, as I take it regularly).  The pain/pressure in the bridge of my nose has reduced 30%, but still remains.  The ache or numbness in my thighs remains the same. This morning, 1/31, my temp is normal at 98.6, but I have mild waves of nausea and moderate waves of dizziness.  The pain/pressure on my nose remains the same as yesterday.  I have some mild ear pressure.  My thigh weakness remains the same.  I am too fatigued to attempt Pilates.  Acute sense of smell and taste remains the same.  The headaches or pressure also seem improved since Saturday 1/30. Monday, 02/01 - ah back to work I woke up with moderate nausea and pretty intense body fatigue and muscle aches in my lower body.  I had to work, and I just wanted to crawl back into bed.  I worked anyway, also the fatigue tends to worsen mid-day.  The dizziness is moderate in waves, and the headache is still mild, along with that mild sinus pressure on my nose.  I was in bed after dinner but could have rested all day.  02/02 I awoke with a very mild nausea! The intense fatigue (which worsened several days past my vaccine) was mild. I was ready to attempt my regular Pilates routine, and I did it!  My muscle aches are mild to moderate (also, why are my muscle aches mostly confined to my thighs and hips I do have vague pain at the injection site, but its vague, and I use my whole body in Pilates) dizziness waves are back as I sit here typing and get ready to login online to my job staring at the computer screen is jarring to the dizziness waves and reminds me of the mild headache.  This is the best I&#39;ve felt since 1/27 through mid-day I tend to worsen and dizziness that is moderate is disturbing.  The heightened sense of taste and smell also seems to have waned a bit in the past two days, back to what I was per usual? I tend to have an acute sense of smell and taste.  *I would like it noted in light of new evidence that many people that have had COVID are experiencing intense reactions to the first dose that it is quite likely that I had COVID back in March when my learning center (I work with students age 4-adult, some of which are learning disabled and have autism) emergency closed because a client called to say she was positive for COVID.  I had taken her sons temperature the day before.  Me, and my two co-workers on my management team were also feeling sick.  I had a sore throat and chest pains for approx. a month, but at the time COVID testing was not widely available.  Since then, My co-worker has tested positive twice for the antibodies, and her husband, who was also sick at the same time, has tested negative twice.  I tested negative once for the antibodies, though given my job, my commute on the subway during rush hour my co-workers positivity, and my intense reaction to the first dose I most likely had COVID.  My boyfriend&#39;s roommate recently also revealed that he is positive to the antibodies, and he was literally sneezing and coughing in the same room with us this past summer and spring.    I think a 2nd dose of the same vaccine will cause fainting and vomiting, and the need for two weeks off of my work. This dizziness is alarming.  I&#39;m also thinking not having antibodies means nothing in terms of my body and immune system recognizing the vaccine and the virus, making me more ill than when and if I actually had COVID in March or last year.

Concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter felt worried about the patient (partner) that had facial paralysis and asked if they could administer the second dose of the vaccine of COVID-19 from Pfizer. The paralysis it was previous from the fist dose of the vaccine, a consequences of the stress, the partner had 42 years. The reporter considered that the event was non-serious. As of 15Jan2021, it was reported that the patient experienced facial paralysis caused by stress a couple of years ago and then again after the vaccination (24Dec2020). The patient also experienced pain in face on 24Dec2020. The patient underwent MRI on an unspecified date. Treatment was given for the events facial paralysis and pain in face (Anti-inflamatories).

I saw the cardiologist who believed it to be sinus tackycardia as a result as an AE to  vaccine.  Felt as if my face and lips were swelling  so I took benedry and laid down again and the next morning  when I woke up and my face and lips were super swollen.  But by the 3rd day the symptoms began to subside a little.  By the 24th my HR had balanced out and I only had residual swelling around the eye area.

When I woke up I had numbness and weakness in the right of my tongue which I quickly realized included the right portion of my face. Included tongue was numb and I couldn&#39;t move it. An Er trip and CT scan confirmed it was Bells Palsy. Today,  My symptoms continue. Top of my head all the way to the  way to bottom of neck is experiencing paralysis.  Can move tongue now and it&#39;s partly numb but it&#39;s cooperating a bit more now. Nerve pain has worsened all over all the right side of face. Feels like someone  has kicked  face and I have a deep bruise.  It&#39;s a deep ache. Nothing will take away the ache away. My eye doesn&#39;t lubricate like it should. So I have to either manually close it and wet it manually or tape it closed.

By the time I got back into my house, I had tunnel vision and could not see directly in front of me. I went to lay down, but ran into a piece of furniture because I was so disoriented and hit my shin on it. I collapsed on my bed. I stayed there for  few hours and then I was ok. I had severe, flu-like symptoms for most of the day - fever, chills, low energy, joint pain (specifically back and hip) - that waxed and waned. I finally felt almost back to normal approximately 50 hours after the injection.

                                                I had had minor intermittent teeth pain off and on for several weeks. With in a day of getting the vaccine the pain began increasing to the whole left side of my face and neck and increasing in intensity. I was unable to sleep 12/24 and 12/25 and ended up going to urgent care on 12/26. Despite not having sinus fullness/drainage they diagnosed it a sinus infection and gave me antibiotics. At the end of the 5 day course my symptoms had improved some but were not gone and I was still requiring frequent Tylenol for pain so the course of antibiotics were extended. I do not know if this was caused by the vaccine, but it coincided with the vaccine.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

A 43-year-old female patient received one dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via unspecified route single dose for protection from COVID-19 2 o&#39; clock or 3 yesterday (09Jan2020), at 43-year-old. Medical history included: multiple sclerosis. Concomitant medication included: sertraline 50 mg once daily at night; antidepressant (unspecified). The patient previously took glatiramer acetate (COPAXONE) once for multiple sclerosis and amantadine, was allergic to both. The patient didn&#39;t notice soreness on the side of her face, was probably from the vaccine started yesterday (09Jan2020). The patient was doing fine but then noticing was getting swelling in her lymph nodes on the right side. The patient did not notice the swelling, but she noticed the discomfort first last night (09Jan2020), &#39;9th, 10 pm&#39; (not clarified further). The patient thought that it was a &#39;pimple&#39; (not further clarified) there. And then later today (10Jan2020), or just maybe an hour ago, when she felt that on her neck, she found lymph nodes swollen. So far, no treatment was taken. No lab work done. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was resolved.

                                                Around 11:30pm 1/25, I muttered &#34;I don&#39;t feel good,&#34; which reminded me of being a child getting sick. within 30 minutes of then end escalating over the next hour, I had a severe headache, bilateral, occipital, pressure in entire head and neck. The headache as also in my eyes and in my ears.  Back was also painful - not as bad as neck, but i can&#39;t explain how horribly a hope a massage could fix me.  There was no comfortable position to alleviate any of that.  I also got the chills, constantly, suddenly switching from shivering cold to so hot i needed to take blankets off - but soon as i took the blankets off I&#39;d be freezing cold again. I was also super nauseous, though i didn&#39;t vomit. I pretty much couldn&#39;t get out of bed much for 24-36 hours. During that time, i was unable to sleep as well, i think mostly due to the chills, constantly having to move about to keep warm or cool off, but not sure.      I did take acetaminophen around 10pm 1/26 (36 hours after injection)- i felt like I knew you&#39;re not supposed to, but I couldn&#39;t take it any more and it might have less anti-inflammatory impact than ibuprofen.  It dulled the pains some, but didn&#39;t make it stop. the chills and nausea mostly stopped and was able to sleep more the second night, last night.       I&#39;m now up and trying to work today (1/27). Head still has pressure headache throughout. Neck is still sore, like a pressure headache. I feel generally foggy and heavy.

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, my throat started feeling really thick - hard to breathe. Felt like I was wheezing. Super shaky and dizzy. I gave myself my epi-pen. I notified them and they took me to ER - IV - Benadryl and Solumedrol . I got really shaky for about an hour afterwards and then they discharged me. It cleared up my throat issues. within 4 days, I had significant shortness of breath again and I was directed to ER Gave me evaluated me for a pulmonary embolism - I did not have one. They gave me Solumedrol again. They gave me a prednisone taper. And then a week after that - or two weeks after - the shortness of breath returned  - Dr had me go to ER room again - They gave me another prednisone taper which I&#39;m still on and I have significant fatigue still and 24/7 out of breath still. Currently: Flonase 50 mg - twice a day - Admerdiscus 100 mg  - twice a day

                                                heart rate jumped up; thought she was going to pass out; eyes were blurry; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 43-year-old female consumer received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at single dose via an unspecified route of administration on left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Relevant medical history included autoimmune issues diagnosed in 2006-2007. Concomitant medications were not reported. After 4 days from vaccination on 14Feb2021 the patient experienced blurred vision, increased heart rate, and feeling that she will pass out (as such) . She went to the Emergency Room and they did two EKGs, two COVID tests, and blood work to check the enzymes in her blood for her cardiac muscle, but there was no reason, nothing they could find about why her heart rate spiked. Patient also reported that her heart rate went up from about 03:00PM up thru midnight last night, and was still not down completely, it was a little erratic, but it was better than it was. She was prescribed treatment at the hospital to bring her heart rate down, but they didn&#39;t want to give her more and risk lowering her blood pressure. Patient was monitored through the night, and she was supposed to see a cardiologist there but they didn&#39;t show up, so she put a phone call in to hers. She was admitted to the hospital overnight. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date.

A 43-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 06:30 (at the age of 43-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 (with taste and smell loss). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylactic reaction on 16Jan2021 at 20:00 and itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss on an unspecified date. The patient reported that all the progress she made with taste and smell, disappeared after the vaccine and was actually worse than when she got COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild anaphylactic reaction, which included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The clinical outcome of mild anaphylactic reaction was not recovered and of itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

On the 29th I was given a COVID-19 test which came back positive. I noticed when I lay flat I cough alot but when I prop myself up I dont.

A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included cutaneous t-cell lymphoma from 2017 and ongoing, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing thyroid, covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date not ongoing (lasted about 1-1.5 months; she did not have any breathing problems) and blood cancer. Concomitant medication included bexarotene ongoing for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rosuvastatin ongoing for cholesterol, levothyroxine ongoing for thyriod. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID 19: positive in Nov2020, found out tested positive around holiday. Clinical course: onset about 26 hours after administered the first dose; onset as soon as she got back to work next day: 06Jan2021. The side effects were at their worst for at least 24-48 hours. Further described as all side effects occurred only on left side of her body: whole left side of face swelled up on 06Jan2021; left eye turned red on 06Jan2021; whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb on 05Jan2021; eye went black/left eye looked bruised on 05Jan2021; pressure in head on 06Jan2021; felt like someone squeezing her eyeball out on 06Jan2021, within the first 24-48 hours, her &#39;left leg went numb&#39;. She called to talk to physician and nurse who advised her to take Benadryl; which she did take and the Benadryl stopped the side effects; but she could not take a lot of Benadryl or anything because she was at work. She stayed at work because at least there were healthcare professionals, adults in case she passed out; at home she has 7 young children and is also raising her grandchild. The side effects did not completely go away. The arm thing was normal; The next day she was at work and had the swelling on left side of face; blackness around the eyes; arriving home she had headaches on 07Jan2021 and then her leg went numb for like 20 mins; the whole left side of her body went numb including even her vagina; left side of her body was so numb and weird and tingly feeling that she started panicking because she was driving on 06Jan2021. She calmed herself down thinking it&#39;s only the left side; you can drive with your right side to get home and be fine. It was more like left side of her body was asleep, tingling, she has never had that happen before. Everything else like the headache, flu feeling was about 48 hours later (on 07Jan2021). She had COVID already back in Nov2020 for about 1-1.5 months; the next side effects she had were like the COVID symptoms she had, like the chills and everything on 06Jan2021. She had the lethargic feeling again, her head was hurting, she felt extremely weak on 06Jan2021. Patient also felt nausea on 06Jan2021, Dizzy on 08Jan2021. Another doctor said it sounded like the side effects she experienced with the vaccine sounded like allergic reaction or Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient was asking the doctor if she could get like an Epi-pen or prescription Benadryl or something because she is afraid to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and not have something to respond to side effects with. The outcome of event whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb was recovered on 07Jan2021, for headaches was recovering, chills and nausea was recovered on 08Jan2021. Outcome of other events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140), intramuscularly on the arm on 19Dec2020 11:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tachycardia and stroke from 2019 and diabetes mellitus diagnosed in summer of 2020 and ongoing. Family medical history included father had type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medication included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) for diabetes. The patient previously took regular flu shot and had body aches; it did not happen at the year of report but in years past she did have it. The patient took the COVID vaccine for precaution as she was a healthcare worker/paramedic and stated there was no prescriber. She received the vaccination at a health department facility, not a military facility. She had no previous immunizations and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date as COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Dec2020 and after nine days, she tested positive for COVID-19 on 30Dec2020 and had an inpatient hospital stay. She mentioned she was so happy that she did not have any symptoms for those days. She stated that she got the shot on the 19th and later that evening was when she started having symptoms. She tried to sleep and it woke her up, she felt sleepy, tired and experienced headache on 19Dec2020 20:00 to 21:00. On 28Dec2020 23:00, she had an increased cough. She initially had increased cough from wearing mask and was having post nasal drip, then she got wet cough and that was when she decided to get tested. She went back and forth on dates; stated she was confused with the dates because of being in the hospital, it had been a while and the dates were all meshing in together. Her specimen was collected and they did the test on 29Dec2020 then found out that she tested positive for COVID virus with a COVID test nasal swab on 30Dec2020 17:30. She mentioned she lost weight after she got COVID, had no sense of taste or smell on unspecified dates. She did not know if it was related to her thyroid but she started losing hair and her heart rate started increasing on Monday, so they took her off all her meds and said the COVID was doing crazy things to the body. She had to go on Carvedilol for the sinus tachycardia and had high blood pressure now. This was all new after she tested positive. She has had bouts of tachycardia before and did have a heart monitor as she had a stroke last year. So those have never been persistent or symptomatic. If she did have a high heart rate, it always went down. This one was symptomatic. She did fine the whole week after the shot, just had that little bit of sleepiness, was tired, and had a headache. The patient reported near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism on 08Jan2021 14:30 to 15:00, which required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 10Jan2021 (2 days). ER or physician&#39;s office was required. She never went to the ER for the vaccination, it was just for the near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism that she went and was then admitted to hospital. She just got out of the hospital the day before report (10Jan2021), was there for two days and was still recovering. She was supposed to receive her second vaccination on the day of report however her doctor did not know if she should get the second dose due to double antibodies. She did not ask if she still had the virus or it went away. She has not been to work in two weeks. Outcome of the events tested positive for COVID virus was not recovered; near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism was recovered with sequel; sleepy, tired and headache was recovering; while the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20&#39;s, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn&#39;t have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours. She confirmed this product was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date on it. She clarified she also had been taking the generic version of TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH, it was the Up and Up Brand acetaminophen (Lot#: P122699, Expiry Date: Nov2022) gel caps, 500mg. COVID-19 rapid test was negative on 23Feb2021; COVID-19 PCR test on 23Feb2021 was unknown results. Patient asked if there was a hotline she can call or an information number where she can talk to somebody about her symptoms. She also reported this to her doctor but the doctor made it clear since it was a private practice, they had limited information. The doctor did take down similar information, she just did not know if there was any further information or a hotline she could call. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                BELLS PALSY  January 3, 2021- Slight numbness in tongue and food tasted different, pounding frontal headache at night and took Tylenol 500 mg for headache relief. January 4, 2021- The slight numbness in tongue continued and my face started to feel a little different too. I had headaches on and off throughout the day and evening. January 5, 2021- Woke up to get ready for work and noticed that my right eyelid was a little swollen and the right side of my mouth looked different. I arrived at work and my right eye was not closing properly and I was having difficulty blinking. I left work an hour later and went to ER to seek treatment. I was prescribed Prednisone and Valacyclovir for a seven day course.  The first time I had Bells Palsy was in 1997 when I was 22 years old.

                                                Started to have blurry vision with my eyeglasses on then got worst in the afternoon, which I took my glasses off to avoid straining my eye to focus on my computer screen and paperwork.  Vision was more blurry without my glasses but could not wear my glasses which made the blurriness worst.  Had pressure behind my eyes with a mild headache along with sensitivity to light.  The next day 11/05/2021, had my eyes checked by the eye doctor who indicated that everything was normal, eye pressure and response to light.  He did put a numbing eye drop in my eye that made the eye pressure relieve for a couple hours but when that wore off, I could feel the pressure behind my eyes.  On 11/06/2021, my eye and vision were back to normal

It was reported after 30 minutes.  25 mg of Benadryl was given PO at 2:35. I started to develop a cough and was clearing my throat but had no difficulty breathing. At 3:05 another 25mg of Benadryl po was given. I was monitored until 4:30 PM. I was sent home. By 630 the sensation had started to increase again. I took 25 mg of Benadryl PO again. By 7 PM I was not having any relief so I spoke with my physician and he advised me to take 25 mg of Benadryl PO and the first row of a steroid dose pack. By midnight the symptoms had started to reoccur. I took another 50 mg of Benadryl. I finished the medrol dose pack on Wednesday, January 13th but still have the raw sensation on my tongue.

                                                About 25 min after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a little tingling on my lips and my cheeks and my face felt heavy. I looked myself in the mirror, my face, cheeks and neck became very red like beet red and warm to the touch. I returned to the vaccine site and they observed me but the symptoms worsened, my eyes started getting puffy/ my cheeks started getting purple instead of red, and they sent me to the ER. At the ER they continued to monitor me and gave me IV Benadryl and IV Pepcid and IV steroids and said I had a delayed case of hives. Once I had all the IV medication the swelling went down and the hives on my arms and my back went away, the redness in my face and neck stayed until next day and I noticed after taking a warm shower the next day the redness returned on other parts of my body. I took a Benadryl. About after 2 days it was all resolved.

                                                COVID-19 pneumonia; COVID-19 pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) from a Pfizer-sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs). A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EK570), via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she felt yucky afterwards on 23Dec2020, experienced shortness of breath on exertion and coughing on 26Dec2020; chills, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, body aches, fever on 28Dec2020; loss of taste, loss of smell and COVID-19 pneumonia on 07Jan2021.  All the events were reported as being medically significant.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 29Dec2020.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia and included: started on bronchodilator, cough elixir, steroids and azithromycin (ZITHROMAX).  The outcome of muscle pain, body aches and COVID-19 pneumonia was recovering and of loss of taste and loss of smell was not recovered.  The causality of the suspect vaccine to the events was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

                                                ringing in the ears; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as one injection to left arm) on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy. Concomitant medication included prednisolone acetate (PREDNISOLONE ACETATE, Manufacturer: Pacific Pharma. NDC: 60758119-05, Lot: E88990, Exp. date: Feb2023) 1%, four eyedrops a day until she is out, 7 days at most or a week for allergy. The nurse called as a patient about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, which she received on 16Dec and had a headache - only a slight headache, the day after and ringing in her ears that has not gone away. She says it was her first injection of the vaccine. The patient says she was given the vaccine through her work, and says she had a headache that evening and then a slight headache the next day. She says that the ringing in the ear, she noticed the next day in the morning. She says it is hard to tell if the ringing is just one ear or not, the ringing is staying about the same, and is more in her right ear. She says she has not had treatment for either the headache or the ringing in her ears, and the headache improved on its own. She had no new medications and didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines when she got this one. She says that she went to the eye doctor in the past week and he started her on eye drops, she has never been on prednisone for allergies, and for her eyes he gave her prednisone drops and allergy drops. She says she started that medication on the evening she got it, Monday 21Dec. She would like to know if there could be some type of allergy, she doesn&#39;t know if she should take the second dose of the vaccine. She says she doesn&#39;t know if there is something she should do for the ringing in her ears, like a common treatment or anything, or if others have been reporting this. She says she saw on the website that one side effect said ringing in ears, but she isn&#39;t sure if the website was either of those provided by call handler for further information. The outcome of the events slight headache was resolving while ringing in the ears had not resolved.

A 46-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK5730, Expiration Date Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in her right deltoid on 19Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Crohn&#39;s disease from 2007/ diagnosed at 33 years old. There were no other concomitant drugs. The doctor who received the COVID vaccine stated that she must had been exposed to the virus prior to receiving the vaccine because she became symptomatic 48 hours after getting the vaccine. She noted that on Pfizer website recommended that a person not get the vaccine until 6 weeks after active infection but she of course did not know she had been exposed and when her second dose was due, she would not be 6 weeks after active infections. The vaccine was received on 19Dec2020 and she tested positive on 22Dec2020. The only symptoms she had experienced after testing positive are nasal congestion and loss of smell and they started on 21Dec2020 in the morning. She had had no worsening of her Crohn&#39;s disease. The only testing she had had done was the PCR testing for COVID. No treatments for the symptoms at this point. The outcome of the events tested positive COVID was not recovered, while for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal role of BNT162B2 would seem unlikely based on the temporal gap between the vaccination therapy and the event onset.

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

                                                The day after I received a vaccine, I had higher than usual blood pressure and pulse rate. I also had a muscle pain in the arm and I felt tired during the day and in the evening. My pulse rate continues to be high. My pulse rate was 100 on the second day and for number of days it is around 95. Today it was 95 most of the day. I have not been regularly checking my pulse rate before, but based on what I found in some information in my medical record, it is most likely around 75. I notice the higher pulse rate through pulsation in the chest and temples. I have a hard time concentrating on work and reading things on the screen.

Went to ER and they first thought I had wax in it - couldn&#39;t hear after they flushed it with warm water. Didn&#39;t change anything . Did a brain MRI - and that was negative. Did some bloodwork - and it all came back okay. After all that - 6 hrs there: Prednisone - 60 mg a day for 10 days. After 24 hours of taking that my hearing was back -  there was huge improvement. I Still have very loud ringing in my ear. Constant buzz in my ear. Had a hearing test to test and it looks pretty good. Going back in three months for hearing test.

Laid my head down on my arms on the table. Do not remember getting up, but remember walking through the kitchen in front of the refrigerator, reaching up to feel my pulse, felt two beats which were too far apart and thought to myself, &#34;I&#39;m going to faint&#34;. Apparently I was able to walk about 6 feet further, but I don&#39;t remember it. I don&#39;t know what time I fainted, but I think I must have fallen. I woke up sometime after 7, disoriented and my head hurt, lying on the kitchen floor. My husband came to my side after I called out to him about 5 times. I was drenched in sweat and very weak.

Was taken for evaluation. Was given IV NS (I think 1000mls). Labwork was drawn. CXR, CT, and EKG.

EKG normal sinus rhythm, but showed anteroseptal infarct of unknown age, confirmed by cardiologist who read the EKG. Also seen by my PCP at 1430, he checked my ears, as they had been hurting as well, said they were clear. Advised alternating tylenol and ibuprofen Q4-6H.

                                                sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss worse on one side; tinnitus; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 46-years-old female patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular into right arm on 05Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization. Time the vaccination was reported as 10:00-10:30. Medical history included food and environmental allergies. The patient had a history of autoimmune antibodies to thyroid but with normal thyroid numbers. No medication was needed, but autoimmune antibodies was found in the past. She had a propensity for autoimmune disease, it was just not active. She was diagnosed the first time she found auto antibodies 12 years before 19Jan2021 (2009) and checks her thyroid yearly and they had been normal. She still had antibodies, but thyroid hormone levels are normal without intervention. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Historical vaccine included Pneumovax 30 days before getting the COVID vaccine (06Dec2020, 46-years-old). Her pneumonia titers were low. Historical vaccine also included flu shot, she felt sick but like everyone else, she did not consider that abnormal. She thought most people felt kind of down and it did not have long term effects. It did not require any doctor visits. She did not have a rash or anaphylaxis. The patient was a physician and well versed in terms of symptoms. By evening of 05Jan2021, she developed tinnitus, which she had never had and has been there ever since. She was on day 13 post vaccine and still having bilaterally, every day and it never went away. She had a physician visit on 12Jan2021 and hearing test performed that day. They did find sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss worse on one side, her test confirmed bilateral hearing loss at 11:00 on 12Jan2021. It was mild so far in the high frequency ranges. So, they gave option to start 14 day course of high dose steroids with steroid injections into the ear, because in some cases of acute hearing loss, it can curb or reduce it. She decided to do that. Now she was going to be on steroids. She would be temporarily immunosuppressed. She did not know if that will affect the vaccine. She had not decided if she will get second shot. It is due next week, but she was a little nervous. She was considering delaying the booster a couple months out to see if more information develops. She provided her weight as between 175 to 180lb. Right now, the hearing loss was mild and it won&#39;t be that bad, but normally, it was permanent, which would be disabling hearing loss. She was going 20Jan2021, for the steroid injection in the ear canal. That would be the first injection. She was taking oral steroids now. They would see if this limits the progression. The events outcome was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possible causality between the reported tinnitus/sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, cannot be fully denied based on the reasonable temporal association.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, also reported as &#34;for work.&#34; The patient has no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine on 22Dec2020. She was scheduled to receive the second on 12Jan2021, Tuesday. Since receiving the vaccine, the night of receiving it, she developed a clicking sensation in her right ear. It hasn&#39;t gone away. It was kind of like &#34;when you have water in your ear.&#34; It is not popping like on an airplane. She can trigger it if she hums or makes her vocal cords vibrate. She can make it happen. It is not painful. She notices it a lot at night. It might be a eustachian tube thing. At first, she was wondering if it could be coincidental. She hasn&#39;t experience it before though. It could be related to a sinus thing. But she hasn&#39;t realized a sinus issue. She thought, by now it would have gone away. No one has looked in her ear though. She works in healthcare. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at work. She noticed the clicking in the middle of night so she can&#39;t say an exact time of onset. She thought it might have been improving, but she thinks she is just getting used to it. She is less aware of it now. The patient asked if she should be seen by her HCP or have her ears checked out. She asked if the clicking sound that developed in her ear after getting the first dose of the vaccine was normal? It is persistent like &#34;if you have water in your ear.&#34; It happens mostly at night but is happening right now. The patient further reported having the expected side effects of headache, fatigue and feeling run down since an unknown date. The patient has not recovered from the event &#34;developed a clicking sensation in her right ear/ persistent like &#34;if you have water in your ear&#34;/ notices it a lot at night/ happens mostly at night but is happening right now.&#34; Outcome of the events &#34;headache&#34; and &#34;fatigue and feeling run down&#34; was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

She took 10 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), 150 mg of bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) and 10 mg of doxepin for sleep. Yesterday after the vaccination towards the end of the day (09Jan2021 approximately 11 o&#39; clock am), she developed a stomach ache about 5 pm and it went on throughout the night and she normally didn&#39;t have issues with her stomach. Maybe it was because she was hungry because she went ice skating with her son where they wore mask in the afternoon yesterday and she was feeling perfectly fine. But when she came home, she noticed her stomach started hurting at 5 pm and she wondered maybe it is because she was hungry. And after she ate it was still bothering her and then it got progressively worst in the middle of the night where it would wake her up periodically. But she was so fatigue that she was able to sleep still. But she noticed in the middle of the night that her stomach would wake her up because it was aching and cramping in the middle of the night. And then she also had some sweating in the middle of the night as well as some pain behind her eyes. And today (10Jan2021) she had some fatigue which she noticed was not usual, she had mild headache which she saw was a common side effect. And then in the morning (10Jan2021) some fatigue and weakness like when she walked to the bathroom it was hard for her to walk. And when she went to use the bathroom she had some loose stools which was not common for her unless at all she was sick or have eaten something that makes her stomach really sick which was very unusual for her. Her stomach was still hurting her, if she walked it will start getting cramped so she was sitting down. The only thing she toon this morning was 2 acetaminophen medicine tablets because she was having pain behind her eyes when she woke up. She was just going to say she had influenza type A and type B on several occasions. And these symptoms are similar to when she had type B influenza, which was not as difficult as type A. So this is, they seemed to be like a mild version of type B influenza which she had terrible stomach issues, diarrhea and fatigue and pain behind the eyes from type B influenza. She had not any sickness because she work from home and she had limited field contact. So, she hadn&#39;t had illness from past year now. Because she worked from home. She provided mental health counselling remotely. So, she didn&#39;t think it could be attributed from anything else. The left on arm which was up toward like shoulder area and it was sore but it was tolerable in Jan2021. Outcome of stomach ache/stomach cramping was not recovered, and outcome of other events were unknown.

A 47-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Sinus infection, Kidney stones, pink eye when she was a kid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She reports the following side effects: itchy, red and swollen eyes, itchy throat, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip). The patient experienced Right eye itching, red and swollen eyes/right eye swollen, Right eye pink on 08Jan2021 with outcome recovering, right eye shut on 09Jan2021 with outcome of received on 09Jan2021, itching throat, mucus from throat, clear mucus, Right eye weeping on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered/resolved with sequel on 11Jan2021, Left eye itching on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip) on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Jan2021, right eye red/ right Eye being Red on 09Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021. The patient got her First shot on Thursday morning at 7:30AM, then on Friday night 08Jan2021 at 7 in the evening her right eye was itching and weeping, it felt like something was in the eye but there wasn&#39;t. The right eye was swelling as well on Friday. On Friday the itching of the throat started.  She is also having scratchiness in the throat. Her eye is scratchy also. When she woke up Saturday 09Jan2021 she couldn&#39;t open the right eye, it was glued shut completely and red. When she was a kid, in the past she has had pink eye, and there was green stuff coming out the eye but this was not like previously. She had to pull the eye lids apart, maybe this is viral.  With her throat, she has had sinus infection in the past before in which she couldn&#39;t breath out of the nose, but with this she is experiencing Mucus that is clear and thin from the throat. Her left eye itching started Friday night, but it was only slight itchiness and by Saturday the left eye was normal. She is purely doing this report to help, in case other people have this happen. Early today, she did use a Neti pot and it did help a little, she has had horrible sinus infections in the past but this is not it. In the past, once you get a sinus infection you are prone to getting them, thankfully she has not had one in a few years, she would get thick crap in the sinuses, in this case her eye was draining going into her nose, therefore making her have a runny nose, and she also had scratching in the throat. She is breathing clearly through the nose. Itching in the right eye was ongoing but less intense. Right Eye Swollen: She was looking at mirror hates looking at herself but the eyelid was back to normal, however the white part of eye is still swollen. Right eye being Shut: It is open now, that was a one day occurrence. Itching in the throat: She noticed that today at noon around 1 is when she last had it, it is 5% still there where she feels something. Mucus from Throat: She used the Neti pot a couple hours ago, at about 1:30 PM. Since then she has had some drainage but it is 95% better. Her Right Eye ball is still pink looking like as if she was hung over. The Left eyeball is white. Right Eye Weeping: She left work because her right eye was weeping so much, going into her nose, and she is running at work, she has glasses, goggles, face shield, and so she cant wipe the liquid. She came home and iced her eye which helped. Right Eye Pink: On Saturday the right eye was red. Right now it is pink, like an eye lash is in the eye. The right Eye being Red was only for Saturday, like sclerosis, it was red and swollen. The left eye was swollen, but it is better now from this morning. She was super congested on Friday (08Jan2021), barely being able to sleep, she couldn&#39;t breathe through the nose. Weird, she barely slept but it wasn&#39;t a sinus infection. She couldn&#39;t sleep because of nose running and the eye running then Saturday into Sunday she was able to sleep with eye running. The runny nose got better with the neti pot. She is schedule for the 2nd dose on 28Jan2021. The outcome of other events was unknown. Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

I just don&#39;t want to be around the baby. I thought I was fit but I don&#39;t usually when your body gets the vaccination your body fighting against the vaccine so I don&#39;t think it is going to affect the baby. I just don&#39;t want to get this shot if they got affected and if they are on fever. I just want to make sure before I go over there for Christmas.&#34;  When probed if calling for the first time in Pfizer drug safety department, consumer stated, &#34;No, actually I was just thinking now before I had out I grab these side effects yesterday and I read it I have fever 102, I was like let me call the number from the paper that they gave me with the shot card, let me call you guys and try to figure out what the hell is going on here and why I&#39;m so freaking sick from this shit.&#34; .Height and weight: Consumer stated, &#34;I say about 130 and about 5&#39;6.&#34;.

My smell returned quickly but after the 2nd vaccine my taste returned the next day; I had Covid 31Dec-10Jan with both loss of smell and taste initially.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 48-years-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot-number: EL0104), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 21Dec2020 at 03:00 at a single dose, and the second dose (Lot number: EL3249) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 03:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, did not have any other vaccine within four weeks, and did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took sertraline (ZOLOFT) and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient stated that she regained her taste. She had COVID from 31Dec-10Jan (also reported as on 12Jan2021 at 12:00) with both loss of smell and taste initially. Her smell returned quickly but after the second vaccine, her taste returned the next day. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included viral test (nasal swab; Sofia COVID test): positive on 04Jan2021. The patient received no treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported event and suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

                                                throat swelling; Initially had headache; dizziness; irritability; Throat tingling; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received a single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EJ1685) as the first dose via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Dec2020 06:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia, asthma, prediabetes, and carpal tunnel syndrome. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were not any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient had no previous allergies to vaccines. The patient allergies to medications which included: doxycycline, medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA), metoclopramide (REGLAN), gluten. The patient initially had headache, dizziness and irritability, throat tingling, throat swelling, and difficulty swallowing started around 12 hours after injection, event onset date reported as 29Dec2020 18:00. The events resulted in emergency room/ department or urgent care. The events were reported as non-serious by HCP. Treatment received for the events included diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine embonate (HYDROXYZINE PAMOATE). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pharyngeal swelling together with other symptoms was likely related to the single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                About 3am the next morning I woke up to a loud ringing in both my ear.  When I sat up I was very very dizzy.  I got up and showered and my feet swelled very bad.  I did not feel well but I went to work but the feelings never got better.  So on 1/10 Sunday I went to the medical center because I jjust didnt not feel well.  The swelling in the lower legs was still there so I was prescribed 20 mg of presnisone for 5 days.  The sound changed during the time of the antibotics but after I stopped taking the prednisone the ringing sound came back, my left foot is still numb and my eyes are constantly red and burning even after putting drops in my eyes, I still suffer from headaches and if I turn my head too far left or right I get dizzy still to date.  On 1/14 I was given a 60 mg dose of tapered predinosone for 2 week to help elevate the symptoms but it did not work.  On 2/12 I saw an ENT specialist who performed a hearing test which did produce minor hearing loss and was diagnosed with having Tinnitis.

                                                Tachycardia/her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100/ she checked her pulse it was 115; she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today; Lightheadedness; wobbly; she felt weak; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 29Dec2020 17:45 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2003 and ongoing, tachycardia and major surgery. Concomitant medication included maintenance inhaler (unspecified) for asthma. Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn&#39;t had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn&#39;t feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn&#39;t want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website&#39;s first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn&#39;t fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of the event tachycardia was recovered in Dec2020, event lightheadedness was recovering and unknown for the other events. The reporter assessed the event &#39;tachycardia&#39; as Serious (Medically Significant).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tachycardia with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded. The medical history of tachycardia and asthma medication may be contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The day after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine, I had a massive headache, to the point where I stayed in bed and slept all day.   I also noticed that my brain was foggy.  The next day I was able to move to the couch, but the headache was still severe with continued brain fog.  I called by PCP to see if there was anything that I needed to be doing or taking and she told me that I should start feeling better the next week.   The headache remains but is mild.  I have memory loss and difficulty concentrating.  I am a nurse and over my weekend at work, I had difficulty doing my job because I couldn&#39;t keep track of what I was supposed to be doing and had difficulty charting.  My coworkers even commented that I seemed &#34;really different&#34;, that my memory was poor, I had personality changes (according to one person) and that my standard of care was much less than usual.  One person also commented that seemed to not be able to hear her and kept asking her to repeat herself.  I find myself having to concentrate harder to see when I am reading or typing something.  I missed work on January 14 and 15 because of the mental fogginess and headache.  I thought I was doing better, but I realized that I wasn&#39;t when I returned to work on January 23 and 24.  I have spoken to my PCP on the phone once and am awaiting calls from my PCP and neurologist regarding this event.

I got sick with the first one from about 4ish hours after until the next mid morning maybe?  Then I felt bad again that second night.  I had my vaccine (second) yesterday at 4 PM, and I felt OK going to bed but had a pretty pitiful night.  I woke up at 5 AM and I felt horrible.  That felt like someone took a pair of metal cymbals and slammed them together on my head.  The tinnitus was strong.  I also had body aches and joint pain and felt like I had the flu.  I felt a little better around 1 PM, but felt bad again around 330.  Now I&#39;m miserable again with terrible body aches and chills (this was at 7:38 PM).  I&#39;m sure I will feel better in the morning, just wanted to share my experience.&#34;  Sadly, since then, I have had tinnitus with a metallic ringing in both ears along with hearing loss.  I had some vertigo one day but unsure if this was related.  The tinnitus makes me very sad.  I am a hospitalist and am happy to have been vaccinated, still.  It has been 2 months today, and it remains, unrelenting.  It is worse in the morning and at night.  The hearing loss is difficult.

She used steam inhalation for the congestion. She was not scheduled for the next dose yet, she was just waiting. The patient was wondering if she should do a test for COVID 19. Mentioned she had been healthy all through this year and digging in the COVID 19 all the time but then after the vaccine she got so sick. This was the first day she could get up and did anything. Advised caller to consult her HCP.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the body ache.

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.

At 12 noon I felt progressively worse and had to leave work. I got home and my temp was 100.2 and took more Ibuprofen at 1 PM. At 2PM the body aches and chills were pretty severe- my temp rose to 103.2. I took more Ibuprofen and alternated with TYLENOL and it returned to normal at 10 PM. I notified my Drs office and had a telemedicine visit with Dr at 4PM who thought it was a normal immune response but suggested getting a COVID Test in the meantime before returning to work. I woke up this morning afebrile with no issues notified employee health got a referral and had my COVID test completed at 09:30am. The urgent care MD strongly urged me to report to VAERS, not just CDC as I had yesterday. My COVID tests are still pending.

                                                I felt fine after the vaccine. Did just have a little soreness at the injection site. Then a co-worker told me my voice was strange, was hoarse. I was feeling fine. The next day I lost my sense of smell. Talked to my PCP and he told me to get tested for COVID, to my surprise I was positive. That was on the 28 or 29 of December. I also developed a lump on my neck on the right side and my PCP prescribed a Z Pack. I finished it but it never went away. I developed another lump on my left side when I took the second dose and I am taking Doxycicline for it.

A 51-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:00 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient was working in healthcare and around Covid positive patients daily.  There were no concomitant medications. 10 minutes after getting bnt162b2, patient noticed side effects. Patient had a metallic taste in throat and a few more things. Right after getting it she had a flushed feeling in her body and legs, similar like IV contrast. 10 minutes after that so about 20 minutes later she had mid chest tightness and weakness that was gone after about 40 minutes to an hour. Patient was unable to provide any seriousness criteria, stating it was scary for a moment and she didn&#39;t know what it was, but the mid chest tightness could have progressed to something more serious. That was how she felt at that moment, but after it was all gone, it was not serious. She did not know why or what the reason was or if she was lucky or what. Patient was sitting for 10 minutes after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine and was doing something on her phone when she started experiencing these symptoms unexpectantly. Eventually the nurses observing her after a half hour took her to the emergency room since she wasn&#39;t feeling any better. Patient had emergency room visit for all events. Outcome of events was resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported mid chest tightness and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the plausible temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Waves of nausea and headache continued into the next day. I had not had a migraine in over 2 years prior to this event. Treated with OTC Excedrin at first on Jan 10th, then when that was ineffective took butabital at lunch time and when that was ineffective took Maxalt with phenergan about 5p. The next day on Jan 11th, thought I was better but by 630a nausea returned in waves and headache began building again. Took Maxalt with phenergan about 930a and again at 9p.

                                                I had a mild headache the evening of the shot, I had a headache the next two days that was relieved by Advil. I had a very sore arm at the injection site Friday and Saturday after the shot was given. The arm pain was gone Sunday morning.  I was very tired on Saturday especially and slept through the morning and early afternoon on and off until about 3:00 pm. On Friday during the day, I noticed my right ear starting to feel unusual and uncomfortable.  On Saturday, the ear issue continued, I felt like I had some hearing loss and a constant buzzing and ear fullness feeling.  On Sunday, the ear issued continued with the hearing loss, buzzing and fullness and has through today and hasn&#39;t stopped.  I tried some nasal decongestant on Sunday afternoon, but it didn&#39;t have any effect.  I made an appointment with the ENT doctor on Monday morning for Tuesday.  I had a hearing test on Tuesday and saw the ENT doctor on Wednesday.  He prescribed prednisone and ordered an MRI.  I will be starting the prednisone later today (Wednesday) when the pharmacy has the prescription ready.

I felt pain in my temple and I also felt like my ears were clogged.  My tonugue was tingling and I had pain across my chest.   I had trouble swallowing and taking a deep breath.  The medical providers assessed me and since my heart was not racing and I did not have a rash all over my body, deemed I was okay.  When I went home, I noticed a rash on my chest from my collarbone to my sternum and alongside my ears on my neck.  My sister is an ER Doctor and I did a video conference with her. She had me take Benadryl.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccine nor have I ever had to take Benadryl.

About 2 hours later, symptoms disappeared and I was back to my normal health

                                                I developed a raised rash on my left arm at injection site , had chills and nausea and lots of tenderness at injection site at 3 am (1/1/21)  following injection. The nausea had resolved when I woke up, the rash subsided throughout the day as did the chills.  The most distressing event began on 1/1/2021 , that being sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes which continued and got much worse over the next two days, despite taking sudafed as often as possible.  No other cold or flu symptoms were present and it felt like allergies although I have never had any sort of seasonal allergies.  I finally took Zyrtec for it the evening of 1/3/21 and the symptoms stopped.   Congestion, light sensitivity remain.  I am reluctant to take another dose due to  drowsiness side effect.  Hoping symptoms will all be gone by tomorrow.

After 2 hours of the shot, the left arm began to be noticeably sore.  12 hrs post vaccine, I had flu-like symptoms.  24 hrs post vac, flu-like symptoms continued and the injection site had a visibly 2&#34; swollen, red warm circle and raised area; also, I experienced  considerable  lymph node soreness in left underarm and under jaw (neck area) and itchiness at injection area.   36 hrs post vaccine, the flu-like symptoms subsided, but the injection site continued to grow to 3&#34; red, warm and swollen area.  Also I continued to have the itchiness, sore lymph nodes in the left arm (injection arm).   Today is 48 hours post vac and I continue to have the red, raised, warm and itchy swollen circle at the injection site with soreness in the lymph node glands on left arm.

Occurred within the 5-15 min observation period.  I did not speak up about it as I was trying to analyze it myself and rationalize the symptoms.  It did not cause tachycardia or SOB or intervention but it makes me a little hesitant for the 2nd dose due to my shellfish allergy/sensitivity.   The sensation reminded me of the systemic response when receiving a contrast IV dye.   I did leave a message at the VAERS 800# to ask if I should submit this form but did not want to delay any longer in case this information is helpful with the feedback/data for others.  I understand it is not a true &#34;adverse or sentinel&#34; event but I wanted to report my reaction especially with the shellfish allergy (which I wasn&#39;t aware of to be a risk factor until I read more articles about it).

Severe joint pain (history Rheumatoid Arthritis) began 4 hours later, and she could barely move hands. She had a severe asthma attack (history asthma) 1 hour later. Breathing has been poor since then with many asthma attacks and oxygen level as low as 79%. Still cannot sleep lying down without oxygen level dropping. Seen at Lung Center 12/31/2020 began tapering prednisone dose beginning at 60mg. Didn&#39;t tolerate 40mg so was at 60mg through 1/9/2021. Now decreased to 40 mg and is having increased shortness of breath and more breakthrough nebulizers. 1/4/2021 feeling no better. Given dexamethasone and kept on steroids. Returned to working just at home on 1/11/2021. No history of asthma reaction this severe in past other than post- ablation, but duration then was shorter.

This 53-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine) (dose #1), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 07Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 53-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included food allergy (shellfish) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, drug hypersensitivity (sulfa) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, migraine headaches from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and contrast media allergy (lodine dye) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included propranolol (PROPRANOLOL), vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) and ascorbic acid, zinc (VITAMIN C &#43; ZINC). The patient previously took avelox and experienced drug hypersensitivity. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. On 07Jan2021 at 14:30, the patient experienced metallic taste in mouth, cotton mouth and flush/tingly sensation in extremities (like when receiving IV contrast dye) after receiving vaccine for about an hour after. She did not tell anyone, just tried to work through it. The patient thought it was strange. She has a shellfish allergy/sensitivity, not sure if it was related. On 08Jan2021 (reported as the following day after vaccination), the patient experienced low grade fever, chills, malaise and body aches. Therapeutic measures taken included Advil and Tylenol. The clinical outcome of metallic taste in mouth, cotton mouth, flush/tingly sensation in extremities, low grade fever, chills, malaise and body aches was resolved on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 53-year-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 for given since patient works with COVID patients (COVID-19 immunisation). The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Nurse called asking if she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine 6 days after the 21st day. She tested positive on 05Jan2021 after getting the 1st dose and was still in quarantine. The nurse works at a hospital. She received her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Dec2020, and afterwards donated blood on the same day. She got the vaccine through her place of work. She said when she donated blood on 19Dec2020, her blood was tested for the COVID-19 Virus antibodies, and her blood was negative for the virus antibodies. She lives about 30 mins from work, so she thought she would get both done in the same day. She gave blood right before she got the vaccine. She gave the blood then went and got the Vaccine. She said on 26Dec2020 she went to Entertainment complex as it was her vacation. Her and her family went for 4 days. On 30Dec2020 she returned home with sniffles, fatigue, and no taste. She said she tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus on 05Jan2021. On 30Dec2020 they got back, and on 02Jan2021 she had sniffles and post nasal drip. On 03Jan2021 she did not wanna get out of bed. She was profoundly fatigued. She also lost her smell. She had to go back to work on 07Jan2021, but did not want to go back in unless she was sure she was okay because she works with babies. She had no other symptoms after 03Jan2021, except no smell and no taste. She got tested for COVID and was positive on 05Jan2021 (also reported as 06Jan2021 [pending clarification]). Her and her husband were both positive, but her kids were not. The weird thing was she also on 06Jan2021 got her results back from giving blood and she was negative for COVID on 19Dec2020 prior to getting the vaccine. Caller clarifies that her COVID test was a nasal swab. Patient thought her age may have contributed to her feelings of fatigue. She had indicated she worked in either a hospital NICU or nursery, and that is why she had to quarantine for 14 days. She probably would not have even gotten tested for COVID if she was not a nurse and did not know that losing taste and smell were a sign. She feels fine. She said she was scheduled for her second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021. She said she was now in quarantine for 14 days due to testing positive for the COVID-19 Virus, and her quarantine period ends on 14Jan2021. Since now she is in quarantine, she will miss her second dose which was supposed to be on 12Jan2021.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 53-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization as COVID-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed more than three years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She had no other vaccines on the same day as her COVID vaccine. The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 29Dec2020, and since then she has contracted COVID, and tested positive for it on 07Jan2021 with symptoms. She asked if she still can get the second shot on the 21st day following her first dose. When she got the vaccine, she was fine, just had a sore arm. A couple days before 07Jan2021, she developed allergy symptoms, and so on the 7th (07Jan2021), she went to get tested, and it was positive. She was 235 pounds, but since getting COVID on Jan2021, she is now 224 pounds. She reported that she started to have allergy like symptoms on maybe 05Jan2021, and on the 7th she went to get tested for COVID, because she had started feeling her chest tighten, and congestion, and her back was hurting, and she has a history of asthma, so she wanted to be seen. She confirmed that on 07Jan2021, she had a Rapid test for COVID, and the results came back the same day, as Positive. She was told that she should also have a 48-hour test, so she had that performed as well, and that one also came back positive, but she knew it would, because by then she had lost her taste and smell. The patient is scheduled for her 2nd dose 19Jan2021. She was wanting to know if she can still get the 2nd dose. She was told she needed to wait 30 days from her positive diagnosis before she could get the 2nd dose. She added that she will still be in isolation when her 2nd dose is due. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                One week after the vaccine I was find until....I got out of my car after driving and started staggering and could not function.  Severe dizziness, heavy headedness , nausea and vomiting and a horrible headache.  My husband had to physically muscle me back to my car. He wanted to take me to the ER and I would not let him because of the waiting room is full of COVID positive patients.  I threw up along the way home and multiple times to the point I had drive heaves.  I am a Registered Nurse and felt the symptoms I were experiencing were Vertigo.  I had one bout with Vertigo in 2015 and it was extreme.  I had Meclizine on hand and and took one tablet and slept.  The severity of this was so bad I could not walk unassisted or sit up without falling over. After 6 hours of sleeping I got up, dizziness continued, and vision a little off.  I still do not feel 100% I have had a headache since.  It never dawned on me this could be from the vaccine I had taken a week before.

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 15:45 on left deltoid at a single dose for prevention as frontline health worker at hospital (COVID-19 immunisation). The patient donated blood on 18th and no antibodies were present then. The patient was a former smoker and quit 2 or 3 years ago. Patient diagnosed Osteoporosis in 2015, benign heart arrhythmia in 2005. The patient took 70 mg alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX) once weekly and just a regular OTC daily multivitamin. Caller reported she was having the covid vaccine on 19Dec2020 and began having fever, night sweats, loss of taste and smell and then tested positive for covid. The patient received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine through work on 19Dec2020. She received it at 3:45 pm and should have taken temperature before, but she was afebrile the day before because she donated blood. At 7pm, she had slight temp 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit and by 10:30, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit and she still felt fine. She was surprised that it was that. She woke up at 2:30 am on 20Dec2020 and took her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took 2 Tylenol and went back to bed and felt fine. By morning it was 99 degrees Fahrenheit and then 98 degrees Fahrenheit a little later. She has been afebrile since then. She was a little tired because she gave blood and though it was related. She does not know if it was a side effect or not. It was not significant tiredness and was just not having energy in the evening of 19Dec2020. She also had soreness at injection site that night after 22:00 and the next day. It did not bother her until she woke up in the middle of night, and she noticed her left arm was sore. She received the vaccine at 3:45pm and started with low grade fever at 6:30 pm, earlier stated at 7:00 pm. There was no prescriber. She tested for COVID (PCR) on Saturday, 26Dec2020 at 14:50and it came back positive 28Dec2020 18:45. At 10pm on 19Dec2020, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If she had not been monitoring her temperature, she would not have known. She has been Afebrile since morning of 20Dec2020. Tiredness she related to giving blood and the holidays. She was a little stressed about the holidays and running around. It was very mild. Soreness at injection site was during the night after 10pm when she went to bed. On Wednesday, 23Dec2020, she woke up congested, sniffly, sneezy, with a runny nose. This persisted through Wednesday night. Her sense of taste was off. She had no problem with that on Tuesday. She had some horrible smell at work she recalled, so she knew her sense of smell was fine. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, she had no sense of taste or smell. She could not smell a pine candle. She was congested on Thursday and called employee health on 24Dec2020. This both improved and persisted. She is still congested but it has improved. She has never had a complete loss of sense of taste or smell before. Mild cough started yesterday morning. On the night of 20Dec2020, and 21Dec2020, she developed night sweats. She had not had any night sweats before this since menopause and she woke up really wet. The patient was not hospitalized and not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. She did not know if she was exposed on the day of the vaccine or if a couple of days later if the fever is from the vaccine. She stated what are the chances she goes 10 months and is super careful and then gets the vaccine and test positive. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of sever systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen nor receive mechanical ventilation. No Multiorgan failure. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID- 19. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Not any preexisting diseases worsen during the SARS-CoV2 infection. She would like to know if there is a chance of false positive for this. It would just be her luck to be 10 months and not getting it. She has not gone anywhere without her N95 and then gets the vaccine and gets COVD. She wears mask and face shield at work always. She also wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The outcome of the event slight temperature was recovered on 20Dec2020 and the other event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this patient cannot be completely excluded.

There was no twitch the a muscular contraction that left me unable to walk properly (the left side seem to be the tightest side of by body) .   I also had bilateral jaw pain  (not sure if its was because I was in so much pain in the legs that I was clenching my teeth) I also  had slight numbness on by left face and by the evening I had redness on my left cheek but it went away.   My face still has a bit of muscle sensitivity (tingling sensation) near the mouth and jaw.

She drinks a lot of fluids throughout the day and still has a little cough off and on. During the night her throat is really dry and which causes more coughing which she did not have before the vaccine. They are mostly concerned with the cough and the stuff when read online about the side effects that last about 2-3 days, but these have been since she got the vaccine. They know this is also know and not much known about it or what is normal yet, but they want to know if she could get the second vaccine, would it be okay. It was stated that the seriousness of the events is in the middle of not serious and medically significant. She is worried about the cough since it is ongoing, when reads online the side effects are listed as 2 or 3 days and her side effects have been going on since she got the vaccine which is worrisome. The outcome of the events cough and throat dry was not recovered, event pain was recovering, while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.

IT FEELS LIKE ITS GOING TO GIVE OUT WHILE WALKING.  THE PAIN TRAVELS DOWN MY WHOLE LEG.  IF I STAND STILL OR SIT FOR A WHILE ITS HARD FOR ME TO PUT WEIGHT ON MY LEG.  I HAVE NEVER HAD PAIN IN MY LEG LIKE THIS BEFORE.  I WAS TOLD TO LET VSAFE KNOW DURING MY CHECK IN AND WILL  CALL THE NURSE ON DUTY TONIGHT.  IT&#39;S BECOMING UNBEARABLE.  I AM DUE FOR MY 2ND DOSE ON THE 8TH .

                                                I began to experience a dry throat about 10 minutes after injection - I attributed it to needing a drink. My throat then felt a bit warm and I thought this was due to thirst as well. I left the monitoring area. I was walking to my vehicle and began to feel more of a warm sensation in my throat and not into my upper chest. About 5 minutes after this took place my face became flush and began tingling and feeling sunburned and tight - I looked in the mirror and my cheeks and nose and chin were red and felt extremely warm - I did not have facial swelling that i noticed buy my face felt tingly and like it was sunburned - my eye felt puffy but did not look puffy enough to notice in the mirror. Approximately 30-35 minutes after the immunization,  I took 50mg of Benadryl and 1300mg of Tylenol. I felt my symptoms begin to improve  about 25-30 minutes after taking the medication - my throat and chest were not as warm.  the facial flushing lasted about an hour or hour and a half.   The morning after my immunization I did have a scratchy throat - I did not take any further medication - by the afternoon - this is almost gone - still just a little scratchy.

She had a telehealth visit with doctor on  1/10/21 - she reported that the itchiness and swelling were along her upper eyelid near the brow line.  Denied ocular pain, EOMI,  conjunctive is not infected.  Noted slight particles in the corners of her eye but it was not crusting.  Had used hydrocortisone cream on the area but was advised by doctor to stop.  Dr encouraged cold compresses, increased fluid intake and avoid salt/caffeine.

A 56-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular (IM) in right deltoid on 07Jan2021 15:30 at second single dose for preventative. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016 for immunisation and experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue, first dose bnt162b2, via IM in left deltoid for preventative on 18Dec2020 at 18:00 and patient was tender in her left arm, the first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. No prior other vaccinations administered within 4 weeks. The patient took the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Thursday 07Jan2021 at 15:30. She called employee health and was advised to call Pfizer to report side effects since she is not feeling good. She had never had the covid diagnosis. On Friday (08Jan2021) she worked all day and felt arm soreness and sinus congestion but nothing out of the ordinary. The patient reported her right arm was still tender to touch, if she rotated her arm she can feel that she had the shot and she was still tender in her left arm from the first shot. The first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. On 08Jan2021 evening she felt really lightheaded, she thought maybe it was her sinuses since it is dry due to winter. She felt like a truck hit her. She had a low grade headache. On 09Jan2021, she felt a little nauseous, queasy, no vomiting. On Saturday (09Jan2021) she had a low grade temp of 100.3 degrees F. She had the chills and shakes on Saturday and most of yesterday. She got up today (reported on 12Jan2020) at 5:30 am, she checked her temperature and it was 97.2 after the shower, an hour later it was 98 degrees F. She felt like she had to keep clearing her throat, her chest felt a bit tight which started Friday evening, the chest tightness was not terrible but it was there. She was not wheezing but when she took a deep breath she felt a little like a wheeze and she had to cough, she had a scratchy throat on 09Jan2020. She stayed home from work yesterday. The patient did not feel lightheaded today, felt it yesterday and did not notice it at all this morning, reported it has resolved. The sinus pressure and congestion started Friday night, she felt stuffy. She had a decreased sense of smell and taste on 09Jan2021. Unless something is right in front of her, she could not smell anything. She felt quite nauseous this morning but at the moment her nausea is under control. She had a decreased sense of taste, everything she ate or drunk had a metallic taste to it, on 09Jan2021. She felt that all the side effects mentioned were related to getting the vaccine. On 08Jan2021, she also experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue which had improved after a hot shower, that helped. She felt like she had a bad flu shot. The only time she ever felt similar to this was when she received the H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016. She did not have lot number, NDC, or expiration date to provide. Treatment included: took Tylenol on Saturday. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office (she is trying to get an appointment to see the doctor). Outcome of the event lightheaded was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events low grade headache, chest tightness, scratchy throat, sinus pressure and congestion, decreased sense of smell, decreased sense of taste, everything she eat or drinks has a metallic taste to it, arm soreness was not recovered, of events chills and shakes, muscle stiffness, fatigue was recovering, of other events was unknown.

A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 15:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a skilled nursing facility or long term care facility. The patient received no other vaccinations recently. Medical history included attention deficit disorder diagnosed at least 5 years ago for which the patient was taking Ritalin; hypothyroidism diagnosed a long time ago, probably 10 years and depression diagnosed a long time ago, probably at least 25 year, she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this (no further details provided about her anti-depressants). The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function/eyes could not focus before when her doctor put her on an antibiotic (unspecified). The patient was also very overweight. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN; lot: unknown, expiry: 28Jul2021) for attention deficit disorder and the patient takes a cocktail of anti-depressants (unspecified) for her depression. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 3 PM and by 5PM she was experiencing bad headache, fever, L arm (injection site) pain that was severe. Later that evening she had blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function. She also got a fever of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, was dizzy and her eyes could not focus and were almost like double vision but not quite, it was hard to explain. She just remembered that she had a similar reaction with her eyes before, when her doctor put her on an antibiotic. She cannot recall what antibiotic that was. The patient also experienced dizziness on 11Jan2021. The patient treated her side effects with ibuprofen and most of these improved. The injection was given in her left arm, her non-dominate one. She says that the pain was so bad it woke her up, and she doesn&#39;t take any pain meds, but that was really bad. She says that she took some Ibuprofen (lot: P113671, exp: Jan2022), about a total of 800mg over a few hours. Her fever had started pretty fast, by 05:00PM on the 11th, and it was better after taking the Ibuprofen, as was her arm pain, and headache. She says that the dizziness went away probably around 02:00AM the following day (12Jan2021). She says her eyes can focus again as well. The patient thinks that these effects are medically significant, mostly that her eyes were not able to focus, it was very scary. The patient stated that the purpose of this call is to have this documented, and possibly find out if there are recommendations that she should not get the second dose, since she had to call out of work because she couldn&#39;t function. The outcome of the event &#34;blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function; eyes wouldn&#39;t focus, couldn&#39;t function&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date and dizziness recovered on 12Jan2021 at 02:00. The outcome of the event &#34;she had to call out of work because she couldn&#39;t function&#34; was unknown while the other events were recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 56-year-old female patient had medical history included attention deficit disorder; hypothyroidism and depression and she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this. The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function/eyes could not focus. Based on information reported, the reported double vision and difficulty focusing eyes were more likely due to pre-existing condition (s); and less likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The rest events fever, headache, vaccination site pain and dizziness were likely causally related to the use of vaccine due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had most of side effects described. My ears hurt, like inside, but the most that bothers me today is that my heart feels like its beating and racing fast, sometimes feels like its pounding. Very uncomfortable, my chest feels.

Approx. 45 minutes later she became flushed, felt lightheaded/intoxicated/giddy/silly while driving home. She said she was extremely hungry (&#34;like a big dose of steroids&#34;). She states her ears were ringing and when she laid down at 2130 she could feel her heart beating throughout her body. This AM she reports feeling &#34;hungover/groggy/nauseated&#34;. She denied any lip/tongue swelling, any lip or extremity tingling, difficulty breathing, any injection site redness/heat/swollen/painful area, fever, chills, or ever having a vaccine reaction previously. Spoke with individual w/pharmacy. Advised to report to VAERS. Not an expected reaction. Possibly related to aleve vs. covid vaccine.

A 57-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Lot: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on deltoid right on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, hypothyroidism, and environmental allergies. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC) at 10 mg, daily for blood pressure high, and levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT) at 112 mcg (ug) for hypothyroidism. Patient got Covid Vaccine on Tuesday (22Dec2020) night and was fine on Wednesday (23Dec2020). She expected the normal side effects like maybe a little fever like that but she believed she was having allergic reactions. It started from 24Dec2020 and she got a rash on all her chest and in abdomen and also just like itchiness feeling all over. So she took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and a PPI &#39;a cup of&#39; them on 24Dec2020 and she thought that she only had to do that one&#39;s today (25Dec2020) and the only thing she noticed when she got the shot (Covid Vaccine) they kept her there for like 15 minutes and her eyes got red and itch. She didn&#39;t scratch them but they felt like itchy and she never had that before. She never had a problem with the vaccine before. She didn&#39;t know if that was the true allergic reaction to the vaccines or if it just something she had internal allergies and she just didn&#39;t know what it was. But she was okay at the time of the report. She took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride a little while before and a PPI (unspecified medication). She was still itchy but it was not that bad and she seemed to be doing fine. Her arm was fine. She was not having any (unspecified), except sometimes. 24Dec2020 she had chills which she expected and she was all good but the side effects whatever happened that way was not the allergic portion. She tried to contact the doctor. The doctor just switched his clinic only for geriatric patients. She had to find another doctor. She knew a Doctor whom she could try and call and she actually went to the infectious disease physician and he said she should go to get the vaccine, now she was trying with that too. She got allergic to anything. Covid Shot was the only thing new that she had in her life but like she was not sure if it was triggered by something out like (unspecified) because she had always environmental allergies too. She didn&#39;t know because she was going to consult the Physician on Monday. She was just going to see the regular doctor. She was just seeing that first that anything because she knew it didn&#39;t happen very often but the Covid vaccine she just wanted to make report. She was going to the Physician on Monday because right now she thought she didn&#39;t know how long it lasted like. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Next afternoon, Jan 5, I got severe myalgias, fever up to 100, severe fatigue, went home after work and slept til the next morning, went to work, took ibuprofen, and the myalgias improved and felt better. But around 3 pm, Jan 6, I got mild vertigo. By about 7pm Jan 6, I noticed my L ear didn&#39;t hear well. I changed the battery in my hearing aide and cleaned it but It made no difference. I woke up on Jan 7 with severe vertigo and hearing loss. I did Epley&#39;s maneuvers with no effect. I have had similar episodes. I went to work, but gave up when I could not hear patients talking to me. I went to the Emergency Dept and got admitted. I was too unsteady on my feet. Audiogram showed profound hearing loss both ears and almost complete loss of discrmination in R ear. I was put on high dose steroids. Also having tinnitus (mostly whooshing sound of my own pulse). MRI negative. Blood work negative. Some mild improvement now, after 1 dose steroids.

We gave diphenhydramine 50mg at 2:16 pm. Then at 2:35 pm her symptoms were not improved her blood pressure was 80/40 so we gave one dose of 0.3mg epinephrine by auto-injector and called an ambulance. Post epinephrine her vision improved but her skin was still red and starting  to itch. She was talking and said she was feeling a little better. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital for additional treatment. There was not reaction visible at the injection site it appeared to  be all systemic.

A 57-year-old female patient received the second dose of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 16:45 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included, lactose intolerance. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.), probiotics (PROBIOTICS), clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]), ibuprofen (MOTRIN [IBUPROFEN]), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took Parafon Forte and experienced allergies. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ek5730) on 17Dec2020 17:15 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced aches, chills, menstrual like cramps, fatigue, eye burning, and low grade temp on 07Jan2021 15:00. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events were assessed as non-serious. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number EJ1685, expiration date: 31Mar2021), intramuscularly on 20Dec2020 17:43 at left deltoid, at single dose for vaccination. Medical history included asthma and diabetes. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 20Dec2020. On 22Dec2020 she was exposed to Covid, on 28Dec2020 developed symptoms of cough, chills, lost of taste and smell, she had onset of COVID virus symptoms on 28Dec2020 with positive COVID result from COVID nasal swab test performed on 29Dec2020. She has already completed her Bamlanivimab infusion therapy to treat COVID virus on 31Dec2020. Her 2nd dose is due on 10Jan2020 and she wanted information on the use of antibody therapy with the Covid-19 vaccine. She asked if she should still get the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled on 10Jan2021 relative to these events. She reported she still has COVID symptoms which have improved, but the symptoms she can&#39;t taste or smell are ongoing and persistent. Seriousness criteria: she thought it was serious but she was not injured or anything with it; she thought event was offset it by taking some medication and the Bamlanivimab infusion. In addition to Bamlanivimab infusion for treatment of the COVID virus she was also prescribed Azithromycin for 5 days started on 29Dec2020 which she completed; and Prednisone for 7 days started on 29Dec2020 which she stopped after 5 days of therapy because she did not like how it made her feel. The outcome of the event was recovering. Event relatedness between Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and COVID virus was unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, lack of efficacy of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. However, individuals may not be protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. It is unlikely that the patient would have fully developed immunity due to the very short time lag between the first vaccine dose and the event onset.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure from 2008 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine from 2017 and ongoing at 5 mg at night for high blood pressure, losartan from 2017 and ongoing at 12mg once in the morning for high blood pressure. Following her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020, the patient had throat tightening, metallic taste in her mouth. She was scheduled to have her 2nd dose today (07Jan2021) and would like to know what to do and if she was still covered 80% from the 1st dose of her COVID vaccine shot. When she got her first COVID shot 3 weeks ago she got a metallic taste in her mouth and her throat tightened up a little. Throat tightening happened right after she got the shot and lasted about less than 2 minutes. She also turned red when she got it. Then about 14 hours later, on the same day she got nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak. This lasted until about 20Dec2020 as well. She was supposed to get 2nd dose today (07Jan2021). Before her first shot she had taken paracetamol and hydrochloride prior. She also took both of those today (07Jan2021). But then she was reading through the paperwork and it says that a severe reaction includes tightening of the throat. She was not sure if what she had was truly a reaction or not. She did not have other allergies. She had many flu shots and never had any difficulty with those. She was a nurse, she wanted the second dose, but she was concerned about the throat tightening, and it getting worse with the second dose. She was unsure of seriousness. She figured that she would get aches and pains. Everyone else who got it said their arm hurt, but nothing else. She thought it was weird. She was just wired differently she guesses. The action taken in response to the events for paracetamol and hydrochloride was  unknown. The outcome of events throat tightening, turned red was recovered on 17Dec2020. The outcome of event metallic taste in her mouth, nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak was recovered on 20Dec2020.

Took 25 mg Benadryl while in her car.  No swelling and no respiratory distress.  After 30 minutes, she didn&#39;t feel worse so she drove home (50 minute drive).  Her symptoms resolved around 9pm (about 1 hour, 20 minutes after taking Benadryl).

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine on 04Jan2021 and yesterday (11Jan2021) she tested positive for COVID-19. Patient would like to know if she should follow-up for the second dose of the vaccine on 25Jan2021. Patient mentioned that maybe she should follow up with the second dose. It was also reported that the patient wanted to know if the vaccine could have given her COVID-19 and tested positive. Patient further clarified it to be the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned she is a caregiver and received the vaccine on last Monday (04Jan2021). On Friday (08Jan2021), the patient started to notice she was getting headaches. The headache started in the morning. Patient realized she was irritable all day and as a caregiver, this is not an attitude to have. Patient did not feel great that day. Patient also realized that the sun had been bothering her eyes as she was driving, it was some eye sensitivity going on. That night patient got home and was able to eat, but the next day on Saturday (09Jan2021), she did not have any sense of taste or smell. Patient had lost her sense of taste and smell. Patient realized this when she woke up at 6 am for coffee and could not taste or smell it.

A 57-year-old female patient received single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number: EL0142, exp date not reported), intramuscular (by injection once left arm, below shoulder blade in muscle) on 13Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (because of job). Medical history included two stroked from 1998 and 2005. Concomitant medication included oral donepezil started taking 3 months ago (Oct2020) for something having to do with muscles because of stroke. She takes a blood thinner, as she had 2 strokes; and takes muscle relaxers too. By 15Jan2021 (Friday morning) the patient was feeling bad, she couldn&#39;t go to work, she lost her taste and her smell, part of smell. Part of taste was back at the time of reporting, but she was tired and sleeping all the time (onset date reported as 15Jan2021). She saw her neurologist because she had 2 strokes, they referred her to Pfizer, as they said she may have already had COVID 19 with the symptoms she has, but as far as she knows, she didn&#39;t have it, she took a test with the center a month before giving the vaccine, she took the vaccine because of her job, because of the kind of job she has, and they wanted her to let Pfizer know she was sick. She doesn&#39;t know if she wanted to get the other dose, as she was not feeling well at all. She was laying down sleeping every day. Her doctor said to tell Pfizer what was going on. She still doesn&#39;t feel good the day of reporting. She still hasn&#39;t eaten a whole meal since 15Jan2021. She thinks she was probably getting better, but was getting better slowly, she has no taste, she was not able to eat, no smell at all, which was really not a good thing. She can&#39;t tell the outcome of no smell she thinks. She can&#39;t smell nothing at all. She can&#39;t smell what she was cooking. It was the same as taste, she thought that is probably why she can&#39;t eat, she can&#39;t taste what she was eating. Taste was improved, but not well enough for her, it is hard to explain, you know how you enjoy food, like how it tastes, and if you can&#39;t taste, you can&#39;t eat. She sleeps all day, she was up now, but is probably going to go to sleep, she feels tired and needs to lay down. She told her doctor she will call and see what Pfizer says, they will go from there. She doesn&#39;t know if she will have to go see if she has COVID 19, or what was going on.  No further investigation assessment was performed. The patient took a test a month before (results unknown). No taste was recovering (ongoing at the time of reporting) while outcome of other events was not recovered.

I called the Pfizer hotline, and they took down some information and then directed me to call the COVID hotline which resulted in pretty much the same.  As it was Christmas day and the weekend, I waited to contact my Primary Physician on 12/30/20.  She saw me immediately and sent me to a Specialist the next day to see Dr. for my hearing loss.  There I was given an audiological assessment where my right ear was found to have moderately severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.

On the next day noticed redness and pain in the left eye. On 1/6/21 noticed diminished  vision and blurriness in the left eye. Called opthalmology  ED and was seen the next day on 1/7/2021 morning .  Was diagnosed with left uveitis. I was seen by the on call doctor.  There are many doctors involved in my care. My previous episodes of uveitis have been mostly in the right eye and the vision was not affected,  The doctors involved in my care are not sure if this was just a coincidence, was an exacerbation of the preexisting pathology or was something new.  I have asked to put the eye drops every hourly but the vision has not completely improved. I don&#39;t use the eye drops in the night and when I get up in the morning it is still very hard to read.  It is an unusual episode of uveitis as typically my left eye is not involved and I have never had this much diminished vision , I am supposed to put the drops every one hourly until 1/11/2021. I have informed my PCP, Rheumatologist, regular eye doctor.  I will inform my ID doctor Dr .

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

She can really feel for the residents she works with who get it. Right now, she was hopefully going back to work next week, but she was wondering about the second vaccine. People are saying she got COVID-19 because of receiving the first vaccine and she was hoping it was not the case. Is it going to be an issue getting the second vaccine after testing positive? The caller declines to include her healthcare professional for this report, stating she has been talking with her doctors over the week.

Medical history included thyroid disease and asthma. Concomitant medication included montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient received dose 1 of the vaccine on 12Jan2021 and developed Covid symptoms and on 18Jan2021, the patient was tested positive, was sick from all and had fever (stopped at end). On an unspecified date, the patient stated she was just at the hospital on Tuesday, in emergency room and they told me that she should report possible side effects from the Covid vaccine. The patient have the Third Nerve Palsy they think this might be connected to the vaccine they are not sure. When paraphrased the concern, consumer stated, &#34;They said I should just report that there was a reaction and they don&#39;t know if the Third Nerve Palsy is due to the vaccine or just something freak that I got.&#34;  When probed if patient was a Health Care Professional, consumer stated, &#34;I am not, I am a manager.&#34; The patient also added, &#34;Can I give you the Path Gram, on the 9th I had my first shot on the 12Jan, I developed Covid symptoms and on 18Jan I was tested positive, I was sick from all and finally got tested on the 18 and was Positive and finally stopped my fever at end, I think may be 01Feb, and they told me to get my second shot I got my second shot on 05Feb and on 15 I started having vision problems which was like little blurry and I went to my eye doctor and they didn&#39;t think anything else he said that it could be something from Covid like what they called continuing symptoms but not having Covid, I don&#39;t know what the terminology is or it could have been from vaccine then that was the 15, the following Monday I went to my Primary because my vision was double at this point in my right eye and they thought it might be sinus related I had a CT done came back normal they told me that they thought it was Third nerve palsy and I had a MRI in the meantime they told me to go back to my Ophthalmologist which I did on Tuesday as soon as he see my he sent me to emergency room cause he thought it was an Aneurysm, so I was in the Emergency room being examined in hospital in (withheld) when I spoke to the Doctor they said I should advise Pfizer that they can&#39;t prove but it&#39;s vaccine related.&#34; When the patient was asked about teatment: she stated, &#34;Well right now what they are doing is they had an had a MRI to be sure it was not Aneurysm or brain tumor which thank God came back negative and they did blood work so they are assuming it&#39;s third Nerve Palsy at this point but I have to see in 4 weeks it clears up or it could be Myasthenia gravis.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date unknown) via unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cholesterol, blood pressure (controlled blood pressure), hypothyroidism. Concomitant medications included TELMISARTAN (MICARDIS) for blood pressure and ATORVASTATIN (LIPITOR) for cholesterol; both on unspecified date. The patient was asking if she was able to get the 2nd dose of vaccine, since she was tested positive for Covid-19 (31Dec2020) after receiving 1st dose. The patient was asking information about missing 2nd dose and when can she get it and wanted to know if it was still okay to get the second dose. The patient asked if she needed to have a test negative for covid-19 prior to receiving 2nd dose. The patient experienced no sense of taste and actually realized it on 29Dec2020 that her food was not tasting good. The patient didn&#39;t notice her smell was gone until she was cooking the chicken curry, she even tested it out by spraying some perfume, she has no sense of smell on 30Dec2020. The patient informed that both her taste and smell returned 02Jan2021 but was not recovered completely. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included A1C: 6.4 on 12Dec2020, COVID-19 PCR test: positive on 31Dec2020, Covid-19 rapid test: positive on 31Dec2020. The patient informed that she had no positive test before the Covid-19 vaccine, she took Covid-19 antibody test in Apr2020 and it was negative. The outcome of the events tested positive for Covid-19 after receiving 1st dose was unknown, no sense of taste and smell was gone/no sense of smell was recovered with sequel on 02Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.

                                                About 2 min after receiving injection, I felt an intense flushing feeling all over, it felt as if my blood had turned into lava. About a minute after that I felt a &#34;tickle&#34; in my throat. The same sensation I felt  when I had my reaction to Gadolinium.  I tried to swallow, and it was a little difficult. I did NOT feel short of breath. I tried to calm down by doing slow concentrated breathing. I continued to take small sips of water to gauge my swallowing ability. After about 2-3 minutes, the flushing sensation subsided, and swallowing started to improve.  I had brought my Epinephrine pen with me.  About 1-2 min after the flushing sensation had subsided,, it came back and my swallowing ability got much worse, to the point I couldn&#39;t  swallow a small sip. I was breathing well, and did NOT feel short of breath, but gave myself my Epinephrine injection at that time. A Rapid Response was called at that time, my vitals signs taken, an IV inserted, 911 called. O2 sats were fine mid 90&#39;s, heart rate was mid 80&#39;s, BP was elevated,  I don&#39;t remember the exact systolic 170-180, but my diastolic was 116. It took the ambulance approximately 10-15 min to arrive. By the time the ambulance arrived, I was feeling close to my baseline and my BP was improving.  I was seen by the ER MD, and feeling fairly well, my throat still felt a tiny bit tight, but no difficulties swallowing.  The plan was to complete  treatment with IV steroids, Benadryl, and Pepcid, then be observed for a few more hours. This was approximately around 16:30. Not more than 5 min after MD left my room, I got the flushing feeling, and throat closing feeling again. While the medications were being prepared these  symptoms increased, ( I could still breath adequately and vital signs were still  OK.  It took about 10 minutes after meds were given for symptoms to begin to subside ( No epi given) I was observed until 21:30 then discharged. I am taking 50 mg daily x 3 days, 25mg Benadryl q 8hrs x 3 days, and 20mg Pepcid bid x 3 days. I feel fine , no further episodes

I developed very severe migraine headaches and was hospitalized. I still have not regained my balance. I have had a couple of courses of prednisone and migraine medication. My neurologist is setting up IV I G transfusions feeling that I?m having an auto immune response to the vaccine.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow&#39;s milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that&#39;s what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week.

                                                Within a few hours of shot, I experienced EXTREME tinnitus (very loud), numbness in head, face and lips and hardening of lymph gland in left chest. This lasted for hours. Injection site pain only lasted about 24 hours.  Since then, I still have numbness on the right side top of head and intermittent EXTREME  tinnitus that interferes with my ability to concentrate, communicate and sleep. It comes and goes but the volume is beyond anything I have ever experienced. Then it goes away. The  right side of my head has stayed numb.   Will this go away? Should I get the 2nd dose or not?
