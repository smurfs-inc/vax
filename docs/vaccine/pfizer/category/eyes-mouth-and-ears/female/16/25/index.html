I started sweating, my vision started to turn black and I felt that like I was going to faint. I then became extremely nauseated and threw up. after about ten minutes the symptoms started mildly passing. I then began sweating again, feeling like I was going to faint, and I threw up a second time. These symptoms lasted for about an hour where I felt nauseous and faint. Then flowing these symptoms I felt dizzy for another 3 hours and continued having body aches for another 2 days.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 at 09:30 at a single dose in the workplace clinic for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and history of vasovagal syncope following vaccinations; this adverse reaction to the vaccination directly aligns with other episodes that have occurred to her following vaccinations/interactions with needles (ie. blood draws). The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levonorgestrel (MIRENA). On 25Jan2021 at 09:30 (after getting the vaccine), the patient felt herself losing consciousness, her vision went blurry first and she was able to brace herself by lying down against a wall, and low blood pressure following event (50/20). Blood pressure and pulse rose over the next 25 minutes. 15 minutes more of observation was completed. The patient did not receive treatments for the events. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.
