                                                Patient is a 16yo seen for her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. She was seated in the back seat of the car. Shortly after receiving her vaccine (within a few minutes), she chose to move to the front passenger seat of the car, and after sitting in the passenger seat she became lightheaded and lost consciousness. Syncopal event was witnessed and lasted a few seconds. She spontaneously regained consciousness, and complained of some lightheadedness and tunnel vision. No significant confusion was noted, her responses to questions were appropriate. Initial pulse was thready and heart rate initially difficult to auscultate. Pale color noted on the face. Initial pulse approximately 50bpm. Breath sounds clear with good air exchange. Patient was placed in a reclined position with feet on the dash.  She quickly recovered and repeat heart rate was auscultated at approximately 70bpm, stronger pulse noted. She was noted to have improvement and she was then driven out of the vaccine site after obtaining consent from her mother (who was the driver) and parked beside EMS. BP was 100/50 and HR 68-72, SaO2 97%.  Lightheadedness resolved and she was feeling well, at her baseline.  She was monitored for 30 min then allowed to leave with her mother, she was at her baseline at last evaluation. Per history review with her mother, she has had 2 prior episodes of syncope with pin removal from hand after surgery and IV placement.

                                                The patient passed out completely while sitting after having her 1st covid vaccine.  She was alert shortly thereafter but had blurry vision and low blood pressure.  She said she was very hot and was sweating somewhat.  We gave her some water and gradually she started feeling better.  In the meantime, we had call 911 and when they evaluated her, they felt it was somewhat of a panic attack since she did have anxiety before getting the vaccine.

                                                Pt. received her second Pfizer dose at 3pm. By 11:30pm she had significant swelling on both of her eyes, mouth, and the start of red splotchy skin on arms and legs. We took her to ER. They gave her 50mg of hydroxizine and sent us home. 5min after leaving the ER at 12:30am on 4/23 she felt a golf ball sized lump in her throat and was having difficulty breathing. We brought her back to the ER.  At this time they gave her an ekg, and at around 1:30am gave her an epi pin and an oral steroid. Within 5min of the oral steroid and epi pin she no longer had difficulty in breathing and the lump in her throat was gone as was the res splotches. By 5am the swelling in her face had reduced drastically to 90% normal in her left eye and 70% normal in her right eye and 70% normal in her lip. She was released from the ER at 5:45am and went home to sleep. At 11:30am on 4/23 her swelling in her face remains the same and she is complaining of a headache. She was given 50mg more of hydroxizine.

                                                After RN administered vaccine she spoke to my daughter for some time afterwards 5-6 minutes and my daughter was fine answering her questions and just visiting with her. She directed us to the table to schedule her second vaccine which was directly in front of us. We went to this table and spoke with two other ladies choosing a date and time and she was also fine talking with them and answering questions of eat time offered and then suddenly she went straight back with warning passed completely out and struck the back of her head on the concrete floor. EMS and RN?s who were there went to her aid immediately and she was unconscious for a little over a minute. They initially couldn?t get her to respond and finally she came to and had no idea what happened and no recollection of falling. She had blurred vision and bleeding a bit from the back of her head and they wanted her to have CT of her head after hitting it that hard. They took her by ambulance to hospital and they assessed her and ordered a CT. The CT thankfully came back clear and she has follow up appointment with concussion doctor first thing in the morning. On discharge she was describing her pain from hitting head a 7/10 It was very scary and everyone around us was visibly upset as well. She has never fainted or had a reaction to any other shot, vaccine or needle before today so that was a very unusual reaction.

The COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech 0.3mL administered IM in right deltoid while patient was sitting. Patient remained sitting for 10 minutes after administered dose. Patient reported feeling well after the injection. Patient stood up while we continued to talk, after 2 more minutes passed out while standing. Suddenly, patient begain to go limp and her eyes crossed and rolled back. Patient fell backwards into the privacy curtain and into aisle 13 of the store. Patient&#39;s head bounced off the floor. Immunizer  knelt next to patient. Patient was unresponsive until immunizer placed cold hand on back of neck and front of chest to check if she was breathing, immunizer calmly  guided patient to breath, slow deep breaths into the belly and patient&#39;s eyes fluttered open. She said her head hurt really bad. Immunizer offered to the accompanying adult to call EMS because patient should be evaluated after hitting her head so hard. The accompanying adult denyed EMS, then stating that patient had previously fainted while walking and said that she would be fine. Immunizer advised patient to remain laying down while immunizer got some ice. Ice was then placed on the back of the head. Patient slowly stood up after laying for 10 minutes and was walked over to a sitting area to put feet up and continue with ice for another 5 minutes before the accomanying adult wanted to leave.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

                                                Patient started to feel strange within 1 minute of receiving the vaccine.  Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, patient felt very faint, dizzy, nauseous, tingly, lost feeling in lower body, blurry vision, and started shaking.  EMS was called at vaccination site.  EMS arrived about 5 minutes later and took patient&#39;s blood pressure.  First reading was 102/70, second reading a few minutes later was 108/76.  By that time, patient could sit up and was alert and oriented.  Patient never lost consciousness.  Patient was not taken to the ER.   Patient remained on-site for another 45 minutes until symptoms resolved enough that she felt it was safe to leave.  Patient has not had a reaction to vaccines or other medical treatment in the past.

And her nose started to bother her.  She took a Benadryl, a two hour nap, and then she was fine. She&#39;s never had an allergic reaction to anything, but it seems like she may have just had her first.  I received the same vaccination at the same time, and no reaction at all for me.

                                                Patient not seen in office.  History obtained via phone from father of patient and patient herself.  Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

                                                After only an hour outside in low 60s weather, I had felt symptoms similar to heat exhaustion. My vision got extremely spotty, and couldn?t see much. There was a loud ringing in my ears and everything else sounded muffled. I felt dizzy and my skin felt like tissue paper.  It faded after I went inside and got water. However, I still have a headache, 6 hours later.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

Mom at pts side and sts pt first passed out at the age of 4 years old when she witnessed her father having blood drawn for a health screen.   She also reportedly passed out after receiving a vaccine at Pharmacy in 2017.  Due to her history of injection related syncopal episodes, pt is placed in a supine position on the cot as precaution. Approximately 30 seconds after receiving the injection, the pt was witnessed becoming unresponsive by this HCP.  Pt was then witnessed having her eyes roll up and back followed by a  few seconds of generalized seizure activity.  HCP remains at pts side.  The cot has a suspended cloth and is soft, therefore, pt is safe from harm on it.   Seizure ends after seconds and pt awakens.  She is initially confused but orients quickly.  She remains AOX4 and has no complaints.  Spoke with mom extensively about pts condition and presenting symptoms.  VS- HR initially 52 but quickly improves to 77, BP 107/64, RR 16, sats 98%.  Pt will follow up with  pts pediatrician.  Mother and pt do not want pt evaluated at the ER today and do not want an ambulance.  VAERS info given.

                                                Approximately two minutes after vaccine injection, pt started to feel dizzy, saw spots, felt like she was going to pass out. Someone got a wheelchair and we took her back to observation/treatment area. Patient was very drowsy, felt nauseous, hands were tingling, and was cold and clammy.  We asked her to text her Mom, who was sitting out in the parking lot, to have her come inside.  Pt reported passing out with HPV vaccine and on blood draws.  We moved patient to pt bed and took vitals (listed below).  Patient was able to recover without any medication administration under close observation.  After about 20 mins in obs/treatment area, she was feeling better and we moved her to the observation room with her Mom.  We had leftover vaccine syringes, so Mom received her first dose of vaccine.  They waited together until Mom&#39;s 15 mn obs time was over.  Patient and someone left the clinic feeling fine and under their own power around 1845.

                                                At 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient had noted a dry, scratchy feeling in her throat and asked if I (mom) had brought a water bottle with us (I had not).  At 20 minutes post-vaccination, patient began feeling her throat tightening, tongue swelling, and stated that her lips/mouth/tongue had a tingling sensation. At this point she was taken to the nurse/paramedic to be monitored with EKG, pulse oximetry, and given a bottle of water to drink. After 30 minutes of monitoring, the nurse/paramedic asked patient if her symptoms were improving and if she felt well enough to go home.  She said that her symptoms were not gone, but improving, so she was told to sign a waiver/refusal of care form and released. However, at 11 hours post vaccination (1:30 AM), the symptoms returned (tongue swelling, throat tightening, tingling sensation in and around her mouth).  I administered Benadryl (2 tablets), monitored for 30 minutes, and symptoms improved.   No further symptoms after that point.

                                                On 5/9 at approx 8 or 9pm patient started experiencing a severe headache. Given her history of allergies and angioedema, I had her take 25 mg of oral Benadryl in addition to 500mg of Tylenol. This morning (5/10) when she woke up her upper lip was severely swollen. This sometimes happens with her angioedema, but it is always unilateral, stopping abruptly at midline. This time the swelling was bilateral, involving the entire upper lip, and was more severe than she has ever experienced. She took 240mg Allegra and 40mg Prednisone per MD instructions. Swelling started improving in the afternoon. Patient has known triggers for angioedema, but had none recently, nor had she experienced any angioedema in the last few months.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced rash on 27Apr2021, itching on 28Apr2021, tongue is numb and tingling on 27Apr2021, allergic reaction on 27Apr2021, she thought it was acne at first, but at the injection site she broke out on 27Apr2021, rashes on both arms/saw other red dots appear on 27Apr2021. Clarified allergic reaction as: She thought it was acne at first, but at the injection site she broke out. She has rashes on both arms. Rash seems to be spreading. Really started to show on day two and day three. Hasn&#39;t taken anything for it. She tends to break out on her arms, that&#39;s just her own body, but she saw other red dots appear that hadn&#39;t been there on her arms. She was itching last night and that was new. Is not itching as of now. She went to the hospital and was told to take Benadryl. Clarified she went to the vaccination facility, which was the hospital, and she was asked what was going on. She was not a patient of the ER and was not admitted to the hospital. Forgot to mention her tongue has been numb and tingling for a couple of days. First noticed it when she had something cold, but has persisted even without drinking something cold. Started Tuesday, 27Apr2021, night. Wondering if that is a side effect. Read in the pamphlet it is part of an allergic reaction. Read that rash is a part of a severe reaction.Outcome of all events was not recovered.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events.

                                                Patient was administered the vaccine around 6:15 pm on 2/23/21 and she waited in the pharmacy recovery area for the full 15 minute time.  Patient called the pharmacy after she had just returned home (around 7 pm) and said her throat felt funny and she had a metallic taste in her mouth.  Confirmed no difficulty breathing at that point, but that her throat felt a &#34;little thick&#34;.    As patient was already at home and not near the pharmacy area, recommended that she immediately go to ER to be seen as felt the delay of driving back to potentially get epi injection and then be sent to ER could be detrimental to the patient.  She confirmed that she would head to the nearest ER.

Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head.

I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time.

                                                Severe chills. Could not move body for one hour. Whole body hurt for hour and a half. Thirst. Finally went back to sleep. Morning had a severe migraine. Took Tylenol and a nap and I felt my fever break.  Had that fever from 4am until 11:30am. Had headache for the rest of the day until 7pm but was not a migraine after the nap and Tylenol. I would never get this vaccine again. I would rather have covid 1000 more times. (I had it in October and no sickness I?ve ever had will ever compare to that two hours of hell.

                                                Patient reported symptoms of: tachycardia, shakiness, vision changes, tongue numbness and shortness of breath following the first dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine on 2/5/2021. Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

Withing one hour throat tightness resolved, respiratory rate reamined normal, left eye swelling was improving and nodule to forehead was decreasing in size. Floaters were persistent. 24 hours later pt reports no recurrence of throat tightness, normal respiratory rate, resolution of left eye swelling, some decrease in size of forehead nodule. Floaters have been persistent and unchanged.   *24 hours after second vaccine pt has onset of palpable lymph nodes to anterior cervical chain, single node to left supraclavicular chain and left axillary swelling. This was not considered an allergic reaction and attributed to immune response to vaccine.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                Nerve pain throughout the entire body lasting approximately 18 hours. Felt like ants crawling through all my muscles. Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

She was took to the immunization room where she was unable to sit in a chair and was helped to to lie down.  She had  blank look on her face for a couple of seconds and then started looking around slightly confused then started talking again.  She laid there for about 5 minutes and started to feel better so she sat on the chair for about 5 minutes before EMT&#39;s arrived as a precaution.  After getting check out she left on her own accord. She stated while talking that when she gave blood in the past this has happened.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

The day after this subsided I started to get extremely itchy rashes on my neck that would come and go.  This has continued to occur. Exactly one week after the vaccine was given my lips began to swell up and become numb, again this went away with time.

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                Since the day of the vaccine, I have had a change in taste. Whenever I eat meat or anything savory, it tastes like gasoline. Some other things taste funny too. It began with my toothpaste, so I just thought it was a bad tube. After buying a new brand of toothpaste, I discovered that it was my tastebuds that were off. Toothpaste and anything minty or savory I once loved eating now tastes like gasoline smells. Once loved smells from cooking food are also unbearable now.  Most sweet foods still taste the same, though and are good.

After 3 hours, I threw up, lost my ability to walk on my own, and briefly lost my vision (5 seconds).

Never before did I encounter these effects from alcohol when consuming 1-1.5 drinks per hour.   The next day I felt very tired, sluggish, and run down all day long.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 17:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated her daughter received her first Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 5:30 pm. The patient&#39;s signs and symptoms began shortly after receiving the shot. That evening at 19:00, she had very itchy eyes, the next morning (07Jan2021) she woke up with swollen eyes, a rash on her forehead, around her eyes and both cheeks. She took benedryl and zyrtec on 07Jan2021. The symptoms clear up by 10Jan2021, following a visit to her HCP, on 08Jan2021. She received a steroid shot, a prednisone dose pack her HCP. Her HCP recommended she not take dose 2 and instructed her mother to call Pfizer for recommendations. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021.  The  reporting nurse considered the case as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events of swollen eyes, itching eyes and rash on face were likely related to first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), due to plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL1283, expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Jan2021 at 19:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was reported as the hospital. The patient had no medical history; she had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On Monday, 25Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient woke up with a bad headache and congestion and it worsened up until Tuesday. It felt like a really bad sinus infection. Then on Tuesday night, 26Jan2021, the patient lost her smell and she was also extremely tired. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. The patient was not recovered from all the events.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine around 12:30 pm. At around 4:00 pm, I noticed that my lips were slightly swollen. I went and bought liquid Benadryl. At around 5:45 pm, I took 20ml of the liquid Benadryl. I proceeded to sleep the rest of the night. I woke up around 8:20 am the next morning and noticed that my lips were significantly more swollen. I took 20ml more of the liquid Benadryl and noticed that my tongue was a little swollen as well. At around 9:40 am, I took 20ml more of liquid Benadryl.  I noticed no change in my swelling and my throat started to feel like there was a lump. At around 10:20 am,  I drove to the emergency room. The doctor noticed swelling in my lips and some in my tongue and throat. I was given cimetidine and methylprednisolone through an IV, which reduced the swelling. I was discharged 2 hours later after the swelling went down and was given 2 prescriptions to take the next 4 days, which were prednisone 20mg  (three tablets once a day) and famotidine 20mg (twice a day). There is some swelling in my lips in the morning (for the last two days) until I take the steroids, then it reduces the swelling. The overall cost of the emergency room visit was $1669.17.

                                                Fever of 102 and dehydration contributed to a syncope collapse early the morning after vaccination (7:15 AM  02/20/21). Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

                                                I had tested positive with covid in the ending of December after the holidays. With that I lost my sense of taste and smell. Fast foward, on Monday Feb. 22nd I received the second dose to the covid vaccine, on Friday I was eating tacos and I got this taste in my mouth and my stomach was bothering me I believe from the tacos beings bad (2 other people got sick too) but the taste lingers, The next morning I cook breakfast and lunch and I can smell this smell that I taste as well. It is not March 4th, 1 day shy of it being a week and I am still experiencing this. I can not taste any food flavor except this taste that I have, it has replaced all food flavors and smells. Whenever I cook something I can smell the scent I taste (only when Its food or Im cooking, I can smell my coconut lotion and body spray just fine). I do not know how to describe it I started describing it as it being an old grease taste but it could be a metallic taste I am not sure, all I know it is a very unpleasant taste. Whenever I brush my teeth, immediately when I put the toothpaste in my mouth i immediately taste the taste again its like it almost heightens it. The taste lingers in my mouth after that as well. I do have to say that I tried a chocolate covered pretzels and m&amp;m&#39;s and notices that I can taste sweet stuff but immediately get the taste when I eat regular foods thats are not sweet. I tried to eat waffles one time and the syrup taste was fine but I could not eat sausage because of the taste. This is very frustrating because its disgusting that I would rather not taste anything at all. I am unsure if my taste was ever fully back after having covid I was able to start tasting things but not sure if it was 100% as well as I could smell somethings but  not sure if that was 100%. I talked to some people who thought maybe it is my senses trying to fully come back because they heard about people experiencing weird smells when their senses were coming back but I am unsure I just want to not deal with this anymore. I think its weird it came 3 days after the vaccine and that I can not taste food other than this taste.

In the following 10 to 15 minutes my lips started tingling and my throat started to tighten up. The itching finally stopped after 10 minutes. The tingling in my lips and throat tightening occurred with both the first and second dose. The staff kept me for around 45-50 minutes for both doses of the vaccine.  When going home I took 2 Benadryl.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

This lasted about 5 days and slowly got better. My taste would be ok in the morning then would go away again in the afternoon. I had two telehealth visit and they had me tested for COVID, I tested negative. I tested again a few days later and was negative again. My Doctor said it was most likely a viral infection.

Her condition worsened to feeling nauseous and blurred vision, so patient asked to lie down.  We found a quiet area in the employee break room for the patient to lay down.  and provided her a pillow, water, cool compress for her head, and later, orange juice for her comfort. We proceeded to call 911 for medical attention. EMS professionals evaluated patient&#39;s vital signs and patient signed waiver refusing to go to hospital, since she was feeling better. Patient left on her own accord with a friend driving her home.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins because after my first shot my arm ended up VERY swollen and I had a rash. So I was okay after the 30 minutes but when I started driving I felt like I was high on strong drugs. Like as if I?d taken an extremely strong marajuana edible and it just hit me. I had to pull over because my eyes wouldn?t stay open, my whole body was feeling very heavy and I was extremely tired and out of it. I didn?t have another way to get home (I had traveled about an hour) so I just kept driving and taking 15 min rests along the way. When I got home I fell asleep as soon as I sat down and slept for about four hours. I feel better now that I?m awake, still light headed but not near as bad.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

I also began to feel a soreness in the back of my throat and my ears. Mild fatigue was also observed. Around 2am, 14 hours following the injection, I woke up with whole body muscle aches and a mild fever. Mild fatigue, muscle soreness and arm soreness continued into the next day.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

I also have noticed that I am not able to taste some feeds as strongly as before. I haven?t lost those senses but they have changed slightly. Nothing too impactful or serious though. My second dose is coming up on 2/8.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I felt extremely lightheaded, eyes were blurry for 5-10 minutes, and extreme sweating all over my body. These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

                                                While waiting in after the vaccination I experience the slightest discomfort with my breathing but thought it might be related to double masking. Upon driving home, I realized I had non-itchy and non-painful hives on the upper portion of my right cheek and the lower jaw on the left side. As time progressed, the hives disappeared from left side and moved down the right side of my face. After it passed on the right side it reappeared on the left side and followed the same pattern. My dermatographia also returned on my chest and I haven&#39;t had an episode of it for over year. The roof of my mouth was also itchy. All hives, itchy mouth, and slight breathing discomfort passed by 7 pm without the use of an antihistamine. No other signs of allergic reaction has been noted since. Breathing concerns passed the quickest (after 2 or so hours), then itchy mouth, and last the non-itchy hives. Other than that, I experienced the common side effect of body aches during the night and pain in vaccinated arm.

                                                It started when I woke up and my eyelids were severely swollen. Then throughout the day the swelling started to go down but then my neck began getting red. I then developed a light rash on my neck, chest, and arms. The only part that was slightly itching was my neck. I continued to take Benadryl and used cortisone cream on my neck. I woke up the next day with my eyelids being swollen again. Benadryl helped. The rash is going down and all I have left is a rash on my left wrist which developed on the 4th day after my vaccine.

Started having intense chest pain around 10 AM- felt like pressure on my chest and almost squeezing, it kind of shot out and I could feel it in my throat and in my headache.

Nausea, dizziness, haziness, and headache were on and off the rest of the day, subsiding around 6 PM.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

                                                From 3:00pm on 1/8 to the morning of 1/12, experienced high fevers, severe body aches, chills, fatigue, night sweats, and headache. My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

After about 36 hours it had resolved itself. strange feeling that I can best describe as &#34;trippy&#34; - lasted from about two hours after the vaccine until I went to bed that night - The cheese I ate with dinner tasted abnormally strong, I kept feeling like everything around me was moving even though it wasn&#39;t (felt like the floor / walls were moving - similar to when I&#39;m super tired and / or severely jet lagged), and somehow colors seemed a little off.  When I woke up the next morning this &#34;trippy&#34; feeling was gone.

The muscles in my lips were not working, and I had a hard time speaking. I could force a smile if I tried really hard, but if I was relaxed, the corners of my mouth were low on my face, and my mouth hung open.  It lasted about 5 minutes and over a minute faded back to normal. I went to urgent care after speaking with a triage nurse.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

The day prior to testing positive I had been notified that I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. I did not have any symptoms when I tested positive on 12/28/20 except for a headache later that night. The next day I felt fatigued and had nasal congestion. On 12/30/20, i noticed that I had lost my sense of smell and my sense of taste was altered. I also felt mild chest tightness however my o2 sats remained above 95%. The congestion and fatigue only lasted for two days and my sense of smell and taste had come back by 1/1/21. The chest tightness has persisted even now after testing negative but has diminished over time and occurs less frequently.

My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                I have been experiencing high blood pressure between about 140/90 and 130/85 with headaches and tinnitus. Blood pressure remains high throughout the day and was first noticed on 03/20/2021. I first took my blood pressure after noticing a mild headache that was not alleviated with hydration or OTC pain medication. Headaches have returned intermittently since 03/20/2021 but now only lasts 1-2 hours. Tinnitus was noticed several weeks ago (specific date is unknown) and is a mild and quiet but constant high frequency ringing. Unsure if any of these are related but I have never had tinnitus and my blood pressure is not this high nor do I have headaches often or back-to-back.

After my second dose my arm initially didn?t hurt but started to hurt hours later. I had cough and sore throat but the worse thing was I woke up with super puffy red eyes with green discharge coming out. I was fine until I got the Pfizer vaccine. The morning after I felt terrible. I called my doctor to see what he can do or prescribe for my eyes.
