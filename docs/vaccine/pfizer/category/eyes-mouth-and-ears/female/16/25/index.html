                                                Patient is a 16yo seen for her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. She was seated in the back seat of the car. Shortly after receiving her vaccine (within a few minutes), she chose to move to the front passenger seat of the car, and after sitting in the passenger seat she became lightheaded and lost consciousness. Syncopal event was witnessed and lasted a few seconds. She spontaneously regained consciousness, and complained of some lightheadedness and tunnel vision. No significant confusion was noted, her responses to questions were appropriate. Initial pulse was thready and heart rate initially difficult to auscultate. Pale color noted on the face. Initial pulse approximately 50bpm. Breath sounds clear with good air exchange. Patient was placed in a reclined position with feet on the dash.  She quickly recovered and repeat heart rate was auscultated at approximately 70bpm, stronger pulse noted. She was noted to have improvement and she was then driven out of the vaccine site after obtaining consent from her mother (who was the driver) and parked beside EMS. BP was 100/50 and HR 68-72, SaO2 97%.  Lightheadedness resolved and she was feeling well, at her baseline.  She was monitored for 30 min then allowed to leave with her mother, she was at her baseline at last evaluation. Per history review with her mother, she has had 2 prior episodes of syncope with pin removal from hand after surgery and IV placement.

Her reflexes were 2&#43; in her BL UE and LEs.  Pediatric Neurology and ophthalmology consulted and followed patient. Eye exam remarkable for bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsy but no other element of CN3 palsy and bilateral dilated but unreactive pupils. Patient treated with IVIG 1mg/kg/day x2 days for likely miller fisher syndrome variant of Guillain-Barre.

She was alert shortly thereafter but had blurry vision and low blood pressure.  She said she was very hot and was sweating somewhat.  We gave her some water and gradually she started feeling better.  In the meantime, we had call 911 and when they evaluated her, they felt it was somewhat of a panic attack since she did have anxiety before getting the vaccine.

                                                Pt. received her second Pfizer dose at 3pm. By 11:30pm she had significant swelling on both of her eyes, mouth, and the start of red splotchy skin on arms and legs. We took her to ER. They gave her 50mg of hydroxizine and sent us home. 5min after leaving the ER at 12:30am on 4/23 she felt a golf ball sized lump in her throat and was having difficulty breathing. We brought her back to the ER.  At this time they gave her an ekg, and at around 1:30am gave her an epi pin and an oral steroid. Within 5min of the oral steroid and epi pin she no longer had difficulty in breathing and the lump in her throat was gone as was the res splotches. By 5am the swelling in her face had reduced drastically to 90% normal in her left eye and 70% normal in her right eye and 70% normal in her lip. She was released from the ER at 5:45am and went home to sleep. At 11:30am on 4/23 her swelling in her face remains the same and she is complaining of a headache. She was given 50mg more of hydroxizine.

                                                After RN administered vaccine she spoke to my daughter for some time afterwards 5-6 minutes and my daughter was fine answering her questions and just visiting with her. She directed us to the table to schedule her second vaccine which was directly in front of us. We went to this table and spoke with two other ladies choosing a date and time and she was also fine talking with them and answering questions of eat time offered and then suddenly she went straight back with warning passed completely out and struck the back of her head on the concrete floor. EMS and RN?s who were there went to her aid immediately and she was unconscious for a little over a minute. They initially couldn?t get her to respond and finally she came to and had no idea what happened and no recollection of falling. She had blurred vision and bleeding a bit from the back of her head and they wanted her to have CT of her head after hitting it that hard. They took her by ambulance to hospital and they assessed her and ordered a CT. The CT thankfully came back clear and she has follow up appointment with concussion doctor first thing in the morning. On discharge she was describing her pain from hitting head a 7/10 It was very scary and everyone around us was visibly upset as well. She has never fainted or had a reaction to any other shot, vaccine or needle before today so that was a very unusual reaction.

The COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech 0.3mL administered IM in right deltoid while patient was sitting. Patient remained sitting for 10 minutes after administered dose. Patient reported feeling well after the injection. Patient stood up while we continued to talk, after 2 more minutes passed out while standing. Suddenly, patient begain to go limp and her eyes crossed and rolled back. Patient fell backwards into the privacy curtain and into aisle 13 of the store. Patient&#39;s head bounced off the floor. Immunizer  knelt next to patient. Patient was unresponsive until immunizer placed cold hand on back of neck and front of chest to check if she was breathing, immunizer calmly  guided patient to breath, slow deep breaths into the belly and patient&#39;s eyes fluttered open. She said her head hurt really bad. Immunizer offered to the accompanying adult to call EMS because patient should be evaluated after hitting her head so hard. The accompanying adult denyed EMS, then stating that patient had previously fainted while walking and said that she would be fine. Immunizer advised patient to remain laying down while immunizer got some ice. Ice was then placed on the back of the head. Patient slowly stood up after laying for 10 minutes and was walked over to a sitting area to put feet up and continue with ice for another 5 minutes before the accomanying adult wanted to leave.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

Her eyes rolled back and up then her head fell backward.  I supported her head and her dad was checking her for awareness.  I gave her a bottle of water and she drank some of it.  She indicated that her vision was still not accurate.  Her dad brought her a candy bar and she ate the majority of it and drank the majority of the contents of the water bottle.   We gave her a few more minutes to feel comfortable then I asked whether she was ready to stand up.  She was not.  We gave her a bag of chips and she ate some and finished the water bottle.  After a few more minutes, she stood up and was able to walk without assistance.     Her father indicated that she had an incident like this before, but patient did not remember the previous incident.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine. Patient left to sit in out waiting room after vaccine. Patient&#39;s mother informed in a few minutes that the patient was not feeling well. She stated that the patient felt hot. I grabbed an ice pack on my way out to her. I put the ice pack behind her neck. Patient passed out within a minute of me getting to the patient. She came back to quickly and stated that she was having a hard time seeing and hearing. She then again passes out. At this point I made the decision to call 911. I delegated to my tech to call 911.  She called 911.  I asked my other tech to come help me thinking the patient my have needed to be lower to the ground. The patient again regained consciousness.  At this point I asked tech to call our Store Director and inform them. I also asked that she get me a water for the patient. The patient was feeling better and drank some water. She then again passes out. This time we were struggling to get her to regain consciousness. I used sternal rubs to help the patient regain consciousness. I was having a hard time finding her pulse. This lasted for a minute or two and then she stared responding. Right then EMS arrived and took over. I gave them the information I had and they took her vitals. EMS decided that she was stable and could go home to be monitored by mom. I did call the Mother the next morning to check on the patient. The patient did well last night and was feeling good this morning.

I took my blood pressure and the reading was 120/71 with a pulse of 54 which is really low. I went to the Dr. to be evaluated. Dr. felt it was a vasovagal response. I will continue to monitor myself and if it continues, I will see a cardiologist.

Then again Mother checked on daughter later on and daughter was unresponsive when mom was tapping her in the face-she was just looking at her mom but not seeing or hearing her -like a black out-- couldnt be woken up easily- and when she did wake she couldn&#39;t see.  But since those 2 episodes daughter&#39;s sight is back but she feels nauseous and has an upset stomach.

She fell out of her chair, her eyes fluttered and rolled in the back of her head, her teeth were clocking and chattering and her body was shaking mildly. She lost consciousness for approximately 2 minutes. At 8:33 pm she felt a second seizure begin, her step father grabbed her before she could fall and again, her eyes fluttered and rolled in back of her head, her teeth were clicking and chattering and her whole body was shaking. The second episode lasted approximately 2 minutes as well, with her losing consciousness again. She was taken to the emergency room and stayed overnight for observation.

We called the EMTs and we advised the patient that syncope is something we have seen in children receiving the vaccine and the EMTs advised of the same thing. They took her vitals all normal and the patient began to see the symptoms disappear. The patient once better and cleared by EMTs went home per their advise.

                                                atient was in for 2nd covid-19 (Pfizer lot was EW0167, exp 8/31/2021):  It was her and her brother receiving the vaccine. Brother went first and was fine. She was second. After receiving the vaccine (~30-60sec) she appeared to lose conciseness (not sure if complete or partial) she said she didn&#39;t remember all of it, but it was more like a dream. During that she had some twitches/spams (involving circular motions with her arms and leg, leg extended and then retracted, but her head rolled back). Upon coming out/waking she appeared sensitive to light and was nauseous. Left her in the room with her mom to get an ice pack, water, paper towel. Total episode lasted less than a minute, but took about 10-15 minutes (estimate, unsure of full time spent) before she felt good enough to use a wheelchair and get in her mom&#39;s car to drive home.

The noise seemed to vary in volume and intensity and by ear...sometimes in both but sometimes just in one. The sound seemed to get quieter as she approached her second vaccine, but when she got the second dose on May 21, the symptoms and reactions returned and intensified.

She couldn?t see and it seemed like it was a Vaso Vagal response which resolved quickly. At 5am the woke up with a fever of 102 and extreme left arm pain. The fever was controlled with Tylenol. Two days after the vaccine she woke up complaining of chest pain and a knot under her left arm. It felt like something was pressing on her chest. We went to the ER and all tests were negative. The feeling lasted until the end of the day. Three days after the shot the next morning she got a headache  for half of the day and resolved with Tylenol. The next day all symptoms were gone.

We went to Emergency room on Friday and they gave her an IV with Antihistamine and Steroids and Pepcid.  She got better and we went home.  She broke out again all over her body on Saturday and this time we went to Emergnecy room.  They observed her and basically told us when they discharged us to keep her on Benadryl every four hours for the next 48 hours.    I think it&#39;s important to note that she did test positive for COVID 19 on December 11, 2020 and had a fairly mild case of the virus.  ALso, that she has never had this reaction to anything ever before.

                                                Patient not seen in office.  History obtained via phone from father of patient and patient herself.  Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

                                                about 5 minutes after administration, patient became unresponsive and was going in and out of consciousness. Her pupils became dilated and she would not respond to stimuli. Her respiratory status was unclear. No hives or rash could be observed. Patient became pale in the face. An allergic reaction could not be ruled out and the patient became less responsive so an EpiPen 0.3mg was administered in the left thigh. Patient was placed on her back on the ground. She became more alert and seemed to have normal breathing. EMS arrived and took vitals. Blood pressure was 138/77 with a heart rate of 88 bpm. Patient&#39;s father is taking her to her PCP for follow up this afternoon.

There was a loud ringing in my ears and everything else sounded muffled. I felt dizzy and my skin felt like tissue paper.  It faded after I went inside and got water. However, I still have a headache, 6 hours later.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

Her mom was with her. Her mom had already given her a snack when I was notified. Pt stated her vision was blurry and her hearing was &#34;like she was in a tunnel&#34;. She was feeling cold and was feeling scared of that feeling. I asked if I could apply a cold pack and asked her to rest the back of her head against the wall and to close her eyes. I applied the cold pack to her forehead and observed her. She started to sweat and was calmer. She was feeling better and her hearing and vision was back to normal. I had her wait for a total of 30 minutes and had my technician stay with her at that time. She was feeling better and I asked her mom to hang on to her while walking to their car. I followed up with the patient 4 hours later and she was doing well. She said she was feeling well and her arm was not even sore just some fatigue.

                                                Less than 1 minute after received the shot, patient became clammy and pale while sitting in chair. Her eyes rolled back in her head and her body went slack. Myself (parent) and the nurse who had given the shot braced her on either side while she appeared to fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes (she seemed to occasionally interact with us, mumbling responses to &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; questions). The nurse did not want to lower her to the floor, but wanted to keep her propped on the chair. Her head kept rolling to the side. At one point, she began to jerk rhythmically.  Just as I was about to bring this to the attention of the nurse, the patient returned to consciousness. Patient was moved to a rolling recliner chair and taken to a recovery area where I (parent) did not see her for another 30 minutes as I was receiving my own shot. The chair she had sat in was wet, but it was assumed this was due to sweat (patient had sweated profusely).  On the way out of the clinic, noticing a wet stain on the back side of patient&#39;s pants, I asked if she had wet her pants (quietly) two separate times. Patient denied it both times. However, upon returning home, patient confirmed that she had wet her pants.  Patient was monitored during the evening for similar adverse events ; none noted.  Patient ate lunch approximately 1 hour before receiving shot and was given crackers while at clinic. Patient is a well-hydrated individual, and also drank water while on-site. No fever either before or after shot. A slightly elevated BP the next day (135/83). However, patient complained of headache, fatigue, and pain at injection location; elevated BP may be related to headache and/or ordeal from day of the shot.

Mom at pts side and sts pt first passed out at the age of 4 years old when she witnessed her father having blood drawn for a health screen.   She also reportedly passed out after receiving a vaccine at Pharmacy in 2017.  Due to her history of injection related syncopal episodes, pt is placed in a supine position on the cot as precaution. Approximately 30 seconds after receiving the injection, the pt was witnessed becoming unresponsive by this HCP.  Pt was then witnessed having her eyes roll up and back followed by a  few seconds of generalized seizure activity.  HCP remains at pts side.  The cot has a suspended cloth and is soft, therefore, pt is safe from harm on it.   Seizure ends after seconds and pt awakens.  She is initially confused but orients quickly.  She remains AOX4 and has no complaints.  Spoke with mom extensively about pts condition and presenting symptoms.  VS- HR initially 52 but quickly improves to 77, BP 107/64, RR 16, sats 98%.

                                                Approximately two minutes after vaccine injection, pt started to feel dizzy, saw spots, felt like she was going to pass out. Someone got a wheelchair and we took her back to observation/treatment area. Patient was very drowsy, felt nauseous, hands were tingling, and was cold and clammy.  We asked her to text her Mom, who was sitting out in the parking lot, to have her come inside.  Pt reported passing out with HPV vaccine and on blood draws.  We moved patient to pt bed and took vitals (listed below).  Patient was able to recover without any medication administration under close observation.  After about 20 mins in obs/treatment area, she was feeling better and we moved her to the observation room with her Mom.  We had leftover vaccine syringes, so Mom received her first dose of vaccine.  They waited together until Mom&#39;s 15 mn obs time was over.  Patient and someone left the clinic feeling fine and under their own power around 1845.

At 20 minutes post-vaccination, patient began feeling her throat tightening, tongue swelling, and stated that her lips/mouth/tongue had a tingling sensation. At this point she was taken to the nurse/paramedic to be monitored with EKG, pulse oximetry, and given a bottle of water to drink. After 30 minutes of monitoring, the nurse/paramedic asked patient if her symptoms were improving and if she felt well enough to go home.  She said that her symptoms were not gone, but improving, so she was told to sign a waiver/refusal of care form and released. However, at 11 hours post vaccination (1:30 AM), the symptoms returned (tongue swelling, throat tightening, tingling sensation in and around her mouth).  I administered Benadryl (2 tablets), monitored for 30 minutes, and symptoms improved.   No further symptoms after that point.

                                                On 5/9 at approx 8 or 9pm patient started experiencing a severe headache. Given her history of allergies and angioedema, I had her take 25 mg of oral Benadryl in addition to 500mg of Tylenol. This morning (5/10) when she woke up her upper lip was severely swollen. This sometimes happens with her angioedema, but it is always unilateral, stopping abruptly at midline. This time the swelling was bilateral, involving the entire upper lip, and was more severe than she has ever experienced. She took 240mg Allegra and 40mg Prednisone per MD instructions. Swelling started improving in the afternoon. Patient has known triggers for angioedema, but had none recently, nor had she experienced any angioedema in the last few months.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced rash on 27Apr2021, itching on 28Apr2021, tongue is numb and tingling on 27Apr2021, allergic reaction on 27Apr2021, she thought it was acne at first, but at the injection site she broke out on 27Apr2021, rashes on both arms/saw other red dots appear on 27Apr2021. Clarified allergic reaction as: She thought it was acne at first, but at the injection site she broke out. She has rashes on both arms. Rash seems to be spreading. Really started to show on day two and day three. Hasn&#39;t taken anything for it. She tends to break out on her arms, that&#39;s just her own body, but she saw other red dots appear that hadn&#39;t been there on her arms. She was itching last night and that was new. Is not itching as of now. She went to the hospital and was told to take Benadryl. Clarified she went to the vaccination facility, which was the hospital, and she was asked what was going on. She was not a patient of the ER and was not admitted to the hospital. Forgot to mention her tongue has been numb and tingling for a couple of days. First noticed it when she had something cold, but has persisted even without drinking something cold. Started Tuesday, 27Apr2021, night. Wondering if that is a side effect. Read in the pamphlet it is part of an allergic reaction. Read that rash is a part of a severe reaction.Outcome of all events was not recovered.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events.

                                                Patient given vaccination ID unclear if this was the LOT number. She developed a mild skin rash one day after vaccination, which spread over her face, neck and chest and arms, with lip swelling, but no other oropharyngeal edema. The rash was itchy and pruritic, raised macules that were slightly erythemaic on the face, and sparsely papular on the arms.  We prescribed benadryl and prednisone, with instructions to call our service line and also see us in the office on Monday.  She had unresolved blood tests, hyperglycemia,  which we were trying manage with our staff however she was not adherent to follow up with us due to college coursework.   My associate is her primary care attending, and had requested assistance in filling out the VAERS form.

Patient called the pharmacy after she had just returned home (around 7 pm) and said her throat felt funny and she had a metallic taste in her mouth.  Confirmed no difficulty breathing at that point, but that her throat felt a &#34;little thick&#34;.    As patient was already at home and not near the pharmacy area, recommended that she immediately go to ER to be seen as felt the delay of driving back to potentially get epi injection and then be sent to ER could be detrimental to the patient.  She confirmed that she would head to the nearest ER.

                                                Awoke the next morning with severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain (?felt Like being hit by a truck?). Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head. That happened for about 4 minutes or so sometimes it would happen like 3 or 4 times in a row and sometimes it would be every 20 seconds or so. I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

I examined patients tongue and it did not appear swollen. Patient denied and shortness of breath or trouble swallowing. Patient states she had a reaction in the past to a medication that caused severe swelling of her tongue in which she now has a prescription for epi pens Vital signs were taken and were normal (BP 110/70, HR 80, O2 SAT 100%).

She did state she has a history of fainting from taking blood, so it&#39;s possible she fainted. She was feeling light headed and woozy and her ears were ringing just before the episode. I asked her if she wanted me to call 911 and she said no because when it had happened in the past, she had been fine. I took her blood pressure and it was 95/52. She waited in the area till 12:25 and I took her blood pressure again and it was 115/60.  She did not have any other incindent. She left with her companion. I called her at 1:27p.

After about two, my left arm began to get extremely hot and I called the nurse in the room over. I began to ask her if it was a normal side effect and began to lose my vision and hearing while talking. I passed out and was wheeling to the side of the room where the doctor was. Upon waking up (after 2/3 minutes) I threw up. The doctor took vitals and such and said everything looked okay. After about 15 minutes I was able to stand and head home.

                                                Upon resting later the day of my vaccine at home, my left arm because extremely painful and sore. Which I found to be normal and expected. However, I became very exhausted suddenly and ended up falling asleep 2-3 hours before my normal bedtime.  I woke up 12 hours later unable to motivate myself to get out of bed. Finally, I did and went to go take a shower. I had chills as soon as I got out of bed and had to sit down in the shower for 10 minutes out of exhaustion and had the water running extremely hot but I was still cold. My arm was still in extreme pain. Finally, I arose from the shower floor and began showering when I started to feel as if I was going to puke right away. I laid down in the shower quickly becoming dizzy, and tried to puke. I dry heaved once to no avail. Immediately after dry heaving, my ears went numb and the shower noise was barely audible. My hands went completely numb. Home alone, I knew I needed to get out of the shower before I passed out. I managed to step out of the shower before immediately falling and possibly blacking out for some seconds and fell to the floor and laid there for a minute. Finally, I was somehow able to grab a towel and struggle to my bedroom and laid there numb for about 10 minutes.  This episode ended at about noon but for the rest of the day, I had to sleep on and off, it exhausted me to try and eat,  I had hot flashes, more dizziness, arm pain, and nausea. I called the doctor and they said there was nothing they could do and my symptoms were normal since I had COVID-19 in December.

History is consistent with vasovagal syncopal episode given resolution of symptoms in a quick period of time. Must also consider anaphylactic reaction to vaccine given patient had vomiting and low blood pressures following vaccine administration. However, this is less likely given that patient returned to baseline blood pressures without any additional interventions and has had no additional episodes of vomiting since presenting to the emergency department. Must also consider pregnancy given vomiting and recent Plan B usage

My eyes unfocused, I got slightly nauseous, I went absent, and my heart raced. I couldn?t focus the rest of the night I felt very off and strange. It was very sudden and scary. I shook for like 30 minutes after. It has been happening on and off in very short durations for four days now.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out.

I advised her to sit and I would get help.  as I turned she was standing next to me holding her chest saying she isnt feeling right.  they put her on a bed and was looking for a blood pressure cuff.  they placed a pulseox on her finger which showed 100.  then they placed another clip on her other finger and it showed her heart rate increasing to 138 from 93 in seconds. her face was red her neck was red and she said her heart was racing.   they finally found a BP cuff and her blood pressure was 148/94 which they said this was normal.  it was not. they they told us to seek medical attention.  She continued to complain about chest pain and racing and her face and next continued to be red.  the nurse then gave her 50ml of benadryl with no relief.  She was taking out by wheelchair to a waiting ambulance then to the Hospital Emergency Room.  They treated her with a Steroid and IV.  She was released after about 3 hours.  we came home and 2 hours later went back to the same Emergency room for the same chest pain and racing  at which point  she now had a rash on chest and neck.  this time they gave her medicine to slow down her heart which made her feel better.  she was then released.   Since then she continues to have heart papatations and rashes, and a heard time swallowing with a continue feeling something is stuck in her throat.

                                                Patient stood to approach her father, when she slumped over and lost consciousness and was unarousable. She had normal breathing and pulse. The clinical team transferred patient to the Assessment Tent, where she was observed to have seizure-like jerking of her upper &amp; lower extremities and fluttering of the eyelids while she remained unconscious. She had normal pulse and respiration during this time, no tongue biting or urinary or stool incontinence. Within approximately 10 minutes her seizure-like movements resolved, and she gradually regained consciousness. I spoke with the patient afterwards: she recalls having stood to meet with her father, and then she has no recollection of the event.

Went to ER. Was given a COVID test (awaiting results at this time) as well as some muscular shots of Toradol, Benadryl &amp; Reglan. Felt better within 30 mins and was discharged to go home.

The next day, I woke up around 10:30am and was sore until about 12pm when I began to feel completely awful. I was tired and no pain reliever helped with the muscle aches in my shoulders and back. I felt like my chest was being weighed down and it felt like a horrible chore to even breathe. About 24 hours after the shot, under my jaws began to hurt terribly and ice didn&#39;t do much to help it. I finally fell asleep on 04/28 around 2am and woke up on 04/29 without any pain.

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. However, the information provided is very limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment. Case will be reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                We left the store and got a bite to eat at the drive through. After driving about 7 minutes she grabbed her throat and started acting like she was not able to swallow. I asked her was she ok? She stated no in a raspy voice. She shook her head and said she felt like molasses was in her throat. She seemed pale and began to sweat. I am a former EMT-Parmamedic. I remembered there was a store about 2 miles away. I called  and got the Pharmacist on the phone. I ran into the  after driving 92 miles an hour and she converted children&#39;s Benadryl for me and stayed on the phone. I gave her 1/2 a bottle. began to be more responsive. I had a medical bag with me with airways and other medical devices I use for work but no Epi Pen. After giving her all the Benadryl she said she felt better but she stayed hoarse for the remainder of the day and was sleepy. I kept an eye on her an Called her physician on Monday morning as this was a Saturday and they called in Epi pens in case this happens again. The first shot she felt like she swallowed a potato chip wrong and started acting the same way then through up but never got this bad. We just thought she ate something and it went down the wrong way. Never giving it a second thought. Then after the second shot it was much worse. Had I not the pharmacist on the phone, Benadryl liquid and a medical bag, I would have called an ambulance. In the county we live in though we do not have enough ambulances and I am afraid she would have went into full anaphylaxis and died. I did what I thought was the best for my only child.

                                                hypokalemia (2.9 mmol/L); hypocalcemia (6.4 mg/dL); puffy eyes; respiratory symptoms; possibly stridor; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 19-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included food allergy, anaphylactic reaction. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient woke up the next morning on 20May2021 with puffy eyes and respiratory symptoms (possibly stridor) and self-administered epinephrine, then was taken to the nearest ED where she received additional epi and albuterol. Those symptoms eventually subsided, but what triggered the study stop was her lab findings consisting of hypokalemia (2.9 mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (6.4 mg/dL). In the AE grading scale that the study is using (the FDA&#39;s scale used in vaccination studies), these values are considered Grade 4 As such, we met the study stopping rule of a single Grade 4 event and since they were detected one day after vaccination, the site PI indicated that they could be &#34;possibly related&#34; to the vaccine. These abnormalities were promptly corrected and the participant is doing OK, based on the most recent update. There is no report that the reporter could identify that these electrolyte abnormalities are vaccine related and I am contacting you to confirm that this is, indeed, the case. We believe other explanations should be considered (e.g. epinephrine plus beta agonist administration can lead to both hypokalemia and hypocalcemia through beta2 effects; alternatively, or in addition, hyperventilation could result in respiratory alkalosis that has similar effects). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood calcium: 6.4 mg/dl on an unspecified date Hypocalcemia , blood potassium: 2.9 mmol/l on an unspecified date Hypokalemia.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of puffy eyes, respiratory symptoms, possibly stridor. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information regarding lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported puffy eyes and respiratory symptoms (possibly stridor) and the use of bnt162b2 is possible. Considering that these events likely occurred under the context of an allergic reaction based on the temporal association and the positive response to epinephrine and albuterol. The patient also has a history of food allergy, anaphylactic reaction which place the patient at risk.  As for the events , hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, agree with the reporter that the use of the beta 2 agonist , as well as the respiratory alkalosis explain the occurrence of these events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Immediate Reaction (onset &lt;5 min) associated with the following symptoms:  ? Visible swelling and pain at the injection site  ? Increased nasal secretions and eye tearing ? Chills Around 30 minutes after, she had also developed: ? Swelling of the tongue (felt &#34;heavy&#34;) ? Flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea, followed later by vomiting ? Dizziness/lightheadedness/weakness ? Dyspnea, wheezing, and cough ? Hives on arms and chest    No throat tightening or tachypnea. She did not attempt speech.  No one in the clinic took her blood pressure or pulse ox   The patient brought her epi pen with her but elected not to use it. Left after 30 minute observation period.  Thinks that the people at the vaccine clinic did not recognize that she had hives because of her dark complexion.  The people administering vaccines were not medically trained    Patient&#39;s mom recognized that she was not feeling well when she picked her up.  She took benadryl which helped with allergy symptoms.  She then developed fever up to 102.3, chills, headache, nausea, and myalgias x 5 days

Morning had a severe migraine. Took Tylenol and a nap and I felt my fever break.  Had that fever from 4am until 11:30am. Had headache for the rest of the day until 7pm but was not a migraine after the nap and Tylenol. I would never get this vaccine again. I would rather have covid 1000 more times. (I had it in October and no sickness I?ve ever had will ever compare to that two hours of hell.

                                                Patient reported symptoms of: tachycardia, shakiness, vision changes, tongue numbness and shortness of breath following the first dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine on 2/5/2021. Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

                                                Part one: Within one minute of injection, I was extremely dizzy and had to force myself to breathe. My hearing became muffled and I couldn&#39;t hear. I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

After about an hour and a half, tongue went numb and throat did not get better, and was still tight and closing. Gave me prednisone and Benadryl and took albuterol inhaler that opened throat and that helped open throat and Benadryl helped with the scratchiness.

                                                Full body aches starting the day after i received the vaccine. The next day the body soreness was severe enough to where it was painful to clench my fist or walk even a small distance. I also experienced nausea, loss of appetite, migraines and light sensitivity, and was unable to do normal tasks around the house for about 3-4 days. The full body soreness was the most debilitating symptom and certain aresa like elbows, knees, wrists and hips were painful to the touch. I think my joints were most affected. The soreness and pain can be compared to a flu but it was more intense than anything i have experienced before.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

                                                20 yr old Female patient received first dose Pfizer covid19 vaccine in left arm administered by pharmacy intern at 3:27pm .  supervising pharmacist was (Name) pharmD.   Prior to patient receiving the covid19 vaccine  pharmD reviewed and went over all the DUR and digital patient questionnaire questions.  Mother of patient was present and mentioned that in the patient&#39;s past , the patient had fainted after receiving a vaccine.  PharmD told patient that because this occurred in the past, the patient will have to wait 30 minutes after vaccine administration for observation.    Patient was sitting in post-vaccination area, and about 3 minutes later patient&#39;s father notified staff , that patient felt dizzy and  looked pale and had blurry vision and patient was sweating.  PharmD  asked the patient if she had any difficulty breathing and if she felt itchy or had any rash as a result of the vaccine reaction.    We immediately called the pharmacy and notified (Name) of the situation.  The patient refused us to contact 911 and refused 911 care.  The pharmacy manager immediately arrived to the Clinic fitting room area.  Upon arrival,  the pharmacy manager provided alcohol swabs to patient to inhale because at that moment we did not have ammonia inhalants. PharmD  quickly made his way to the pharmacy to obtain the ammonia inhalants , which is a respiratory stimulant.  The pharmD returned to the Covid19 clinic with ammonia inhalants, which were never used, because we did not see the need.  Patient remained conscious the entire incident.    We decided not to  use epinephrine.   The pharmD measured the patient&#39;s blood pressure at 3:38pm .  bp reading was 109/65.  Pharmacy manager took pt temperature at 3:45pm, reading was 97F.  Pharmacy manager retook blood pressure at 4pm.  bp reading was 93/63, pulse of  72.   The pharmacy manager advised the patient to seek medical attention if patient continues to get worse.  bp was lower the second reading.  The pharmacy manager asked  patient a second time at 4pm if patient wanted us to call 911 again, and again patient refused us to contact 911.

                                                syncopal episode; dry mouth; chills; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other health professional (patient). A 20-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose on 12Jan2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), second dose on 02Feb2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), both via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm, at 20-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not patient diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient experienced dry mouth, syncopal episode, chills, nausea on an unspecified date. The events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit. No treatment was received for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current limited available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be totally excluded/assessed.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

Soon I noticed it wasn?t just meat but chicken as well. What I was tasting was not metal but a real ugly taste that I would get mid chew that would make me spit it out. As the month went by I noticed it with random foods. Now I can sometimes just smell something and know it won?t taste good especially with foods that have a strong smell. Some foods are worse than others on how strong of an ugly taste the food has.

This led to 2 UrgentCare visits and a course of steroid pills (that helped for a few hours before the rash would start to reappear each day) After completing my second dose of the vaccine on April 25th (Lot# EW0169) around 7pm I woke up April 27th with the rash the completely covered my legs/groin/hip area and started spreading up my spinal and trunk as well as swelling fingers, face and lips, resulting in a hospital visit, more steroids and on the morning of April 28th a new rash began on my trunk, arm, neck and face in addition to the hive-like rash on my legs.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                Nerve pain throughout the entire body lasting approximately 18 hours. Felt like ants crawling through all my muscles. Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

After getting check out she left on her own accord. She stated while talking that when she gave blood in the past this has happened.

                                                Extreme blurred vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain the next day. Eye muscles were inflamed and pupils had delay in reaction to light. Have to wear sunglasses even inside due to light sensitivity, otherwise I get very nauseous. Has lasted over a week and have had to see ophthalmologist twice. Got steroid eye drops to take 4 times a day for 2 weeks.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

But after one week felt good again.

It felt like something was sitting on my chest. My lips and throat also got very itchy. I went over to a paramedic who gave me IV benadryl and something for nausea. My blood pressure and HR were initially high but lowered. My O2 was fine. Then I got really light headed and my tongue, throat, and whole face got more itchy. I then went to the ER and got epipen intramusclarly in the ambulance. At the hospital I got steroids and an IV bag. Around 3:30 I started to feel normal again. I stayed under observation for 4 hours. THen got discharged with a prescription of steroids.

I stayed next to her as a team member got a cold bottle of water and used as a compress on back of neck. She stated it was intensifying.  I had the store manager call 911 she appeared to pass out for a second as she came around she said her tongue was sore. but no problems breathing, itching , hives or swelling of tongue.  the other symptoms reduced .  the EMS arrived and she was feeling better.  EMS took Blood pressure and heart rate - both were normal.  She refused to be transported and EMS waited until she could stand.  I recommended to call the primary care physician to discuss seconf dose and posssilby have the second dose at a mass vaccination site where there is a physician because it took 15 miuntes for EMS to arrive.

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                Since the day of the vaccine, I have had a change in taste. Whenever I eat meat or anything savory, it tastes like gasoline. Some other things taste funny too. It began with my toothpaste, so I just thought it was a bad tube. After buying a new brand of toothpaste, I discovered that it was my tastebuds that were off. Toothpaste and anything minty or savory I once loved eating now tastes like gasoline smells. Once loved smells from cooking food are also unbearable now.  Most sweet foods still taste the same, though and are good.

I drink socially about 1x per month, sometimes consuming many more drinks than I consumed on this particular night. Never before did I encounter these effects from alcohol when consuming 1-1.5 drinks per hour.   The next day I felt very tired, sluggish, and run down all day long.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 17:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated her daughter received her first Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 5:30 pm. The patient&#39;s signs and symptoms began shortly after receiving the shot. That evening at 19:00, she had very itchy eyes, the next morning (07Jan2021) she woke up with swollen eyes, a rash on her forehead, around her eyes and both cheeks. She took benedryl and zyrtec on 07Jan2021. The symptoms clear up by 10Jan2021, following a visit to her HCP, on 08Jan2021. She received a steroid shot, a prednisone dose pack her HCP. Her HCP recommended she not take dose 2 and instructed her mother to call Pfizer for recommendations. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021.  The  reporting nurse considered the case as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events of swollen eyes, itching eyes and rash on face were likely related to first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), due to plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine around 12:30 pm. At around 4:00 pm, I noticed that my lips were slightly swollen. I went and bought liquid Benadryl. At around 5:45 pm, I took 20ml of the liquid Benadryl. I proceeded to sleep the rest of the night. I woke up around 8:20 am the next morning and noticed that my lips were significantly more swollen. I took 20ml more of the liquid Benadryl and noticed that my tongue was a little swollen as well. At around 9:40 am, I took 20ml more of liquid Benadryl.  I noticed no change in my swelling and my throat started to feel like there was a lump. At around 10:20 am,  I drove to the emergency room. The doctor noticed swelling in my lips and some in my tongue and throat. I was given cimetidine and methylprednisolone through an IV, which reduced the swelling. I was discharged 2 hours later after the swelling went down and was given 2 prescriptions to take the next 4 days, which were prednisone 20mg  (three tablets once a day) and famotidine 20mg (twice a day). There is some swelling in my lips in the morning (for the last two days) until I take the steroids, then it reduces the swelling. The overall cost of the emergency room visit was $1669.17.

Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

I felt faint and dizzy and couldn?t see my bed to lay down. After laying down, my head and body was tingling. I was sweating but felt cold.   I took 2 hydroxyzine and fell asleep. I woke up fine but with body aches. The body aches continued through the day but I took acetaminophen and the body aches went away.

                                                I had tested positive with covid in the ending of December after the holidays. With that I lost my sense of taste and smell. Fast foward, on Monday Feb. 22nd I received the second dose to the covid vaccine, on Friday I was eating tacos and I got this taste in my mouth and my stomach was bothering me I believe from the tacos beings bad (2 other people got sick too) but the taste lingers, The next morning I cook breakfast and lunch and I can smell this smell that I taste as well. It is not March 4th, 1 day shy of it being a week and I am still experiencing this. I can not taste any food flavor except this taste that I have, it has replaced all food flavors and smells. Whenever I cook something I can smell the scent I taste (only when Its food or Im cooking, I can smell my coconut lotion and body spray just fine). I do not know how to describe it I started describing it as it being an old grease taste but it could be a metallic taste I am not sure, all I know it is a very unpleasant taste. Whenever I brush my teeth, immediately when I put the toothpaste in my mouth i immediately taste the taste again its like it almost heightens it. The taste lingers in my mouth after that as well. I do have to say that I tried a chocolate covered pretzels and m&amp;m&#39;s and notices that I can taste sweet stuff but immediately get the taste when I eat regular foods thats are not sweet. I tried to eat waffles one time and the syrup taste was fine but I could not eat sausage because of the taste. This is very frustrating because its disgusting that I would rather not taste anything at all. I am unsure if my taste was ever fully back after having covid I was able to start tasting things but not sure if it was 100% as well as I could smell somethings but  not sure if that was 100%. I talked to some people who thought maybe it is my senses trying to fully come back because they heard about people experiencing weird smells when their senses were coming back but I am unsure I just want to not deal with this anymore. I think its weird it came 3 days after the vaccine and that I can not taste food other than this taste.

In the following 10 to 15 minutes my lips started tingling and my throat started to tighten up. The itching finally stopped after 10 minutes. The tingling in my lips and throat tightening occurred with both the first and second dose. The staff kept me for around 45-50 minutes for both doses of the vaccine.  When going home I took 2 Benadryl.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

                                                I lost my sense of smell and a little bit of sense of taste. I could have a whole cap of lemon juice and it tasted sweet. This lasted about 5 days and slowly got better. My taste would be ok in the morning then would go away again in the afternoon. I had two telehealth visit and they had me tested for COVID, I tested negative. I tested again a few days later and was negative again. My Doctor said it was most likely a viral infection.

Then in the evening, the feeling was more significant and I noticed red bumps on the back of my tongue and inflammation around that area. Woke up Thursday (today) morning with a sore/tender throat and the throat is red and imflamed.

                                                Patient received Covid-19 Vaccine today, 03/24/2021. During the 15 minute post-vaccine observation period, the patient began to feel faint.  Her condition worsened to feeling nauseous and blurred vision, so patient asked to lie down.  We found a quiet area in the employee break room for the patient to lay down.  and provided her a pillow, water, cool compress for her head, and later, orange juice for her comfort. We proceeded to call 911 for medical attention. EMS professionals evaluated patient&#39;s vital signs and patient signed waiver refusing to go to hospital, since she was feeling better. Patient left on her own accord with a friend driving her home.

So I was okay after the 30 minutes but when I started driving I felt like I was high on strong drugs. Like as if I?d taken an extremely strong marajuana edible and it just hit me. I had to pull over because my eyes wouldn?t stay open, my whole body was feeling very heavy and I was extremely tired and out of it. I didn?t have another way to get home (I had traveled about an hour) so I just kept driving and taking 15 min rests along the way. When I got home I fell asleep as soon as I sat down and slept for about four hours. I feel better now that I?m awake, still light headed but not near as bad.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 9:15 AM on March 9, 2021.  I then returned to work. At about 4:30 PM on that same day, I started feeling dizzy. I felt like I was going to faint at work. Every time I would stand up, I would feel like I was going to pass out.  I had someone drive me home because I felt that I was too dizzy to drive. I arrived home at 6:00 PM and began to vomit profusely. I threw up all night and had the chills.  In the morning, I felt better but still had a dizzy feeling. The dizziness and vomiting completely  subsided by March 11,  2021.    On March  12, 2021, I noticed that I had floating black spots in my left eye accompanied by a painful migraine. I have never had eye floaters or migraines previous to this vaccine. My migraine lasted for 5 days straight and I had to be off work to go to the emergency  room because I started to loose vision in my left eye. They were unsure of the cause because I did not have any pre-existing health conditions.  The migraine finally subsided after the 7th day. I have had eye floaters every since I got the vaccine. I?ve been to an eye doctor and my primary and they all have told me that it could be from this vaccine because I have never had the problem until I received it.

Throat started to close and feel tight like I could not breathe. Tongue swelled and could not feel tongue while biting down. Chest compression on center chest. Around 1:30 PM I told sister to get a nurse and the nurse said due to my allergic reaction I needed to do the EpiPen.  She administered properly in my thigh. About 1:35 PM, symptoms started to go away. Stayed until 1:45 PM and when I left I told the nurse I was leaving. Took 2 Benadryl pills in my car with water.

                                                Three days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, I woke up with a hives-like rash. This was specifically concentrated at both my elbows and both my knees. Here there were red, itchy, risen bumps about 1 cm in diameter. As you moved along the limb away from the concentrated regions, there were similar bumps smaller in size, about 1/4 cm in diameter. I also have a few bumps on my lips. The edges of my ears are also red and itchy. It has been one day since these appeared and I have taken one allergy pill, one Benadryl, and have applied hydrocortisone twice. The rash/hives have not improved or worsened as they appear visually.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old non pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, COVID 19, Formulation: solution for injection, Lot number: not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 18Jan2021 at 03:30 PM (at the age of 22-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included dysphagia. Concomitant medication included 40mg omeprazole. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had covid prior vaccination. There was no COVID tested post vaccination. On 19Jan2021, since receiving the vaccine the patient experienced anything minty or savory tastes like gasoline smells (Dysgeusia). it was reported that &#34;Anything sweet tastes fine still, but anything savory or minty that I once enjoyed now tastes and smells unbearable&#34;. No treatment was given for the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.

Over time, I noticed that I started tasting that same &#34;chemical-like&#34; smell in my food and it was become stronger. Certain foods such as meats, cucumbers and sodas, all have that same strong &#34;chemical-like&#34; taste/smell to me.  I had COVID19 in December of 2020 and lost my taste/smell for about 3 weeks.

                                                Started experiencing dizziness on the day of the second dose (4/30/21). Dizziness continued for 2 weeks and then stopped for a week and came back and have been experiencing it for almost 2 months now. Have gone to 7 doctor visits including an opthemologist, the emergency room twice and my primary care physician and a walk in clinic. I have been prescribed servers medications which do not alleviate the symptoms including meclazine, hydroxaline, scopolamine, amoxicillin, prednisone, Valium, and reglin (for headache). About 3 weeks after getting the second dose I began experiencing headaches so I went for a CT scan in the ER on 5/24 which came back normal. I returned to the ER on 2/27 with blurry vision and was sent for an MRI on my brain and neck which also came back normal. I have upcoming appointments with a neurologist and an ENT next month. I have also been experiencing muscle aches for the past 3 days specifically in my joints, my arms, and legs. I have also had headaches that feel like my head it being sliced or stabbed on the right side.

She also complained of chest tightness and difficulty swallowing. Patient also had vision changes. We gave the patient 1 tablet of Benadryl 25 mg and called EMS services. EMS checked her out and we advised the patient to go to the ER to be observed and given more Benadryl. Patient was able to walk out of facility herself.

                                                I woke up in the morning feeling some mild body aches. When I tried to stand up I became dizzy and immediately sat down. I started sweating, my vision started to turn black and I felt that like I was going to faint. I then became extremely nauseated and threw up. after about ten minutes the symptoms started mildly passing. I then began sweating again, feeling like I was going to faint, and I threw up a second time. These symptoms lasted for about an hour where I felt nauseous and faint. Then flowing these symptoms I felt dizzy for another 3 hours and continued having body aches for another 2 days.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

Slept another 2 hours, woke up extremely sweaty, fever had broken to 99.1, and headache was gone.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I felt extremely lightheaded, eyes were blurry for 5-10 minutes, and extreme sweating all over my body. These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

Patient felt fine when she left the pharmacy and headed home. 20-30 minutes after she left the pharmacy she began to feel that she was having trouble swallowing and eventually noticed that she was having trouble breathing and had bumps on her tongue as well as swollen lips. She drove to the ER and arrived at 3:50 PM where they administered her EpiPen along with benadryl and prednisone. She felt better within 15-20 minutes of EpiPen administration and remained in the hospital for 4 hours until her blood pressure was stable. She is still taking prednisone and has not had any other issues since ER discharge.

                                                While waiting in after the vaccination I experience the slightest discomfort with my breathing but thought it might be related to double masking. Upon driving home, I realized I had non-itchy and non-painful hives on the upper portion of my right cheek and the lower jaw on the left side. As time progressed, the hives disappeared from left side and moved down the right side of my face. After it passed on the right side it reappeared on the left side and followed the same pattern. My dermatographia also returned on my chest and I haven&#39;t had an episode of it for over year. The roof of my mouth was also itchy. All hives, itchy mouth, and slight breathing discomfort passed by 7 pm without the use of an antihistamine. No other signs of allergic reaction has been noted since. Breathing concerns passed the quickest (after 2 or so hours), then itchy mouth, and last the non-itchy hives. Other than that, I experienced the common side effect of body aches during the night and pain in vaccinated arm.

Then throughout the day the swelling started to go down but then my neck began getting red. I then developed a light rash on my neck, chest, and arms. The only part that was slightly itching was my neck. I continued to take Benadryl and used cortisone cream on my neck. I woke up the next day with my eyelids being swollen again. Benadryl helped. The rash is going down and all I have left is a rash on my left wrist which developed on the 4th day after my vaccine.

Nausea, dizziness, haziness, and headache were on and off the rest of the day, subsiding around 6 PM.

She noted that she had not eaten for several hours prior to vaccine administration.  Patient was given water to drink and a bottle of fruit flavored tea.  After consuming fluids, she began to regain her usual skin tone and reported &#34;feeling better, but not quite right&#34;.  She was observed for an additional 20 minutes and offered crackers to eat.  She called a friend to come pick her up and drive her home.  She left the clinic ambulatory accompanied by friend.

I administed the vaccine in the counseling room and requested she remain in the room until she felt ok. Patient said she felt fine after about a minute, and she moved to the pharmacy waiting area. The patient called out that something was wrong from the waiting area after about 5 minutes. Pharmacist and technicians went over and patient reported loss of vision and hearing. She said she could not see anything and that her hearing wasn&#39;t right. The nurse practitioner on duty provided a cool compress for the head and neck, as well as juice. Patient remained in the waiting area for about 10 minutes and then was moved to the little clinic room to lay down. She remained in the clinic room for another 10 minutes until she felt better. Patient did not lose consciousness, was able to walk out of clinic to her car.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

                                                Immediately after injection, started getting black spots in vision. I was able to drive through the cones to the waiting area but the black spots were getting worse to the point where I could barely see. My ears also felt numb and I could barely hear anything. I got to the waiting area (drive-thru clinic) and they weren&#39;t making people wait the 15 min so I told them I could barely see and couldn&#39;t drive. I was attended to by medical personnel. My vision was almost completely full of black spots, slurry speech, I felt very sweaty and very weak. As I was being attended to, the only thing that helped was reclining my seat and closing my eyes with the A/C on. After about 20 min my vision was improving and my friend picked me up from the site. I proceeded to lay down and drink lots of gatorade and felt more normal in a few hours to the point of being able to drive home. I continued to feel weak and fatigued for the rest of the day. The next day I had very bad arm pain, but it seemed normal compared to other vaccines I&#39;ve received. The third day (today) I have a massive headache all day that is not improving from tylenol and seems very different than the average dehydration headache. Not sure if that&#39;s related to the vaccine but seems possible.

                                                Woke up exactly 12 hours after my second dose at 3am with a high fever, vomiting, and visual hallucinations probably due to the fever. It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

I experienced heavy allergy symptoms including redness and swelling in left eye, watery eyes particularly in left eye, runny nose and pain particularly in left nostril, heaviness of breath, tiredness.  I think it is of note that as of writing this, I have not received commonly reported symptoms of fever, chills and nausea in conjunction with the reported adverse symptoms.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0162) (at the age of 23-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and diagnosed at age 2, allergy and allergy to bull dogs. Concomitant medications included budesonid taken for allergy, start and stop date were not reported; formoterol fumarate dihydrate taken for allergy, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her lungs felt swollen in Apr2021, the back of her tongue felt numb/developed a numb tongue on 17Apr2021, throat was itchy then sore/her throat was sore and itchy on 17Apr2021, chest pain on 17Apr2021, not quite normal breathing/uncomfortable breathing/heavy breathing that was more of an irregular breathing/out of breath walking up the steps on 17Apr2021 and fatigue on 17Apr2021. A family member had some reaction to the first pfizer covid-19 vaccine. Wanted to know where can she find information to determine if the second vaccine shot is safe. 40 minutes from the time of the injection the back of her tongue felt numb and her throat was itchy then sore. About 40 minutes after that those symptoms went away. Later in the day she had chest pain and not quite normal breathing. After using her asthma inhaler twice in a short time this dissapated. Fatigue remained for about a week. Her daughter was prescribed Metronidazole 500mg (she initially thought it was penicillin) and the packaging information of the antibiotic says not to receive any vaccines. She was scheduled for her second dose next Tuesday (18May2021) and wanted to know if it would this be applicable to the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. Mother calling on behalf of daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine on 17Apr2021. She was told to wait 30 minutes after the vaccine and was okay, however after 40 minutes after the vaccine she developed a numb tongue, her throat was sore and itchy. This subsided within about 30 minutes (also reported as 40 minutes). About 4 hours after the vaccine she developed chest pain and uncomfortable breathing. Her daughter states her lungs felt swollen, and was out of breath walking up the steps. She did use her AuviQ and albuterol inhaler and the first dose of AuviQ didn&#39;t work so she repeated it and it helped. She called the doctor and used her peak flow meter and the doctor on call stated that her reading was okay and did not need further medical attention. After that evening those side effects went away. Caller has a past medical history of asthma and allergies to bulldogs. If she was even around someone who has been near a bull dog she will develop chest symptoms. Mother spoke with CDC and they told her as long as her daughter didn&#39;t go to the ER it was okay for her to receive the vaccine and wanted to know if she get her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled to receive it next Tuesday (18May2021). Her doctor said that some people react to the polyethylene glycol and want to know if she could get tested for that. After the patient received the vaccine, her tongue was numb and her throat was sore and itchy but it went away. This started 40 minutes after the patient received the vaccine. 4 hours after the patient received the vaccine, she had chest pain and heavy breathing. The caller is nervous because the patient has only had this chest pain during a severe allergic reaction in the past. The patient do about the second dose. The patient was also prescribed an antibiotic this week and the antibiotic paperwork said not to have any vaccines while taking that product. The patient is due for the second dose of the vaccine this week, is it okay to get because she will still be on the penicillin. This event happened after receiving the first dose of the vaccine on 17Apr2021. The patient also had fatigue for a week. The patient had the heavy breathing that was more of an irregular breathing. The patient&#39;s lungs felt swollen, it felt like there was weight on her chest, it was uncomfortable breathing. The caller felt out of breath walking up the steps. The caller used her inhaler twice. The patient underwent lab test included investigations: the on call doctor had the patient do the peak flow meter and it was fine, over 550 on 17Apr2021. No more information was available. The doctor also had the patient press her chest to see if there was pain when she touched it and there was not so the on call doctor felt comfortable not making the patient go to the emergency room. Caller reports that her daughter received her first vaccine dose on 17Apr2021 and afterwards experienced a severe reaction with symptoms including, tongue swelling, sore throat, and Chest pain. Caller reported that it didn&#39;t getm severe enough for her to need an Epi pen. Caller reports that they have an appointment to see her doctor as well, for further discussion. She calls today to ask if symptoms with the second dose are expected to be worse than they were with the first shot and timing of the second dose.

Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of the event her lungs felt swollen was unknown, the event fatigue was recovered in Apr2021, the other events was recovered on 17Apr2021.

                                                ?Pfizer-BioNTech Covid 19 Vaccine EUA? The night of getting the first shot I barely slept because I had chills all night long &amp; my entire body was so sore it hurt to lay in any position. In the morning, I still had extreme muscle pain all over. I was extremely light headed &amp; dizzy, I had a throbbing headache so I  took 2 aleve pills. I was getting super nauseous and almost passed out while trying to get to my bathroom just in time to throw up only water. Just before throwing up my vision went fuzzy,  my ears were ringing, I was dripping sweat, it was getting hard to breathe, &amp; my hands were shaking.  After taking a cold shower, laying down, &amp; drinking some water I feel a bit better but not 100% normal.

                                                4/30 - Five minutes after the vaccine, I passed out. I felt uncontrollably shaky and my vision went white. I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

                                                headache - not bad enough to need pain medication with my activity set for that day, but with a different activity set I would have taken an OTC pain reliever - headache lasted throughout the first evening and got worse the next day.  After about 36 hours it had resolved itself. strange feeling that I can best describe as &#34;trippy&#34; - lasted from about two hours after the vaccine until I went to bed that night - The cheese I ate with dinner tasted abnormally strong, I kept feeling like everything around me was moving even though it wasn&#39;t (felt like the floor / walls were moving - similar to when I&#39;m super tired and / or severely jet lagged), and somehow colors seemed a little off.  When I woke up the next morning this &#34;trippy&#34; feeling was gone.

                                                About 20 hours after the injection, my right eye started twitching, and within 5 seconds, the bottom half of my face (from my cheekbones down) went numb, and my mouth drooped open on both sides. The muscles in my lips were not working, and I had a hard time speaking. I could force a smile if I tried really hard, but if I was relaxed, the corners of my mouth were low on my face, and my mouth hung open.  It lasted about 5 minutes and over a minute faded back to normal. I went to urgent care after speaking with a triage nurse.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

I alerted a nurse, who took held my head and helped me regulate breathing as I started to pass out. She held an ice pack to my neck and got me water.  She and another nurse tried to move towards an open door for fresh air and wanted to lay me down on a gurney, but I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me to a wheelchair, where I stayed for about 35 minutes more until I had recovered. I don&#39;t think I fully lost consciousness, but almost completely lost sight and hearing. I was not consciously anxious about getting the vaccine or needles.

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

                                                The day following the immunization patient experienced swollen eye lids and the surrounding areas. She was treating pink eye at the time so she did not attribute the swelling to the vaccine. However, later that day she developed rashes and hives on her torso. She began a regimen of OTC benadryl and self treated at home. She called the pharmacy on Thursday, 4 days post vaccination asking if she needed to do more. The Benadryl was helping but the reaction was ongoing. It was recommended she visit the urgent care to be evaluated and treated appropriately. Her second dose appointment was cancelled.

I went to the Med Center and the doctor said my inner ear is very swollen but definitely not infected. My ear is still popping but not feeling less blocked. So far I have been using Sudafed, Allegra, Flonaze to help try and bring my hearing completely back and the swelling down.

A week later, I began to experience breast soreness, lasting up through the next withdrawal bleeding cycle; I took a second pregnancy test just before the second placebo week. In the next placebo pill week, I experienced 5 days of heavy bleeding, the first two of which presented with severe cramping, which has not happened in many years.

It spread over the course of the next day to the entire body and included both ears turning red and swelling up. Skin hot to the touch and slightly numb. Documented progression of redness and rash on face. Went to see doctor approximately 48 hours after initial shot, advised to take Benadryl and if that does not work or if it gets worse to call back. Advised not to take second dose of vaccine as it is likely an allergic reaction.

Blacked out for about a minute and lost consciousness but was able to still stand either because I was holding onto something or someone was helping me (not sure).  Came to and was drenched in sweat and stomach was churning. Hearing and vision came back after a few minutes. About an hour later, full body chills and body aches.

I frequently donate plasma. I had no side effects from the shot up until that point. Immediately after donating, I got in my car and looked down to see that my needle injection site from donating was pouring out an excessive amount of blood. I lost all vision and the employees helped to rebandage the site and put pressure. That had never happened before after donating. It seemed that my blood failed to clot.

Shampoo smells different than usual.

Also, certain cleaning products and soaps have a different strange smell, that is different from the other smell. The smells don&#39;t seem to affect taste though, and although unpleasant I can still eat/use the things with these strange smells.

                                                I got the vaccine some time in the night when i was taking a shower i noticed arm soreness. when i went to bed around 11pm from the top of my shoulder down to my finger tips it was swollen and had arm pain. I tried to go to bed and about 30 minutes later i went to get up to grab some advil. I checked in the mirror to see if there was redness and got light headed. Next thing i know i passed out. I woke up on the floor and a big pool of blood i dont know how long i was out for. I had a nose bleed and had a bruise on my head, I could leave the bath room because i was shaking so bad and couldnt use any force to get up. After 45 mins that i went to my room and called my mom who is a physican i sat on the floor for 3 or 4 hours until i could get the nose bleed to stop. I ended up then getting into bed and the shacking had stopped after 800 mg of advil. I checked my pupils for signs of cuncussion. the 1/25 i had my first appointment and we checked to see if i broke my nose. after that the next days they did see signs of concussion with sleeping 20 hours a day and blurry vision. I went back to  med center to get an mri and eeg to see about the concussion because they were worried since i didnt know how long i was out for. They also sent me to a concussion specialist. I had follow up care about the concussion for a month or so.  For about a week floowing the vaccine i was taking 800mg 3times a day for the tremor&#39;s and fever

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Got vaccination at 11am. At 7pm felt general feeling of malaise. Went to bed at 9:30 but had trouble getting to sleep. Woke up at 5am with body aches and headache. Sat on the toilet but felt dizzy, had ringing in my ears, and felt woosy. Laid  back on bed and raised feet above my head. Took my temperature, it was 99.3F, which is a little high for me.  Ringing stopped after I laid down.

                                                Immediately got redness of injection site feeling of nausea. Needed to take my mask off to get fresh air.  Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

The ambulance team arrived 10 minutes later and determined that patient was not severely reacted.   Patient decided not to go to the ER and recovered after that.

Concomitant medications included vitamin B complex (VITAMIN B), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), and loratadine (CLARITIN) and unspecified birth control (BC) pills. The patient previously received codeine and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in the hospital.

It went down upon icing and taking two over the counter Benadryl. However, the next morning, the eye was still a bit puffy and swollen. The events were considered non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovering. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.

The day prior to testing positive I had been notified that I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. I did not have any symptoms when I tested positive on 12/28/20 except for a headache later that night. The next day I felt fatigued and had nasal congestion. On 12/30/20, i noticed that I had lost my sense of smell and my sense of taste was altered. I also felt mild chest tightness however my o2 sats remained above 95%. The congestion and fatigue only lasted for two days and my sense of smell and taste had come back by 1/1/21. The chest tightness has persisted even now after testing negative but has diminished over time and occurs less frequently.

My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

My first dose of covid vaccine I had a tingling tongue and face and just took some Claritin and Pepcid. The second time around my entire mouth went numb and it felt like there was something in my throat. My airway was not impacted but it felt off. I was given 25mg of Benadryl and monitored for half an hour with vitals every 5 minutes. I?m 14 hours out from the reaction and I feel fine now.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                I began having hives on my chest late Thursday night on the 18th, I took Benadryl to try and ease the hives. I continued to have hives spread across my chest, both arms, stomach, and the back of my knees from the 18-22, I suddenly lost my voice on the 21st when I woke up in the morning. I went to a park view clinic in my town on the 22nd and received treatment for my hives. As of the 24th I am taking medications prescribed to me and my hives are slowly going away and my voice is coming back. I have also experienced nasal drainage and a cough from the 19 and onward.

                                                I have been experiencing high blood pressure between about 140/90 and 130/85 with headaches and tinnitus. Blood pressure remains high throughout the day and was first noticed on 03/20/2021. I first took my blood pressure after noticing a mild headache that was not alleviated with hydration or OTC pain medication. Headaches have returned intermittently since 03/20/2021 but now only lasts 1-2 hours. Tinnitus was noticed several weeks ago (specific date is unknown) and is a mild and quiet but constant high frequency ringing. Unsure if any of these are related but I have never had tinnitus and my blood pressure is not this high nor do I have headaches often or back-to-back.

After my second dose my arm initially didn?t hurt but started to hurt hours later. I had cough and sore throat but the worse thing was I woke up with super puffy red eyes with green discharge coming out. I was fine until I got the Pfizer vaccine. The morning after I felt terrible. I called my doctor to see what he can do or prescribe for my eyes.

She did vomit and complained that she was lightheaded and her vision was blurry/it was difficult to see. We sat her down in a chair, gave her water, and had her rest. After checking on her multiple times over the course of 30 minutes, she stated she was starting to feel better. After the waiting period was over, she left with her husband.

                                                I&#39;d had Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) twice in my life (once in 2013 and once in 2015). I have not had it since 2015 until I got vaccinated on 3/29/21 and began to develop BP symptoms on the evening of 4/6/21 (headache on right side of my head/temple, odd sensation on right side of my tongue, almost like I burned it on a hot beverage) but I didn&#39;t think anything of it. I went to sleep and then, on the morning of 4/7/21, I woke up feeling extremely fatigued, brain fogged, and weak. I didn&#39;t notice any of the BP symptoms until I went to brush my teeth and realized I had lost motor function in the right side of my mouth. I immediately made a telehealth appointment with an Urgent Care doctor in order to get an Rx of Prednisone. I began taking the Prednisone around 3pm on Wednesday, 4/7/21. I also have been taking vitamin B-12 and a Women&#39;s Multivitamin to help regenerate nerve function.  However, since starting the prednisone, my symptoms have continued to develop. Symptoms currently include: right side of my face is extremely swollen; I have lost mobility on the right side of my face, the right side of my tongue still feels numb; right eye tearing non-stop; some mild ear pain in right inner ear; slight pins-and-needles sensation in my fingers on my right hand; difficulty eating and drinking; still feeling fatigued.  I have recovered from BP twice before so I am not too worried about having it again. I just think the FDA needs to put out a warning to the public that there may be a correlation between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and Bell&#39;s Palsy recurrences. I know this is not a coincidence, and my BP relapse was a result of my body experiencing an immune reaction from the vaccine.

                                                After almost two weeks I started feeling feverish and achy all over my body. I had head pain almost to the point of migraine, felt weak and lost my appetite. Every time I stood up I felt sharp pain on the top of my head and got lightheaded. These symptoms responded a little to medication such as Tylenol and DayQuil but steadily worsened over the course of a few days then suddenly worsened. I woke up yesterday feeling more feverish and weak to the point where my mobility was compromised. My head felt like a balloon and hurt around the base of my skull and the top of my head. I had even more severe light sensitivity and could not tolerate sound. I also couldn?t bend down to pick something up or tie my shoes because of the lightheadedness and pain. The headache and migraine symptoms responded well to Toradol and Excedrin but returned full force after any medicine wore off. I am not getting any better despite rest and treatment.

                                                At 2:43pm patient received the vaccine in her arm. At 2:50pm my pharmacy technician witnessed the patient standing up from her chair and walk up to the pharmacy counter then faint into the pharmacy immunization booth. My technician states the patient did not hit her head on a wall. At 2:51pm my pharmacy technician brought the incident to my attention and we both ran to the patient to address the situation.  The patient was unresponsive, so I ran and dial 911 then instructed my tech to take the phone. I then ran back to the patient and patted her back, said her name and asked her if she could hear me.  It was at that moment the patient&#39;s eyes flickered and the patient had what looked to me like a 10 second seizure in the chair inside the pharmacy booth.  Once the patient was done what I could only identify as seizing, she came to and I asked her if she new her name and where she was. The patient answered correctly and then asked me &#34;Have you had anyone with a reaction like this before?&#34;. I answered that I have not personally witnessed a reaction like this before. My technician had 911 still on the phone and they instructed her to stand out front of the store to await the ambulance. A first responding officer came in and asked about the witnesses to the incident then took over for caring for the patient.

                                                The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was taken on March 15th at 8:30. Within a week I started feeling weak joints, headaches followed by a sharp pain on the occipital lobe. I started my period for the second time that month, which was odd because it never happened to me before. I went to work that week, but by Friday (March 30th) I was not able to handle the pain so after work I went to the doctor and they took blood to see if there was anything going on. The result came back the following day and everything was normal. I was given medicine (muscle relaxers) for the occipital pain, but it was not enough. At that time I was not sure what was the cause of it, I thought it was a bad flu, but I didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that it was because of the vaccine, because a week had passed by, so I thought it was impossible. The doctor asked for me to take an X-Ray for the occipital pain, so I did (March 30th) and it resulted in everything being fine. She also recommended for me to get an abdominal ultrasound to see if my uterus was fine due to the second period. I currently took the second Pfizer dose in the same location, but this time around I felt all of these symptoms within 3 hours of the vaccination. I started feeling lightheaded and dazed, my joints started feeling weak, my mouth and tongue started feeling sensitive (fever blisters and sensitive to anything that is acidic, spicy, etc).  I have not visited the doctor this time around because the pain is tolerable. I have noticed in increase of joint pain as the days go by.

Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, hives developed on my left thigh. The tongue swelling, shortness of breath and faintness happened on and off for the first day. It resolved on its own by the next day. The hives got progressively worse and peaked roughly 48 hours after getting the vaccine. They slowly faded, but are still faintly noticeable. I had general malaise  for the rest of the week. I have photos showing the progression of the hives.

                                                I received my first shot on April 6th, 2021, and on April 18th, 2021 I experienced extreme numbness with slight pain in the fold and shoulder of my arm. I went to the ER and they took a cat scan of my neck and reported back that everything looked normal - the nurse said it was most likely Cervical Radiculopathy. Then the following morning around 11 AM, I experienced very intense burning in my chest starting on the right side, eventually moving to the left encompassing my entire upper chest. I also experienced a very bad migraine, which I am typically used to but this one was more of a pressure headache between my temples that I felt in my ears and jaw. I made the decision to go back to the ER and to a different one this time. The ER failed to administer a Covid-19 test and to take bloodwork - both faults that family and friends in the medical field have pointed out to me. The doctor there had me receive an IV, a chest X-Ray, and an EKG. The X-Ray and EKG were both normal. The doctor had ordered a Covid-19 test but the nurse forgot to administer it before my discharge. In my IV I received Benadryl and Reglan along with typical IV fluids. I was also given Pepcid and Mylanta. At the end of my visit, the doctor concluded that he thought it was my acid reflux acting up - gastroenteritis. I went home and continued to experience chest burning, tightness, occasional numbness/pains in my body, and very, very bad headaches. On top of that, I could barely swallow - it felt as if my throat was closing. I took Pepcid and Tums and neither really did anything. After seeing a Cardiologist this same week, they ordered an Echocardiogram and routine bloodwork (metabolic panel). I will also be following up with a GI, and I received a Covid-19 test today and am awaiting the results. It is possible I contracted Covid before my shot, but it is also possible that I am having a delayed reaction to my first vaccination as well. Who knows.

                                                High fever (101°F), chills, fatigue, and burning eyes 12h post-injection. 1000mg acetaminophen would reduce fever to ~99°F within 1.5h of dosing, only to return to the high 100/low 101°F range once it starts to wear off. Fever broke in the early am hours of 4/22/21, with the chills going away as fever was gone. The burning eye sensation and tiredness were no longer present upon waking am of 4/23/21.  Itchy skin and hives on feet around noon on 4/21/21. Hives on feet disappeared on their own by early pm of 4/22/21. Itchy and sensitive skin persists as of time of this report in early pm 4/23/21. Shallow breathing (normal and deep breaths were painful), wheezing, and feeling like I&#39;m breathing through a sponge and that there is concrete (serving as weight) in my chest every time I inhaled began early am 4/21/20. I began producing mucus from deep coughs as of late pm 4/22/21 and that also continues to the time of this report, accompanied by wheezing and slightly deeper (but still shallower than normal) breathing.

The patient shortly after expressing this concern slumped over in the chair, shaking and twitching, for a few moments (likely 60 seconds or less) before regaining normal stature and attention. The patient expressed some changes in her field of vision, a continuation of feeling light-headed, and a ringing in her ears.  EMS was called to evaluate the patient, concerned that the patient had experienced seizure activity. EMS arrived shortly after, evaluating the patient&#39;s current state and vitals. After assessment, EMS determined this was a syncopal episode related to the patient&#39;s anxiety around the vaccination and cleared the patient to drive themselves home after resting on-site. Patient rested and recovered in pharmacy vaccination room for an additional 20 minutes before leaving.

                                                I have a sharp pain in my left ear. I can still hear noises like usual, such as background fridge noise. But this pain is an incident condition that I did not ever experience before. It?s not a constant pain and comes in waves. My right ear feels normal. I have not sought a medical appointment yet, and am waiting to see if the pain goes away.

No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

                                                I developed a &#34;blurry spot&#34; (later noted to be a scrotoma) in my vision of my right eye a few days after my vaccine. No pain was associated, just a small spot of blurred/rainbow vision. I did not initially connect it to the vaccine, and do not know for sure if it is connected, but it seems pertinent. I was first seen by my optometrist who did a retina scan and found a retinal hemorrhage. I subsequently saw my PCP, a neurologist and a retina specialist. After more scans, I was diagnosed with Acute nueromacular retinopathy. My doctor, who is a specialist in this specific disorder, noted there had been some connections to this very rare disorder and Covid-19, as well as vaccines. Not a lot is known about this disease, but I did have other potential risk factors, such as being on birth control. Hard to say what actually caused it. But the close connection to the vaccine in timing is suspicious. I am personally curious if there are other documented cases.

                                                Had a mild allergic reaction: itching throat and mouth, hot mouth, frontal headache, and almost immediate itching at injection site (I did not mention this to the healthcare professional, as I did not want to scare or alarm those waiting to get their vaccination). Took two Benadryl, and the symptoms subsided within thirty minutes. The itching throat and mouth, frontal headache, and hot mouth reaction happened within 20-30 minutes of receiving the shot. Told a pharmacy technician/pharmacist at the counter about the incident.

                                                Shortly after the second vaccination shot, I was feeling unwell and had major body aches and headaches for approx 4 days afterwards. I also had the feeling of a sinus infection that would not stop. About 11 days later I woke up with double vision and could not see properly. My left eye was fully dilated and visibly tilted to a different direction than my right. I went to the hospital and they did several tests and are unsure about what exactly is wrong and caused this and say that it is very rare. They shows in the MRI that there is a cavernous angioma in my brain and they think it is causing the eye issues. My other eye also has unusual blurry distance vision. While in the hospital they tried using 2 different steroids that did not seem to work. They discharged me from the hospital and basically just said to wait and they think it might possibly start to get better in a month. I am not sure what to do at this point and I&#39;m worried it may be a result of the vaccine.

                                                All of the below occurred after Pfizer shot #2 administered on 4/1/2021. Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.
