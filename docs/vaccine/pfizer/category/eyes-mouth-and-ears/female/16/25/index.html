                                                Patient was administered the vaccine around 6:15 pm on 2/23/21 and she waited in the pharmacy recovery area for the full 15 minute time.  Patient called the pharmacy after she had just returned home (around 7 pm) and said her throat felt funny and she had a metallic taste in her mouth.  Confirmed no difficulty breathing at that point, but that her throat felt a &#34;little thick&#34;.    As patient was already at home and not near the pharmacy area, recommended that she immediately go to ER to be seen as felt the delay of driving back to potentially get epi injection and then be sent to ER could be detrimental to the patient.  She confirmed that she would head to the nearest ER.

Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

The day after this subsided I started to get extremely itchy rashes on my neck that would come and go.  This has continued to occur. Exactly one week after the vaccine was given my lips began to swell up and become numb, again this went away with time.

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

                                                Since the day of the vaccine, I have had a change in taste. Whenever I eat meat or anything savory, it tastes like gasoline. Some other things taste funny too. It began with my toothpaste, so I just thought it was a bad tube. After buying a new brand of toothpaste, I discovered that it was my tastebuds that were off. Toothpaste and anything minty or savory I once loved eating now tastes like gasoline smells. Once loved smells from cooking food are also unbearable now.  Most sweet foods still taste the same, though and are good.

                                                swollen eyes; a rash on her forehead , around her eyes and both cheeks; very itchy eyes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient&#39;s mother).  A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 17:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated her daughter received her first Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 5:30 pm. The patient&#39;s signs and symptoms began shortly after receiving the shot. That evening at 19:00, she had very itchy eyes, the next morning (07Jan2021) she woke up with swollen eyes, a rash on her forehead, around her eyes and both cheeks. She took benedryl and zyrtec on 07Jan2021. The symptoms clear up by 10Jan2021, following a visit to her HCP, on 08Jan2021. She received a steroid shot, a prednisone dose pack her HCP. Her HCP recommended she not take dose 2 and instructed her mother to call Pfizer for recommendations. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021.  The  reporting nurse considered the case as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events of swollen eyes, itching eyes and rash on face were likely related to first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), due to plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had tested positive with covid in the ending of December after the holidays. With that I lost my sense of taste and smell. Fast foward, on Monday Feb. 22nd I received the second dose to the covid vaccine, on Friday I was eating tacos and I got this taste in my mouth and my stomach was bothering me I believe from the tacos beings bad (2 other people got sick too) but the taste lingers, The next morning I cook breakfast and lunch and I can smell this smell that I taste as well. It is not March 4th, 1 day shy of it being a week and I am still experiencing this. I can not taste any food flavor except this taste that I have, it has replaced all food flavors and smells. Whenever I cook something I can smell the scent I taste (only when Its food or Im cooking, I can smell my coconut lotion and body spray just fine). I do not know how to describe it I started describing it as it being an old grease taste but it could be a metallic taste I am not sure, all I know it is a very unpleasant taste. Whenever I brush my teeth, immediately when I put the toothpaste in my mouth i immediately taste the taste again its like it almost heightens it. The taste lingers in my mouth after that as well. I do have to say that I tried a chocolate covered pretzels and m&amp;m&#39;s and notices that I can taste sweet stuff but immediately get the taste when I eat regular foods thats are not sweet. I tried to eat waffles one time and the syrup taste was fine but I could not eat sausage because of the taste. This is very frustrating because its disgusting that I would rather not taste anything at all. I am unsure if my taste was ever fully back after having covid I was able to start tasting things but not sure if it was 100% as well as I could smell somethings but  not sure if that was 100%. I talked to some people who thought maybe it is my senses trying to fully come back because they heard about people experiencing weird smells when their senses were coming back but I am unsure I just want to not deal with this anymore. I think its weird it came 3 days after the vaccine and that I can not taste food other than this taste.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

I started sweating, my vision started to turn black and I felt that like I was going to faint. I then became extremely nauseated and threw up. after about ten minutes the symptoms started mildly passing. I then began sweating again, feeling like I was going to faint, and I threw up a second time. These symptoms lasted for about an hour where I felt nauseous and faint. Then flowing these symptoms I felt dizzy for another 3 hours and continued having body aches for another 2 days.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

I also began to feel a soreness in the back of my throat and my ears. Mild fatigue was also observed.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

Could not complete anything that required any type of focus such as watch TV/go on phone, the light increased headache. Slept on and off all day. Evening (1/26; 4:30pm): Took Excedrin for headache, was told by other coworkers not to medicate until 24 hours after at least, so did not take anything up to this point just in case. Slept another 2 hours, woke up extremely sweaty, fever had broken to 99.1, and headache was gone.

I also have noticed that I am not able to taste some feeds as strongly as before. I haven?t lost those senses but they have changed slightly. Nothing too impactful or serious though. My second dose is coming up on 2/8.

During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

The day prior to testing positive I had been notified that I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. I did not have any symptoms when I tested positive on 12/28/20 except for a headache later that night. The next day I felt fatigued and had nasal congestion. On 12/30/20, i noticed that I had lost my sense of smell and my sense of taste was altered. I also felt mild chest tightness however my o2 sats remained above 95%. The congestion and fatigue only lasted for two days and my sense of smell and taste had come back by 1/1/21. The chest tightness has persisted even now after testing negative but has diminished over time and occurs less frequently.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.
