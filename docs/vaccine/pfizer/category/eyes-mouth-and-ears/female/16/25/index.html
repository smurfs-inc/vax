As patient was already at home and not near the pharmacy area, recommended that she immediately go to ER to be seen as felt the delay of driving back to potentially get epi injection and then be sent to ER could be detrimental to the patient.  She confirmed that she would head to the nearest ER.

                                                Awoke the next morning with severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain (?felt Like being hit by a truck?). Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                Around 7-7:30 PM, I started to feel weird tingly feelings run up and down all of my limbs at the same time but it was over in about 2 minutes. Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head. That happened for about 4 minutes or so sometimes it would happen like 3 or 4 times in a row and sometimes it would be every 20 seconds or so. I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021.

Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

Withing one hour throat tightness resolved, respiratory rate reamined normal, left eye swelling was improving and nodule to forehead was decreasing in size. Floaters were persistent. 24 hours later pt reports no recurrence of throat tightness, normal respiratory rate, resolution of left eye swelling, some decrease in size of forehead nodule. Floaters have been persistent and unchanged.   *24 hours after second vaccine pt has onset of palpable lymph nodes to anterior cervical chain, single node to left supraclavicular chain and left axillary swelling. This was not considered an allergic reaction and attributed to immune response to vaccine.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                Nerve pain throughout the entire body lasting approximately 18 hours. Felt like ants crawling through all my muscles. Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                Since the day of the vaccine, I have had a change in taste. Whenever I eat meat or anything savory, it tastes like gasoline. Some other things taste funny too. It began with my toothpaste, so I just thought it was a bad tube. After buying a new brand of toothpaste, I discovered that it was my tastebuds that were off. Toothpaste and anything minty or savory I once loved eating now tastes like gasoline smells. Once loved smells from cooking food are also unbearable now.  Most sweet foods still taste the same, though and are good.

Her HCP recommended she not take dose 2 and instructed her mother to call Pfizer for recommendations. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021.  The  reporting nurse considered the case as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events of swollen eyes, itching eyes and rash on face were likely related to first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), due to plausible temporal relationship.

                                                I had tested positive with covid in the ending of December after the holidays. With that I lost my sense of taste and smell. Fast foward, on Monday Feb. 22nd I received the second dose to the covid vaccine, on Friday I was eating tacos and I got this taste in my mouth and my stomach was bothering me I believe from the tacos beings bad (2 other people got sick too) but the taste lingers, The next morning I cook breakfast and lunch and I can smell this smell that I taste as well. It is not March 4th, 1 day shy of it being a week and I am still experiencing this. I can not taste any food flavor except this taste that I have, it has replaced all food flavors and smells. Whenever I cook something I can smell the scent I taste (only when Its food or Im cooking, I can smell my coconut lotion and body spray just fine). I do not know how to describe it I started describing it as it being an old grease taste but it could be a metallic taste I am not sure, all I know it is a very unpleasant taste. Whenever I brush my teeth, immediately when I put the toothpaste in my mouth i immediately taste the taste again its like it almost heightens it. The taste lingers in my mouth after that as well. I do have to say that I tried a chocolate covered pretzels and m&amp;m&#39;s and notices that I can taste sweet stuff but immediately get the taste when I eat regular foods thats are not sweet. I tried to eat waffles one time and the syrup taste was fine but I could not eat sausage because of the taste. This is very frustrating because its disgusting that I would rather not taste anything at all. I am unsure if my taste was ever fully back after having covid I was able to start tasting things but not sure if it was 100% as well as I could smell somethings but  not sure if that was 100%. I talked to some people who thought maybe it is my senses trying to fully come back because they heard about people experiencing weird smells when their senses were coming back but I am unsure I just want to not deal with this anymore. I think its weird it came 3 days after the vaccine and that I can not taste food other than this taste.

In the following 10 to 15 minutes my lips started tingling and my throat started to tighten up. The itching finally stopped after 10 minutes. The tingling in my lips and throat tightening occurred with both the first and second dose. The staff kept me for around 45-50 minutes for both doses of the vaccine.  When going home I took 2 Benadryl.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

This lasted about 5 days and slowly got better. My taste would be ok in the morning then would go away again in the afternoon. I had two telehealth visit and they had me tested for COVID, I tested negative. I tested again a few days later and was negative again. My Doctor said it was most likely a viral infection.

Then in the evening, the feeling was more significant and I noticed red bumps on the back of my tongue and inflammation around that area. Woke up Thursday (today) morning with a sore/tender throat and the throat is red and imflamed.

Her condition worsened to feeling nauseous and blurred vision, so patient asked to lie down.  We found a quiet area in the employee break room for the patient to lay down.  and provided her a pillow, water, cool compress for her head, and later, orange juice for her comfort. We proceeded to call 911 for medical attention. EMS professionals evaluated patient&#39;s vital signs and patient signed waiver refusing to go to hospital, since she was feeling better. Patient left on her own accord with a friend driving her home.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

I started sweating, my vision started to turn black and I felt that like I was going to faint. I then became extremely nauseated and threw up. after about ten minutes the symptoms started mildly passing. I then began sweating again, feeling like I was going to faint, and I threw up a second time. These symptoms lasted for about an hour where I felt nauseous and faint. Then flowing these symptoms I felt dizzy for another 3 hours and continued having body aches for another 2 days.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

                                                While waiting in after the vaccination I experience the slightest discomfort with my breathing but thought it might be related to double masking. Upon driving home, I realized I had non-itchy and non-painful hives on the upper portion of my right cheek and the lower jaw on the left side. As time progressed, the hives disappeared from left side and moved down the right side of my face. After it passed on the right side it reappeared on the left side and followed the same pattern. My dermatographia also returned on my chest and I haven&#39;t had an episode of it for over year. The roof of my mouth was also itchy. All hives, itchy mouth, and slight breathing discomfort passed by 7 pm without the use of an antihistamine. No other signs of allergic reaction has been noted since. Breathing concerns passed the quickest (after 2 or so hours), then itchy mouth, and last the non-itchy hives. Other than that, I experienced the common side effect of body aches during the night and pain in vaccinated arm.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Immediately got redness of injection site feeling of nausea. Needed to take my mask off to get fresh air.  Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in the hospital. On 22Jan2021, roughly 90 minutes after vaccination (at 18:30) the patient&#39;s left eye got itchy and swollen. Both eyes and the area around the eye swelled. It went down upon icing and taking two over the counter Benadryl. However, the next morning, the eye was still a bit puffy and swollen. The events were considered non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovering. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.

My first dose of covid vaccine I had a tingling tongue and face and just took some Claritin and Pepcid. The second time around my entire mouth went numb and it felt like there was something in my throat. My airway was not impacted but it felt off. I was given 25mg of Benadryl and monitored for half an hour with vitals every 5 minutes. I?m 14 hours out from the reaction and I feel fine now.

When I got my Covid vaccine on 3/2/2021, and hour later, I began smelling smoke. I don?t smoke, nobody in my household smokes, it is not coming in from the vents, and nobody in my household can smell it. It?s nauseous and it won?t go away.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                I had a moment yesterday evening where I almost passed out (tunnel vision and my arms and legs went numb) followed by an intense urge to vomit. I instantly broke out in cold sweats and completely soaked through my shirt in about a minute. The intense sensations passed, but happened again at around 10pm as well. I?ve just woken  up for the day today, and so far I feel okay but I?m a little weak and extremely tired.

She had inspiratory wheezing to auscultation, VS stable. BP 122/72, HR 103, pulse oximetry 99%. She had albuterol MDI inhaler with her, I asked her to self-administer 2 puffs. I administered 25 mg of diphenhydramine. She declined 50 mg because she gets very groggy to anti-histamine.  Approximately 3 minutes later, she noted to feeling like her throat is very dry and warm, almost difficult to swallow. She describes sensation like she is breathing thru a straw. Her vitals remain stable: BP 133/74, HR 128, pulse ox 98%. Throat without swelling, redness, no stridors noted, but she continues to have inspiratory wheezing. She declined to have Epi given.

                                                I began having hives on my chest late Thursday night on the 18th, I took Benadryl to try and ease the hives. I continued to have hives spread across my chest, both arms, stomach, and the back of my knees from the 18-22, I suddenly lost my voice on the 21st when I woke up in the morning. I went to a park view clinic in my town on the 22nd and received treatment for my hives. As of the 24th I am taking medications prescribed to me and my hives are slowly going away and my voice is coming back. I have also experienced nasal drainage and a cough from the 19 and onward.

                                                I have been experiencing high blood pressure between about 140/90 and 130/85 with headaches and tinnitus. Blood pressure remains high throughout the day and was first noticed on 03/20/2021. I first took my blood pressure after noticing a mild headache that was not alleviated with hydration or OTC pain medication. Headaches have returned intermittently since 03/20/2021 but now only lasts 1-2 hours. Tinnitus was noticed several weeks ago (specific date is unknown) and is a mild and quiet but constant high frequency ringing. Unsure if any of these are related but I have never had tinnitus and my blood pressure is not this high nor do I have headaches often or back-to-back.

After my second dose my arm initially didn?t hurt but started to hurt hours later. I had cough and sore throat but the worse thing was I woke up with super puffy red eyes with green discharge coming out. I was fine until I got the Pfizer vaccine. The morning after I felt terrible. I called my doctor to see what he can do or prescribe for my eyes.
