                                                Swelling of the upper left lip on 05/20/2021 noticed when she woke up at 7am. No signs or history of trauma. Gave Benadryl 25mg liquid orally and iced the area. A second dose of Benadryl was given at 1pm as the swelling had not subsided. By evening her lip was normal.  When waking up on 05/21/2021 she noticed a approx 1cm ulcerative type lesion on her inner upper lip. The lip was swollen again, but slightly less so. Repeated Benadryl 25mg  three times that day at 6 hour intervals. Started on triamcinolone 0.1% cream prescribed by her pediatrician that evening.  On 05/22/2021 the lip was not swollen and the ulcer appears to be healing on the upper lip, but a small portion of her lower left lip now shows an approx 1-2mm ulcerative lesion. Triamcinolone 0.1%cream applied 3x daily.  She noticed a irregular confluent red rash approx 4cmx2cm on her right mid abdomen on Tuesday after swimming, but unsure if this is related. She had her regular maintenance allergy shots (one shot in each arm) on Tuesday at 12:15pm.

                                                I just saw a 12 year old in the office who has an odd rash that started the day after she got her first COVID vaccine (Pfizer). She started with the two on her right ankle the day following the vaccine, then the two on her left ankle started the next day, followed by one more on her distal left arm over each of the next three days. She says the burn slightly when she touches them but no itching, not otherwise painful. They look to me like burns or something similar. I wonder if they are self-inflicted but she denies causing them or anything new recently aside from the vaccine. She has been using neosporin occasionally since they were noted, no other treatments.  Other vaccine reaction noted: fatigue and slightly sore arm. She just completed a course of clinda for strep on 5/5. Otherwise just takes vitamin D daily. No recent open water swimming, etc.

Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

I went and got a nurse and she called a pediatric team - three nurses and one doctor - they took her vitals and gave her some Benadryl - 30 ML (children&#39;s). They had her sit and drink a bottle of water. We watched to see if the swelling and the hives would shrink and go away. It was probably about 20 minutes later where they went away, but she developed a headache and she was nauseated. We administered Benadryl (gave her regular 25 mg tablet every 6 hours)  for the next 24 hors in the dosage times. She was nauseated the first day and she had headache for two days. The hives went away by the time she went to bed the evening of the vaccine.

The arm that got the injection was also really hot.  I had the patient lay down, and gave her an ice pack for her neck/arm.  After a few minutes patient said that she felt better.  I had her lay down for about 5 minutes.  She then sat up and said she was much better.  Wasn&#39;t dizzy or nauseous anymore.  Arm felt better too.  I had the patient sit and wait in total 30 minutes.  Mom wanted to leave sooner but I asked if she wait so that we could make sure she was ok.  THey waited 30minutes and left .  patient was fine.

                                                She had a rash after school - she noticed it about 2:00 - she started getting a headache and around 03:00 - she noticed a rash (red marks - no bumps) on her knees and upper and thighs. About 3:20 - her right arm and a little bit on her left arm were almost like hives (bumps) - they were a little bit itchy off and on. The next morning, could still the bumps but not as bad, but on 19th after school it was back just like the day before. We gave Benadryl to see if that would help. In the morning it goes away - on her arms, she can see a little a bit of where the lumps are - not as bad; on legs it&#39;s just almost completely gone, and by afternoon it&#39;s back to full scale of where it had been the night before.  Could see where the bumps were in her arm but it is  not as bad as it was. Today, as far as I know from the last time I asked her, she said there are still some on her arms but not on legs.

                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

On June 13th, she showed me where a red circle had developed around the injection site.  On June 15th, she complained about sneezing a lot, a sore throat and having a headache throughout the day.  Later that evening around 9:30 pm, she started vomiting (2 episodes) and stated her throat pain was an 8 out of 1 to 10.  After vomiting her throat pain dropped to a 7.

An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

Her face looked gray and she said that she needed to sit down.  After sitting for a bit, she was able to stand up, but then proceeded to fall forward, as if she were passing out.  I was able to steady her and sat her back down.  Her eyes looked like they were staring off into space.  She said that she couldn&#39;t see me and everything was &#34;purple and yellow.&#34;  This lasted a few minutes and then I was able to get her out of the shower and dressed.  She then began to regain some normalcy and was fine after that.  She ate breakfast and rested.  She didn&#39;t have any more episodes after that, but I could tell that she wasn&#39;t as perky that day.  This episode was definitely not normal for my daughter, so I felt that I should report it.

                                                Wednesday night she got hives all over her back and face. It was itchy. I gave her Benadryl and she took her Zyrtec. The next day, I called the allergy doctor and and they told me to have her take 2 Zyrtec in morning and 2 at night. I think she took Benadryl that morning too and then Friday morning it was clear/she was fine. Wednesday you could see the hives everywhere; Thursday she complained of still being itchy and Friday she was fine.

                                                itching on the hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 12-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0168; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right at 4:10-4:5pm on 18May2021 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Reporter states the patient got 1st dose was 18May2021, lot EW0168, in her right arm before tennis practice at 4:10-4:5pm that on the sticker she had to wear it said 4:35 to leave after dose. States the expiry date is 31Aug2021. Caller does not have the NDC or dose to provide. Medical history included meningitis at 7 years old. she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and doesn&#39;t think that has a bearing on this. There were no concomitant medications. Patient had not taken other products. Patient&#39;s historical vaccine include Flu shot. Patient does the flu shot every year. Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect reported as none. Patient was not received any other vaccine prior four weeks of vaccination. On an unspecified date the patient experienced itching on the hands. Reporter states her school gave her the 1st dose on 18May2021. Caller reported with her first does of the vaccine, she had itching on the hands but didn&#39;t thought about it and perhaps that was a sign after the first dose. Reporter relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. After her 1st dose her hands itched, and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Reporter states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t talk about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said reporter that her hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell, and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non-severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Patient visited to physician&#39;s office for the events. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.   Follow up attempts are needed; further information was requested.

                                                6/12 - patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Worsened gradually with difficulty swallowing. 6/16 - presented to ED. Patient also reported rash in right lower extremity that is pruritic, 2 episodes of non-bloody non-bilious emesis daily since Saturday, intermittent chest pain and dyspnea, myalgias, diarrhea, generalized abdominal pain, and neck pain. Concern for infectious mononucleosis with lymphadenitis. Prescribed Augmentin and discharged home. 6/17 - returned to ED due to worsening rash (no longer pruritic) and diarrhea. Continued fever and neck pain. Hypotensive requiring 3L bolus and norepi. Large volume diarrhea. Mild AKI that resolved with fluid resuscitation. Treated broadly with antibiotics for toxic shock syndrome but rash was not consistent and cultures were negative, so eventually narrowed to ampicillin-sulbactam. Neck pain and swelling improved, but fever persisted through 6/19. Transferred to the floor on 6/20 and gradually improved without further intervention. Antibiotics were continued to target possible tonsillitis/lymphadenitis, but course did not seem to be truly responding to these antibiotics. CRP continued to increase despite antibiotics. Patient&#39;s presentation seemed most consistent with MIS-C; she also met criteria for incomplete KD with fever, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy and lab abnormalities, but this was felt less likely and she was not treated with IVIG or any other anti-inflammatories. Patient eventually improved and was discharged home 6/24.

                                                With the first dose: Headache (came and went frequently) dizzy(2-3 days) nausea (2-3 days) sore arm (3-4 days) gave ibuprofen for about 2 days and most symptoms went away. She continued to complain about a headache every once in awhile. About a week later I noticed  her eyes seemed a little yellow but it didn&#39;t seem to get worse and thought maybe she just need to drink more water and get some sleep.  After second dose: Bad headache (3-4 days) dizzy and nauseous (3 days) gave ibuprofen for 2 days. Two days after the vaccine she was fully jaundice. Hadn&#39;t notice because she was feeling bad from the vaccine so I just let her sleep mostly. Next day we got into see her primary care dr who ordered stat bloodwork and stat ultrasound. That same day she got some blood work back and told us to go to the er because her platelets were really low. At the er they diagnosed her with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which explained the jaundice. She was admitted and put on steroids. Her hemoglobin got as low as 5 and they cross matched her incase they needed to do a blood transfusion. They were concerned that there was a possibility that her immune system would attack the donor blood since it seemed to be attacking her platelets as well. Luckily the steroids started working and he levels creeped up a little. She also recieved 3 vitamin k transfusions and pain meds. When she was switched to oral steroids and her numbers were still rise they released her. She is still taking steroids and has weekly follow ups with Dr. . We are also in the process of getting a rheumatology referral to see if there is an underlying condition we didnt know about.

She started with left breast pain then developed redness and warmth of the breast. She was seen in the office for evaluation then sent for an ultrasound. The ultrasound indicated a 10mmx10mmx8mm abscess. She was then referred to a breast surgeon that day for surgical intervention. The surgeon did not feel that surgical incision and drainage necessary at that time and agreed with the plan to treat initially with antibiotics.

She has pressure on her chest on 09Jun2021. She had pressure behind her eyes, muscle pain,she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills , sore throat, nauseous, caller states she was assuming hives, inflammation stayed around awhile , body aches / pain through her head and back down her neck, trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful , she was slumpy, swelling from the digging and scratching, her hands began to swell yesterday in Jun2021. she woke up and said her face felt funny on 09Jun202. she was just not feeling right and couldn&#39;t walk by herself on Jun2021, Caller relays her daughter will be (withheld) . HCP: Caller states she called the pediatrician office and 1 was by phone and she was seen by this provider yesterday and she encouraged her to reach out to us as well. Mom states she was aware of the possible symptoms to occur and her daughter came home Tuesday perfectly fine and went to bed and woke up with the typical symptoms, she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills, sore throat, nauseous and had all the symptoms pretty much. States she didn&#39;t have anything weird going on during the observation time the day of the vaccine. Caller relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. Caller states she took a nap Wednesday about 24 hours after her 2nd dose and she woke up and her lips had begun to swell and she woke up and said her face felt funny and it was itchy. Caller states she was assuming hives. Caller states that there was nothing concerning as it wasn&#39;t in that initial 15minutes to 4 hour and that this occurs 24 hours after and that was a concern. Caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch and that was kind of along the same lines and said hives and she would itch itch itch and there was swelling from the digging and scratching. Caller states she has numbness in her lip with the swelling. Caller states the other symptoms that are bizarre is more yesterday and it started some on Wednesday she had a pressure in her chest and this was a child, her daughter was very strong, she got up yesterday and tried to do school and had a fever of 102 and Wednesday evening was so sick with symptoms and she still tried. Caller states the pressure in her chest is concerning and told them yesterday and she needed to be seen. States her daughter described it to the doctor that it felt like someone was sitting on her chest sort of pressure and on a scale of 1-10 she was a 7. Caller provides that not at any time did she experience trouble breathing and she never saw her lose or get weird coloring. Caller states she called her doctor Wednesday afternoon and talked to another doctor, that she called the help line after hours as they close 4:30 or 5pm. States she was told it was good news that she did not have trouble breathing but to have it at this point was weird and no one knows what to expect and everyone is different. States she was told to do Benadryl and continue with pain medication for fever and discomfort. Caller states her daughter was miserable the rest of the evening. Caller relays that the swelling subsided and the inflammation stayed around awhile and yesterday she woke up better with no nausea and the common symptoms are better and she still had the fever. Caller relays that at about 9:00 she began to have a problem where she said that behind her eyes she had significant pressure and that scared the caller what with the brain and swelling. Caller states her hands began to swell yesterday, like her lip and her fingers are itchy and swelling and it&#39;s constant itching and the pressure on her chest yesterday, that those 3 things freaked the caller out and she called the pediatrician and they said to have her checked out to make sure as nobody wanted to rush her to the ER as she was not struggling to breathe she was just not feeling right. Caller states the pediatrician did her research about heart inflammation and listened to her heart a couple of times and said her best observation for rubbing sounds was she did not hear any. Caller states when her daughter was younger she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and caller states she does not immediately rush to the hospital as that brings back emotions with that. Caller states the doctor said she didn&#39;t see any immediate distress and would do an EKG or they could wait and see, that she thought the pressure might be like body aches and her daughter had laid in bed all day the day before and had a time with it. Caller states she couldn&#39;t walk by herself and she was out of it. Caller states she could do the EKG or wait until today and they chose to wait. States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

At the time the error was caught, we contacted Pfizer who said that it is not harmful but that they are more likely to experience pain in the injected arm and should be monitored for symptoms. A claim was filed with rite aid corporate and the patient was contacted. At that time she was reporting pain at the injection site. The patient&#39;s pediatricians office was contacted and when the pediatrician spoke to the family they reported arm pain as well.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Pt received vaccine (1st dose, Pfizer lot #EW0185) at 9:42 am and was seated in observation area. Patient raised hand and told observation/charge nurse her stomach hurt and she wanted to use the restroom. When asked to describe pain, pt stated she felt a little nauseous. The pt also stated she felt sick before getting the vaccine. The nurse accompanied to the patient to the restroom, and pt used the toilet. When pt came out of the stall, the nurse asked if she was feeling better. Pt stated her stomach still hurt, and she wanted to go to the school nurse&#39;s office. Charge nurse escorted pt to school nurse&#39;s office. The nurse stated &#34;oh, we know her,&#34; and told charge nurse pt had frequent abd pain. Charge nurse left pt in care of school nurse and returned to vaxxing area. Nurse who administered vax to pt stated to charge nurse that the pt told her her stomach was hurting when she asked if she was well, and that it was an &#34;ongoing thing,&#34; and she was getting an ultrasound for it Friday. Pt had no fever and no other complaints, but stated she was &#34;only getting the vaccine because my grandmother wants me to.&#34; One-half hour later, school nurse came to auditorium asking if charge nurse could speak to pt&#39;s GM. Per school nurse, pt&#39;s GM had picked pt up from school d/t stomach complaint and now was on the phone with a question about vax SEs. Charge nurse spoke with GM on the phone. Per GM, pt had vomited x 1 and her ears were &#34;very red.&#34; GM stated pt had recent issues w/ vomiting, but was concerned that pt&#39;s ears were red. GM denied any itching, rash, SOB, voice changes, dizziness, redness or weals anywhere else, or other symptoms of concern. Advised GM to give pt benadryl following dosing instructions on bottle, give her small sips of water and bland food as tolerated, and monitor pt at home. If pt&#39;s condition worsened, GM should take pt to UC/ED immediately for assessment. GM agreed w/ plan of care.  At 2:30 pm, the school health director emailed the school site coordinator and told her the &#34;student had an adverse reaction after today?s vaccination. She is currently in the emergency room and the docs believe it is definitely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. ....She did speak with your NP who was on-site this morning after she was dismissed to home, and advised to take Benadryl. Symptoms worsened and she went to ER where she received 2 doses of epi.&#34; Charge nurse reached out to school health director for information on where pt was treated to call for a report of symptoms prompting the epi intervention, but had not received a reply at the time of this report.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

Went to the Doctor and she said it looked like an allergic rash. She told us that based on my daughter&#39;s genetics and her asthma -  (I (her mother) had an anaphylaxis with my second Moderna shot  - my entire body was giant hives.)- That he did not recommend her to have the 2nd shot. My daughter still has some of the rash - a little on her left cheek, stomach and back still. The itching is gone. She did take Benadryl for it.

                                                At 4:30 PM, the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her right arm at facility. She developed a headache, along with dizziness and pain at the injection site. She also reports that her arm began tingling and felt heavy. She waited for an hour without resolution to her symptoms. Around 5:30 PM, she began having intermittent episodes of shaking her limbs. There was no seizure activity. She reports that she has had these episodes since the beginning of the school year, but hadn&#39;t told her Mom. She reports that it mostly happens when taking a test at school. The episodes are worse today since taking the vaccine. Vitals: HR 110 BP 134/75 Sat 99% on RA. An RRT was called and she was taken to the ED.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

The reporter stated that the day the vaccine was approved [for her age group] she got her initial vaccine. She received her first vaccine dose on May 13th in her right arm, several hours later she began having left arm pain that has progressively gotten worse. She reported that after running her arm was in excruciating pain all the way down to her hand. She further enquired if left arm pain a common symptom of the heart swelling or inflammation of the heart following vaccination or is left arm pain something people have when they had heart swelling or inflammation. She further stated that hadn&#39;t happened the exact same day she wouldn&#39;t connect it so much. The vaccine was given in the right arm, but it is her left arm that is hurting. she called her pediatrician, and he is thinking it is coincidental or thinking maybe she hurt herself, but caller states she doesn&#39;t know but maybe she has a swollen lymph node that is putting pressure on a nerve. The patient took Tylenol for the reported events. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown at the time of reporting.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

Today, 3 weeks post vax#1, rash is still present. It is pruritic, covers entire torso (ant/post) from base of neck to pelvis/buttocks. Lesions are  variable from small (5mm diam) raised, erythemic lesions to large (2-3cm diam) hives. Lesions on the back are coalescing to cover entire back. Pt&#39;s mother stated the individual lesions are coming together-rash worsening over past 2 weeks. OTC Topical cortisone helping with itch, but not with lesion resolution. Enc pt to reach out to PCP-Pediatrician and discuss possible systemic treatment such as PO anti-histamine or steroid taper. Pt rescheduled for dose #2 which will continue to be delayed until rash is completely resolved. Suggested 30 minute observation at next vaccine appointment.

This progressed over the next several hours to the next morning to include swelling of the face and neck, tightness of the throat and chest, and progression of the rash to involve all of the arms, chest, and legs. The rash was a fine maculopapular rash that was itchy. Over the next 3 days the symptoms did not progress further, but they also did not subside. On day 7 after the 2nd dose, she was placed on a Medrol Dose pack. The swelling of the face and sensation of tight throat began to ease by the next day. After completion of the steroid regimen, her skin is dry and flaky with mild tightness in the skin of the face. However, most of the rash has gone and the tightness in the throat is absent.

She said her throat felt swollen.  A couple hours after a double dose of benadryl and ice packs she began to improve.   4th day she was much better. We spoke with her allergist over the phone, and he said it was reasonable to chalk the reaction up to extra stress on her body due to the vaccine/her bodies response to the vaccine. We only did half her peanut dose. 5th day she was normal.

                                                Patient said she felt immediate, strong pain in her arm from the jab the nurse gave her.  She said the needle was in her arm a lot longer than when she received her first shot.   I also watched patient receive her first COVID shot from a different provider, different facility, and I was surprised by the force of the jab of this second COVID shot, and length of time the needle was in her arm.  After the nurse left us in the room to wait 15 minutes, patient became more and more uncomfortable, hot, sweaty and nauseous.  Within 5 minutes, she was lying down on the exam table - at which time I alerted staff at the nurse&#39;s station in hallway that patient wasn&#39;t well and we needed help.  She said she would get &#34;the provider&#34; and be right in.  When I walked back into the room, patient was curled up in a ball on the table, pale, clammy and not able to speak.  I yelled down the hallway for help right away, and stepped back into the room.  Patient then began to vomit.  At least two nurses entered the room, and began to assess her vitals.  Her blood pressure was low, but she was breathing fine.  &#39;The provider&#34; (I don&#39;t know his name) came in and I told him about how hard she was jabbed, and that she began to feel badly immediately afterward.

I did take her to her primary on 7/8/21 he prescribed her benadryl . the next day got worse , so I took her to the hospital on 7/9/21. doctor drew a blood sample to check her organs she said everything  looked ok. So doctor said she was gonna report it and I was to do so as well. Symptons have not gone away and we are going on day 4 so  doctor said it should be gone in 3 days. So if shes not bring her back into hospital. I am very worried, and am up through out the night settting my alarm every 2 hrs to make sure shes not flaring up.

                                                Within 15-20 seconds of receiving the injection, my daughter who has NO history of seizures or health issues of any kind, , began having seizures. Her skin color becamee gray, her lips turned blue. The seizure last approximately 20 seconds and when she came out of it she was able to breathe but said her throat felt funny, scratchy, smaller - but she was still able to breathe. She was nauseous, head hurt and was very disoriented for approximately 20-30 minutes. The pharmacist called 911. 911 arrived and took her blood, did a multitude to tests which all came out ok. We opted not to take her to the hospital as she was breathing ok, and her color was returning.

She did not have hives but rather papules.  In the office her rash had resolved with the exception of mild erythema. She also complained of an itchy throat but had onset of rhinorrhea and sneezing yesterday.  She took benadryl yesterday which made no difference.  She had no cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting or diarrhea.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.

Pt was recommended to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting area after vaccination for observation, but she and mom opted to go shopping in the store. At approximately 3:37 PM, pt and mom came back to the pharmacy to tell me (the pharmacist) that she had hives and showed me red bumps on her left arm. I had the pt sit while mom went to go buy Benadryl. After 5 minutes, I checked on the pt. She had taken one dose of Benadryl and stated that she was dizzy and feeling itchy all over. After chatting with mom for 5-10 minutes, the pt stated that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening and were stabilizing. The pt then said she wanted to rest at home. I recommended she sit for a little longer, but mom stated she would keep a close eye on the pt and had an epipen at home. They then left the pharmacy. I followed up with mom on May 30th at approximately 4:00 PM to see how the pt was doing, and she stated that they were at the ER because the symptoms were not getting any better, and the pt &#34;felt like she was having an asthma attack.&#34; Pt&#39;s mom states that the pt is doing much better after receiving IV meds.

She was monitored until 3:30 pm and indicated her symptoms had resolved and she was feeling much better. Counseled her grandmother to monitor her closely this evening and to administer another dose of Benadryl if needed.

Rash didn&#39;t start the injection site - it was her other parts of the body. Warm to the touch and spreading. By like 10 minutes, it had reached full body. She didn&#39;t complain of itching. Nurses took her vitals - described heart as &#34;tacky&#34; -but as she calmed the heart was coming back to normal. She wasn&#39;t in any stress until I pointed it out and she looked and saw she had an issue. The nurses had been give her Benadryl that I had brought - gave her 27.5 dosage of it - two pills. 1/2 hour after taking the Benadryl everything had subsided and we left. There were no further symptoms with her skin. She still had congestion etc but no further skin issues. I called her Primary care doctor to alert her but they said they didn&#39;t need to see her.

                                                I have pictures I can upload. She had severe hives - flat, red rash on legs and arms. Very itchy; swollen ankles and swollen wrists and hands. She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

Reported 2-3 days later, had localized pain and swelling at injection site. On 6/2, reported she had worsening pain (&#34;like a bee sting,&#34;) swelling, and discoloration. Saw me for this concern in my office on 6/3 at which point she had minimal discoloration and no swelling, but site was still very tender to touch. I am reporting this because it is a local site reaction that occurred/persisted later than the expected timeline of 1-2 days after vaccination.

The reporter stated that, her sister was 14-years-old and she got the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine of Pfizer on Tuesday this week, on 08Jun2021 and began having bruising on her left knee, after a day on 09Jun2021, the patient felt like her legs are hurting and when she sits her knees has bruises on both legs. Stated that, the patient had got the first vaccine when she was 14 (further not clarified hence, not captured in tab). Stated that, on her research she has found that could be a rare side effect and wanted to know if they had any further data or report of this side effect. Stated that, the reporter had read all about the side effect and saw lot of scary things, it seems like rare condition to have, so the reporter concerned, was that really bad, do they had to run any test or something. Stated that, the reporter was calling and got disconnected so, she called in again. Stated that, the reporter was in the middle of filing a case about COVID vaccine side effect. Stated that, the reporter has concerns because her sister does not have a primary healthcare provider or insurance so she was unsure of what she should do. Stated that, the reporter was provided with the number of health department and she got the questions so, she wanted to call them tomorrow, it&#39;s Saturday so when they were working. Everything was good regarding this case right. Response included was advised caller, Pfizer cannot make independent patient recommendations and that she would have to seek further medical advice from a primary care provider. The dates and seriousness for the events were unspecified. The reporter stated that, the patient did not take any treatment yet. The investigation assessment was reported as no. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up actions are needed. Further information is requested.

She was originally misdiagnosed as having poison ivy and was given 2 steroid shots. That helped for a few days. She then saw the regular Dr who said it was a virus and was given 5 days f oral steroids.  The rash has persisted coming and going regularly in different locations all over the body. My daughter has also been much more tired than normal.  The regular Dr has referred her to dermatology but she can?t get in to be seen for several weeks.

She did not report any swelling.  She took a picture of it and I didn&#39;t see any redness, but it looked like there were some bumps that developed on her arm.  It may have been more than a week after getting the vaccine and she is not sure the vaccine actually caused that reaction.  I made the decision to counsel her on signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis reactions and to seek medical attention if needed and gave the second dose.  I saw her mother 5 days after she got the second dose.  Her mother said she hasn&#39;t had any reaction to the second dose.

Pharmacist did) RPh inspected injection site and looked red with scratch marks. Pt mom also showed a couple of spots that daughter thought might have been mosquito bites but mom said could be hives because there were multiple spots on thigh above knee above ripped jeans on right side. Mom also said pt had a spot on her back. Rph offered patient liquid diphenhydramine orally (50mg) (20mL of 12.5 mg/5mL diphenhydramine). Pt took orally and was asked to wait an additional 15 minutes. Afterwards pt said she felt ok. Mom said she would give her more benadryl at home if she needed it and would watch closely and if anything happened would take her to ER.

                                                Event: About 2-3 minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient had an erythematous warm rash, initially to the left deltoid and left antecubital fossa area (vaccine was administered in the same arm). The rash was flat and blotchy, some areas were slightly raised.  After about 5-7 minutes, the rash had spread to the patient&#39;s upper chest/ torso, clavicle areas, and upper back.  Patient stated the rash was not pruritic, just that the areas felt hot. No respiratory distress or wheezing, patient did not seem anxious.  She denied previous similar reactions to medications, food, vaccines, or blood draws in the past. Treatment: an ice pack was applied to the vaccine site on the left deltoid and left arm area.  Since patient did not have any rash to the face/ lips, and no respiratory distress, it was determined that she was not in need of IM Benadryl or Epi. We do not currently have PO Benadryl pills on site. Patient was instructed that she could take 50mg of Benadryl when she gets home. Education was provided to the patient that if she feels any throat closing, difficulty swallowing, tongue or lip swelling, or difficulty breathing at home, she should call 911 immediately.  I also discussed with the patient that she could consider taking 50mg Benadryl prior to her second COVID-19 vaccine appointment if she prefers. I discussed with her that if the rash was persistent tomorrow, she should consult her family/ primary care physician. Patient&#39;s mother speaks another language, and patient translated this information to her mother, and patient and mother had no additional questions or concerns.  Patient&#39;s mother was present with the patient in-person during the vaccine visit, as patient is a minor. Outcome: patient was observed in the observation area for 30 minutes to monitor for worsening of rash, and to monitor for any new developing symptoms.  Rash was largely resolved after 30 minutes with the ice pack, just a faint area of flat erythema to the left upper arm area around the biceps.

                                                Spoke with clients guardian about adverse event. Guardian reported nurse calling her after she went back to school after vaccine due to a rash on chest, lower abdomen, and from inside of arms from elbows to wrist on client. Mother took client to ER to be checked out. Per report of Guardian, ER doctor said, &#34;this rash shouldn&#39;t stop client from receiving second vaccine.&#34; Guardian also reported ER doctor prescribing Prednisone for 5 days and Benadryl as needed. Guardian did not say what ER doctor ended up diagnosing the rash cause.  Guardian reported client reporting rash was itchy, but Guardian reported she did not see client actively itching. Guardian also reported client very nervous about vaccine and was being told mixed messages about vaccine from peers from school. Per CDC guidelines instructed Guardian to have client evaluated by allergist before receiving second Covid-19 Vaccine. Guardian reported client is doing well now.

                                                Prior to arrival, the patient received her first COVID vaccine at the clinic, after which she suddenly felt dizzy, described as lightheadedness, and felt warm. She was noted to be hypotensive with SBP at 67. She subsequently drank water with some improvement. No syncope, severe headache, numbness, tingling sensations, or focal weakness. Mother was concerned and brought the child to the ED for further evaluation. Currently the patient feels better. No similar symptoms in the past. The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. No recent fever or cough.She is otherwise healthy and has a normal cardiopulmonary exam and reassuring EKG.  The description of her symptoms and the environment which happened is very consistent with vasovagal syncope and she does not have any stigmata, and acute neurologic or cardiac emergency.  I believe she is safe and stable for discharge home and she was discharged with return precautions and follow-up instructions.

                                                itchy; hives all over her body/welts/Multiple whelps; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s mother). A 15-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 16May2021 (at the age of 15-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0161) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included mensuration cramps. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) taken for mensuration cramps; paracetamol (TYLENOL) taken for mensuration cramps; ibuprofen taken for mensuration cramps. She was taking Motrin and Tylenol. Motrin was 200mg and she was taking, she didn&#39;t start Motrin until Wednesday, that would have been 18th and in 24hr. On Tuesday she took 400mg Motrin for the whole day and Yesterday she took about a 1000mg of Motrin in the 24 hour period. So she took it may be 3 times, so each pill is 200mg. She had her period and she was getting mensuration cramps, so that&#39;s why she was taking it. It&#39;s a gel cap. The Tylenol she was taking, she took on Wednesday that would have been the 17th she was taking Tylenol, so she was taking about a 1000mg coz they are 550mg per tablet and she was taking two times, may be three times. The patient received first of the vaccine on 16May2021. Last night 19May2021 around 11pm she was very itchy with hives/welts but then went away. Then at 4am extremely itchy on thighs stomach back, and then again today on wrist as well on thighs, stomach and back, down to her knees. She had been taking Benadryl and Zyrtec. She also got her period on 16May2021 and had been taking mostly TYLENOL and some ibuprofen. She usually took MOTRIN during her period and had no problems. The nurse stated &#34;My daughter took the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday, 16May2021 and last night 19May2021 she developed multiple whelps, hives all over her body, her abdomen, her legs, very itchy and it still continued on today. Now, she&#39;s 15, I have not taken her to doctor but I do plan to do that tomorrow but since you have a calling number for adverse reaction then I&#39;m thinking this might be a delayed reaction to the vaccine, I&#39;m not sure. Does that spell familiar?&#34; Nurse stated &#34;I have given her Benadryl and Zyrtec, only 25mg she got one last night that may be 5 in the morning and then she took another one about an hour ago 25mg. Two Benadryl 25 &amp; 25 today and last night and she took one Zyrtec. The Benadryl is in 25mg tablet orally. She took Zyrtec now, she took one its 10mg oral.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered. For Causality, Nurse stated, &#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking. She has not taken anything out of the normal, that the only thing I can think of. It could be.&#34;

A 15-year-old female patient (Reporter&#39;s step-daughter) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8736), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 15May2021 18:00 as single dose for vaccination. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No patient family medical history relevant to AE. No prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Patient broke out with a rash the following Monday evening, 17May2021 causing multiple visits to the Emergency department and Urgent Care Clinics. Reporter and patient are driving to patient&#39;s primary care physician&#39;s office now. Patient did not get admitted to the hospital. Patient has been to urgent care, and the emergency room a few times. The doctor from the emergency room believe that patient had a vascular reaction to the covid vaccine. The doctor asked reporter to call Pfizer to get some guidance. The doctor thinks that patient has an underlying autoimmune disease that caused the vascular reaction. The doctor put patient on a course of steroids because of patients reaction for whatever is going on. Reporter was looking for guidance about the second dose of the covid vaccine, since patient had this reaction. Reporter is not sure if prednisone will take away the effect of the covid vaccine. Reporter is asking what to do and where to go. Patient was told that she may have had a vascular reaction secondary to a possible underlying immune condition not yet identified. Mom stated that the child was prescribed Prednisone to counter the rash. Mom wanted to know if her child should go ahead and get the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine given the side effects. Patient broke out with a rash was reported as worsened. The patient was advised that she should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if she had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. People with a weakened immune system, including people receiving medications that weaken the immune system (immunosuppressants) were not in the clinical trial for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19; that may have a lower response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of rash was not recovered and outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 or comirnarty in triggering the onset of autoimmune disorder,vascular disorder,angiopathy cannot be excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

We administered some Benadryl gel.  The next day around 6 p.m. she woke up from a long nap and noticed she had several raised bubbly itchy bumps on her hands, legs, and feet.  I immediately gave her one benadryl tablet.  After taking to the triage nurse around 7 p.m. I gave her another benadryl tablet plus two Advil Dual Action tablets.  She awoke the morning of June 8th and all the symptoms she had the earlier night were gone.

A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it. The blotchiness and chest pain resolved quickly, but the itchiness continued. Patient also complained of stomach pain, which occurred after patient&#39;s grandmother gave her a loratadine. The loratadine settled the itching down, but patient reported nausea the next morning and shortness of breath, as well. Patient received Claritin 24 Hr for the events as treatment. The outcome of the skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs and chest hurting was recovered on May-2021 and recovered for rest of the events in 2021  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.

EMTs and Lead RN responded to the incident. Lead nurse signaled over EMT at approximately 12:44 that she needed the gravity bed for a client. The client was found lethargic when EMTs arrived with a gravity bed. The client was a 15-year-old female with a chief complaint of dizziness. Client?s older brother was present during incident. Interpreter translated information between EMTs/RN and client/client?s brother. The client was alert and tracking to voice. Per the lead nurse, the client was complaining of dizziness after the administration of her first Pfizer vaccination. The client had no known allergies or medical history. The client also did not take any medication. The client&#39;s brother stated that ?she had chicken nuggets and a smoothie? to eat at approximately 10:00.

The client was nauseous, dizzy and complained of numbness on both arms.  The client was unable to bear weight and not following simple commands before she was assisted to gravity bed by EMT and RN. The client then briefly lost consciousness for less than a minute before becoming alert to person, place, date, and event.  EMTs assessed vital signs every 5 minutes for a total duration of a 45-minute observation. Vital signs were taken by EMT with client lying supine immediately after losing consciousness (12:45) and were reported as follows: Blood Pressure (BP) 92/64, Pulse (P) 66, Oxygen Saturation (O2) 99%, Temperature (T) 98. Skin was intact, pale, and cool to touch immediately following patient regaining consciousness. Patient remained lying flat on gravity bed for approximately 10 minutes before she was assisted to a seated position. Patient was in a high-fowlers position when she was given a juice and granola bar. Client then stated that she was ?feeling better?. After an additional 10 minutes sitting on the gravity bed in high-fowlers position, the patient was assisted by RN and EMT from vaccination station to EMT/observation station. The client remained seated in the EMT/observation station for an additional 15 minutes. Vital signs were taken every 5 minutes during this time by EMT. They were reported as follows:  12:51- BP 112/78, P 69, O2 97%, T 98. 12:55- BP 108/78, P 77, O2 99%, T 97.9. 13:00- BP 104/78, P 66, O2 98%, T 98.1. 13:05- BP 96/62, P 83, O2 95%, T 98.1. 13:10- BP 92/68, P 76, O2 98%, T 98.1. 13:20- BP 90/70, P 92, O2 99%, T 97.6. 13:28- BP 92/72, P 93, O2 99%, T 97.9.   After a 45-minute observation, client stated her condition was improving and was observed walking normally. Client?s skin color returned to a pale pink and became warm to the touch. Client denied dizziness or any other symptoms. Lead RN educated the client about what to do if symptoms returned. The client was provided with the V-Safe form and EUA form with highlighted portions pertaining to symptoms to be mindful of. The client was also instructed to call 9-1-1 if symptoms of anaphylaxis, also known as a severe allergic reaction, presented. These symptoms include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, hives covering body, facial swelling and more. Client and client?s brother acknowledged understanding of information.
