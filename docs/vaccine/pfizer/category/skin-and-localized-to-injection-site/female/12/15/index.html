                                                Swelling of the upper left lip on 05/20/2021 noticed when she woke up at 7am. No signs or history of trauma. Gave Benadryl 25mg liquid orally and iced the area. A second dose of Benadryl was given at 1pm as the swelling had not subsided. By evening her lip was normal.  When waking up on 05/21/2021 she noticed a approx 1cm ulcerative type lesion on her inner upper lip. The lip was swollen again, but slightly less so. Repeated Benadryl 25mg  three times that day at 6 hour intervals. Started on triamcinolone 0.1% cream prescribed by her pediatrician that evening.  On 05/22/2021 the lip was not swollen and the ulcer appears to be healing on the upper lip, but a small portion of her lower left lip now shows an approx 1-2mm ulcerative lesion. Triamcinolone 0.1%cream applied 3x daily.  She noticed a irregular confluent red rash approx 4cmx2cm on her right mid abdomen on Tuesday after swimming, but unsure if this is related. She had her regular maintenance allergy shots (one shot in each arm) on Tuesday at 12:15pm.

                                                I just saw a 12 year old in the office who has an odd rash that started the day after she got her first COVID vaccine (Pfizer). She started with the two on her right ankle the day following the vaccine, then the two on her left ankle started the next day, followed by one more on her distal left arm over each of the next three days. She says the burn slightly when she touches them but no itching, not otherwise painful. They look to me like burns or something similar. I wonder if they are self-inflicted but she denies causing them or anything new recently aside from the vaccine. She has been using neosporin occasionally since they were noted, no other treatments.  Other vaccine reaction noted: fatigue and slightly sore arm. She just completed a course of clinda for strep on 5/5. Otherwise just takes vitamin D daily. No recent open water swimming, etc.

Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

                                                It was within 5 minutes, she started having hives that went down her arm and spread to other arm, face, trunk, legs, stomach. I went and got a nurse and she called a pediatric team - three nurses and one doctor - they took her vitals and gave her some Benadryl - 30 ML (children&#39;s). They had her sit and drink a bottle of water. We watched to see if the swelling and the hives would shrink and go away. It was probably about 20 minutes later where they went away, but she developed a headache and she was nauseated. We administered Benadryl (gave her regular 25 mg tablet every 6 hours)  for the next 24 hors in the dosage times. She was nauseated the first day and she had headache for two days. The hives went away by the time she went to bed the evening of the vaccine.

A 12-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1  at 12-years-old intramuscular, administered in arm left on 16May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that within 5 minutes after taking the vaccine on 16May2021, the patient started feeling dizzy, weak and little bit of shaking, chilling. Dizziness was kind of severe dizziness where felt like everything was moving around her. They took her to urgent care center because she does not feel ok after half an hour lying down there. The doctors were there and they gave medications as an injection of Promethazine 25 mg temporarily at first and also gave Ondansetron 4 mg and prescribed Meclizine 25 mg three times a day for 5 days as needed (treatment). The patient got the reaction at 1145 am within five minutes feeling dizziness. After 30 minutes waiting were advised to take her to the urgent care. She was prescribed Promethazine 25mg, Ondansetron 4mg, Meclizine 3 times a day for next five days. Reports adverse event (unspecified) still maintains. Then later developed a rash, whole left arm on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result which included injection of Promethazine 25 mg temporarily at first and also gave Ondansetron 4 mg and prescribed Meclizine 25 mg three times a day for 5 days as needed.

                                                She had a rash after school - she noticed it about 2:00 - she started getting a headache and around 03:00 - she noticed a rash (red marks - no bumps) on her knees and upper and thighs. About 3:20 - her right arm and a little bit on her left arm were almost like hives (bumps) - they were a little bit itchy off and on. The next morning, could still the bumps but not as bad, but on 19th after school it was back just like the day before. We gave Benadryl to see if that would help. In the morning it goes away - on her arms, she can see a little a bit of where the lumps are - not as bad; on legs it&#39;s just almost completely gone, and by afternoon it&#39;s back to full scale of where it had been the night before.  Could see where the bumps were in her arm but it is  not as bad as it was. Today, as far as I know from the last time I asked her, she said there are still some on her arms but not on legs.

The attending physician treated her for a severe case of hives   She said that it was due to an unknown origin.  Patient just received her 2nd Pfizer Covid shot on June 7 and on June 8 started breaking out  with hives  we now know the shot was the culprit.  Hope this is helpful information

                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

On June 13th, she showed me where a red circle had developed around the injection site.  On June 15th, she complained about sneezing a lot, a sore throat and having a headache throughout the day.  Later that evening around 9:30 pm, she started vomiting (2 episodes) and stated her throat pain was an 8 out of 1 to 10.  After vomiting her throat pain dropped to a 7.

It was swollen and painful.we didn?t realize it was related until she developed a similar rash after her second dose. 4 days after her second dose she developed a rash on her left arm and hands. Looked the same as the one she had on her knee- raised, swollen and her arm hurt.

Her face looked gray and she said that she needed to sit down.  After sitting for a bit, she was able to stand up, but then proceeded to fall forward, as if she were passing out.  I was able to steady her and sat her back down.  Her eyes looked like they were staring off into space.  She said that she couldn&#39;t see me and everything was &#34;purple and yellow.&#34;  This lasted a few minutes and then I was able to get her out of the shower and dressed.  She then began to regain some normalcy and was fine after that.  She ate breakfast and rested.  She didn&#39;t have any more episodes after that, but I could tell that she wasn&#39;t as perky that day.  This episode was definitely not normal for my daughter, so I felt that I should report it.

The next day, I called the allergy doctor and and they told me to have her take 2 Zyrtec in morning and 2 at night. I think she took Benadryl that morning too and then Friday morning it was clear/she was fine.

At the time the error was caught, we contacted Pfizer who said that it is not harmful but that they are more likely to experience pain in the injected arm and should be monitored for symptoms. A claim was filed with rite aid corporate and the patient was contacted. At that time she was reporting pain at the injection site. The patient&#39;s pediatricians office was contacted and when the pediatrician spoke to the family they reported arm pain as well.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Pt received vaccine (1st dose, Pfizer lot #EW0185) at 9:42 am and was seated in observation area. Patient raised hand and told observation/charge nurse her stomach hurt and she wanted to use the restroom. When asked to describe pain, pt stated she felt a little nauseous. The pt also stated she felt sick before getting the vaccine. The nurse accompanied to the patient to the restroom, and pt used the toilet. When pt came out of the stall, the nurse asked if she was feeling better. Pt stated her stomach still hurt, and she wanted to go to the school nurse&#39;s office. Charge nurse escorted pt to school nurse&#39;s office. The nurse stated &#34;oh, we know her,&#34; and told charge nurse pt had frequent abd pain. Charge nurse left pt in care of school nurse and returned to vaxxing area. Nurse who administered vax to pt stated to charge nurse that the pt told her her stomach was hurting when she asked if she was well, and that it was an &#34;ongoing thing,&#34; and she was getting an ultrasound for it Friday. Pt had no fever and no other complaints, but stated she was &#34;only getting the vaccine because my grandmother wants me to.&#34; One-half hour later, school nurse came to auditorium asking if charge nurse could speak to pt&#39;s GM. Per school nurse, pt&#39;s GM had picked pt up from school d/t stomach complaint and now was on the phone with a question about vax SEs. Charge nurse spoke with GM on the phone. Per GM, pt had vomited x 1 and her ears were &#34;very red.&#34; GM stated pt had recent issues w/ vomiting, but was concerned that pt&#39;s ears were red. GM denied any itching, rash, SOB, voice changes, dizziness, redness or weals anywhere else, or other symptoms of concern. Advised GM to give pt benadryl following dosing instructions on bottle, give her small sips of water and bland food as tolerated, and monitor pt at home. If pt&#39;s condition worsened, GM should take pt to UC/ED immediately for assessment. GM agreed w/ plan of care.  At 2:30 pm, the school health director emailed the school site coordinator and told her the &#34;student had an adverse reaction after today?s vaccination. She is currently in the emergency room and the docs believe it is definitely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. ....She did speak with your NP who was on-site this morning after she was dismissed to home, and advised to take Benadryl. Symptoms worsened and she went to ER where she received 2 doses of epi.&#34; Charge nurse reached out to school health director for information on where pt was treated to call for a report of symptoms prompting the epi intervention, but had not received a reply at the time of this report.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

                                                She had an upset stomach and was feeling really tired. Then the  next morning, she had a rash - itchy and bumpy -   torso, back arms and face. Went to the Doctor and she said it looked like an allergic rash. She told us that based on my daughter&#39;s genetics and her asthma -  (I (her mother) had an anaphylaxis with my second Moderna shot  - my entire body was giant hives.)- That he did not recommend her to have the 2nd shot. My daughter still has some of the rash - a little on her left cheek, stomach and back still. The itching is gone. She did take Benadryl for it.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

Therefore, she does not know if its from the shot itself or the change that occurred with the use of Tide. The outcome of itching all over was recovering. Outcome of other events was not recovered.

                                                Approximately one week after 1st dose of Pfizer covid19 vaccine, patient developed a rash all over torso. Today, 3 weeks post vax#1, rash is still present. It is pruritic, covers entire torso (ant/post) from base of neck to pelvis/buttocks. Lesions are  variable from small (5mm diam) raised, erythemic lesions to large (2-3cm diam) hives. Lesions on the back are coalescing to cover entire back. Pt&#39;s mother stated the individual lesions are coming together-rash worsening over past 2 weeks. OTC Topical cortisone helping with itch, but not with lesion resolution. Enc pt to reach out to PCP-Pediatrician and discuss possible systemic treatment such as PO anti-histamine or steroid taper. Pt rescheduled for dose #2 which will continue to be delayed until rash is completely resolved. Suggested 30 minute observation at next vaccine appointment.

                                                On day 3 after the second dose, she began to develop a rash on her face and arms around 8 pm. This progressed over the next several hours to the next morning to include swelling of the face and neck, tightness of the throat and chest, and progression of the rash to involve all of the arms, chest, and legs. The rash was a fine maculopapular rash that was itchy. Over the next 3 days the symptoms did not progress further, but they also did not subside. On day 7 after the 2nd dose, she was placed on a Medrol Dose pack. The swelling of the face and sensation of tight throat began to ease by the next day. After completion of the steroid regimen, her skin is dry and flaky with mild tightness in the skin of the face. However, most of the rash has gone and the tightness in the throat is absent.

She did not have hives but rather papules.  In the office her rash had resolved with the exception of mild erythema. She also complained of an itchy throat but had onset of rhinorrhea and sneezing yesterday.  She took benadryl yesterday which made no difference.  She had no cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting or diarrhea.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.

Pt was recommended to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting area after vaccination for observation, but she and mom opted to go shopping in the store. At approximately 3:37 PM, pt and mom came back to the pharmacy to tell me (the pharmacist) that she had hives and showed me red bumps on her left arm. I had the pt sit while mom went to go buy Benadryl. After 5 minutes, I checked on the pt. She had taken one dose of Benadryl and stated that she was dizzy and feeling itchy all over. After chatting with mom for 5-10 minutes, the pt stated that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening and were stabilizing. The pt then said she wanted to rest at home. I recommended she sit for a little longer, but mom stated she would keep a close eye on the pt and had an epipen at home. They then left the pharmacy. I followed up with mom on May 30th at approximately 4:00 PM to see how the pt was doing, and she stated that they were at the ER because the symptoms were not getting any better, and the pt &#34;felt like she was having an asthma attack.&#34; Pt&#39;s mom states that the pt is doing much better after receiving IV meds.

Rash didn&#39;t start the injection site - it was her other parts of the body. Warm to the touch and spreading. By like 10 minutes, it had reached full body. She didn&#39;t complain of itching. Nurses took her vitals - described heart as &#34;tacky&#34; -but as she calmed the heart was coming back to normal. She wasn&#39;t in any stress until I pointed it out and she looked and saw she had an issue. The nurses had been give her Benadryl that I had brought - gave her 27.5 dosage of it - two pills. 1/2 hour after taking the Benadryl everything had subsided and we left. There were no further symptoms with her skin. She still had congestion etc but no further skin issues. I called her Primary care doctor to alert her but they said they didn&#39;t need to see her.

                                                I have pictures I can upload. She had severe hives - flat, red rash on legs and arms. Very itchy; swollen ankles and swollen wrists and hands. She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

                                                Note: pt had vaccine administered at an outside facility; she thinks on 5/21 but not certain of the exact date. Reported 2-3 days later, had localized pain and swelling at injection site. On 6/2, reported she had worsening pain (&#34;like a bee sting,&#34;) swelling, and discoloration. Saw me for this concern in my office on 6/3 at which point she had minimal discoloration and no swelling, but site was still very tender to touch. I am reporting this because it is a local site reaction that occurred/persisted later than the expected timeline of 1-2 days after vaccination.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 14-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07Jun2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0196; Expiration Date: Sep2021) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162b2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0187, Expiration date: Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17May2021 for COVID-19 immunization and expereinced left arm injection site pain.

Caller stated the patient had a sore left arm at the injection site with her first injection and it was worse than the injection site pain this time. Caller stated it lasted about 2 days after her first injection, so 17May2021, 18May2021, and 19May2021. Caller stated this time with the second dose, the injection site pain was less than the first time, but now she has pain under her arm at the arm pit area. Caller stated after the second dose the injection site pain was just that day, so just one day, it wasnot bad. Pain under arm around arm pit area; left arm, same one she received the shot in. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of second dose: pain under arm around arm pit area; left arm, same one she received the shot in and second dose and left arm injection site pain with Advil.

Pharmacist did) RPh inspected injection site and looked red with scratch marks. Pt mom also showed a couple of spots that daughter thought might have been mosquito bites but mom said could be hives because there were multiple spots on thigh above knee above ripped jeans on right side. Mom also said pt had a spot on her back. Rph offered patient liquid diphenhydramine orally (50mg) (20mL of 12.5 mg/5mL diphenhydramine). Pt took orally and was asked to wait an additional 15 minutes. Afterwards pt said she felt ok. Mom said she would give her more benadryl at home if she needed it and would watch closely and if anything happened would take her to ER.

The patient passed out for a few minutes and responded after we both called her several times.  We called 911. She was feeling nauseous.  She sipped a little water and was looking very pale and was starting to become unconscious again.  Mother thought it was an allergic reaction and asked for Epipen.  Epinephrine was administered, and patient became alert and less pale.  EMS came and took her away due to low blood pressure

                                                Spoke with clients guardian about adverse event. Guardian reported nurse calling her after she went back to school after vaccine due to a rash on chest, lower abdomen, and from inside of arms from elbows to wrist on client. Mother took client to ER to be checked out. Per report of Guardian, ER doctor said, &#34;this rash shouldn&#39;t stop client from receiving second vaccine.&#34; Guardian also reported ER doctor prescribing Prednisone for 5 days and Benadryl as needed. Guardian did not say what ER doctor ended up diagnosing the rash cause.  Guardian reported client reporting rash was itchy, but Guardian reported she did not see client actively itching. Guardian also reported client very nervous about vaccine and was being told mixed messages about vaccine from peers from school. Per CDC guidelines instructed Guardian to have client evaluated by allergist before receiving second Covid-19 Vaccine. Guardian reported client is doing well now.

                                                Event: About 2-3 minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient had an erythematous warm rash, initially to the left deltoid and left antecubital fossa area (vaccine was administered in the same arm). The rash was flat and blotchy, some areas were slightly raised.  After about 5-7 minutes, the rash had spread to the patient&#39;s upper chest/ torso, clavicle areas, and upper back.  Patient stated the rash was not pruritic, just that the areas felt hot. No respiratory distress or wheezing, patient did not seem anxious.  She denied previous similar reactions to medications, food, vaccines, or blood draws in the past. Treatment: an ice pack was applied to the vaccine site on the left deltoid and left arm area.  Since patient did not have any rash to the face/ lips, and no respiratory distress, it was determined that she was not in need of IM Benadryl or Epi. We do not currently have PO Benadryl pills on site. Patient was instructed that she could take 50mg of Benadryl when she gets home. Education was provided to the patient that if she feels any throat closing, difficulty swallowing, tongue or lip swelling, or difficulty breathing at home, she should call 911 immediately.  I also discussed with the patient that she could consider taking 50mg Benadryl prior to her second COVID-19 vaccine appointment if she prefers. I discussed with her that if the rash was persistent tomorrow, she should consult her family/ primary care physician. Patient&#39;s mother speaks another language, and patient translated this information to her mother, and patient and mother had no additional questions or concerns.  Patient&#39;s mother was present with the patient in-person during the vaccine visit, as patient is a minor. Outcome: patient was observed in the observation area for 30 minutes to monitor for worsening of rash, and to monitor for any new developing symptoms.  Rash was largely resolved after 30 minutes with the ice pack, just a faint area of flat erythema to the left upper arm area around the biceps.

                                                Prior to arrival, the patient received her first COVID vaccine at the clinic, after which she suddenly felt dizzy, described as lightheadedness, and felt warm. She was noted to be hypotensive with SBP at 67. She subsequently drank water with some improvement. No syncope, severe headache, numbness, tingling sensations, or focal weakness. Mother was concerned and brought the child to the ED for further evaluation. Currently the patient feels better. No similar symptoms in the past. The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. No recent fever or cough.She is otherwise healthy and has a normal cardiopulmonary exam and reassuring EKG.  The description of her symptoms and the environment which happened is very consistent with vasovagal syncope and she does not have any stigmata, and acute neurologic or cardiac emergency.  I believe she is safe and stable for discharge home and she was discharged with return precautions and follow-up instructions.

A 15-year-old female patient (Reporter&#39;s step-daughter) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8736), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 15May2021 18:00 as single dose for vaccination. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No patient family medical history relevant to AE. No prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Patient broke out with a rash the following Monday evening, 17May2021 causing multiple visits to the Emergency department and Urgent Care Clinics. Reporter and patient are driving to patient&#39;s primary care physician&#39;s office now. Patient did not get admitted to the hospital. Patient has been to urgent care, and the emergency room a few times. The doctor from the emergency room believe that patient had a vascular reaction to the covid vaccine. The doctor asked reporter to call Pfizer to get some guidance. The doctor thinks that patient has an underlying autoimmune disease that caused the vascular reaction. The doctor put patient on a course of steroids because of patients reaction for whatever is going on. Reporter was looking for guidance about the second dose of the covid vaccine, since patient had this reaction. Reporter is not sure if prednisone will take away the effect of the covid vaccine. Reporter is asking what to do and where to go. Patient was told that she may have had a vascular reaction secondary to a possible underlying immune condition not yet identified. Mom stated that the child was prescribed Prednisone to counter the rash. Mom wanted to know if her child should go ahead and get the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine given the side effects. Patient broke out with a rash was reported as worsened. The patient was advised that she should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if she had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. People with a weakened immune system, including people receiving medications that weaken the immune system (immunosuppressants) were not in the clinical trial for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19; that may have a lower response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of rash was not recovered and outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 or comirnarty in triggering the onset of autoimmune disorder,vascular disorder,angiopathy cannot be excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                itchy; hives all over her body/welts/Multiple whelps; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s mother). A 15-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 16May2021 (at the age of 15-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0161) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included mensuration cramps. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) taken for mensuration cramps; paracetamol (TYLENOL) taken for mensuration cramps; ibuprofen taken for mensuration cramps. She was taking Motrin and Tylenol. Motrin was 200mg and she was taking, she didn&#39;t start Motrin until Wednesday, that would have been 18th and in 24hr. On Tuesday she took 400mg Motrin for the whole day and Yesterday she took about a 1000mg of Motrin in the 24 hour period. So she took it may be 3 times, so each pill is 200mg. She had her period and she was getting mensuration cramps, so that&#39;s why she was taking it. It&#39;s a gel cap. The Tylenol she was taking, she took on Wednesday that would have been the 17th she was taking Tylenol, so she was taking about a 1000mg coz they are 550mg per tablet and she was taking two times, may be three times. The patient received first of the vaccine on 16May2021. Last night 19May2021 around 11pm she was very itchy with hives/welts but then went away. Then at 4am extremely itchy on thighs stomach back, and then again today on wrist as well on thighs, stomach and back, down to her knees. She had been taking Benadryl and Zyrtec. She also got her period on 16May2021 and had been taking mostly TYLENOL and some ibuprofen. She usually took MOTRIN during her period and had no problems. The nurse stated &#34;My daughter took the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday, 16May2021 and last night 19May2021 she developed multiple whelps, hives all over her body, her abdomen, her legs, very itchy and it still continued on today. Now, she&#39;s 15, I have not taken her to doctor but I do plan to do that tomorrow but since you have a calling number for adverse reaction then I&#39;m thinking this might be a delayed reaction to the vaccine, I&#39;m not sure. Does that spell familiar?&#34; Nurse stated &#34;I have given her Benadryl and Zyrtec, only 25mg she got one last night that may be 5 in the morning and then she took another one about an hour ago 25mg. Two Benadryl 25 &amp; 25 today and last night and she took one Zyrtec. The Benadryl is in 25mg tablet orally. She took Zyrtec now, she took one its 10mg oral.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered. For Causality, Nurse stated, &#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.

We administered some Benadryl gel.  The next day around 6 p.m. she woke up from a long nap and noticed she had several raised bubbly itchy bumps on her hands, legs, and feet.  I immediately gave her one benadryl tablet.  After taking to the triage nurse around 7 p.m. I gave her another benadryl tablet plus two Advil Dual Action tablets.  She awoke the morning of June 8th and all the symptoms she had the earlier night were gone.

A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it.
