At the time the error was caught, we contacted Pfizer who said that it is not harmful but that they are more likely to experience pain in the injected arm and should be monitored for symptoms. A claim was filed with rite aid corporate and the patient was contacted. At that time she was reporting pain at the injection site. The patient&#39;s pediatricians office was contacted and when the pediatrician spoke to the family they reported arm pain as well.

Pt was initially not responsive, when transferred to a wheel chair to take her to a gurney, left arm &amp; left leg jerk twice. Took her to lay down and check her blood pressure. En route, in the wheel chair within about 5 to 10 seconds, she became responsive and said she could not see. Her vision returned to normal within a minute. Her initial blood pressure was 97/64 with O2 Sat 100% on room air. Her skin temp was 95.5, and her HR was 95. She continued to be responsive with excellent oxygenation and When the EMTs arrived she had a blood sugar of 90 and improving blood pressure with a regular rate and rhythm. Her diaphoresis resolved, and she continued to improve, tolerating water. Had similar reaction last year to flu shot, no hx of seizures

She did not have hives but rather papules.  In the office her rash had resolved with the exception of mild erythema. She also complained of an itchy throat but had onset of rhinorrhea and sneezing yesterday.  She took benadryl yesterday which made no difference.  She had no cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting or diarrhea.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.

Pharmacist did) RPh inspected injection site and looked red with scratch marks. Pt mom also showed a couple of spots that daughter thought might have been mosquito bites but mom said could be hives because there were multiple spots on thigh above knee above ripped jeans on right side. Mom also said pt had a spot on her back. Rph offered patient liquid diphenhydramine orally (50mg) (20mL of 12.5 mg/5mL diphenhydramine). Pt took orally and was asked to wait an additional 15 minutes. Afterwards pt said she felt ok. Mom said she would give her more benadryl at home if she needed it and would watch closely and if anything happened would take her to ER.
